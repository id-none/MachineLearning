as a parent you know the importance of having lots of binkys, these are great for the price.
Very nice! Good quality! I think my twin granddaughters will get plenty of use out of these!
We got this for a friend and sent it to them, but as far as I know, there are no complaints!
perfect to keep an eye on the little on while driving and she can see me as well. its great!
Returned...person I gave it to said it wasn't needed in the particular<br />playard I bought
so cute, love how it plays abc's.  really cute, soft and well made.  would highly recommend!
i like the gate. it works perfect for keeping our dog out of area that we do not want her in
pairs perfectly with the wonder mat to create the perfect play space for your little b ones.
Love it! We can easily strap this in with the baby in her carseat and it keeps her pacified!
This is the only kind of binky my daughter will take, so happy to be able to find them here.
holds the perfect amount of wipes for long trips but fits really easily into the diaper bag.
I was able to make a corsage for the baby shower out of it and it was so cute and different.
this is so handy to have in my bag.  i find it so convenient to have everything in one area.
So happy I got one of these! My little girl finally can keep it in her mouth! Plus it's cute
My son is obsessed with these. Plus they're super easy to spot if they fly across the room!!
This pacifier and the other one almost like it are great baby stop making sounds in seconds!
My son was such a fan of the wubbanub, now I buy them for all my friends that are expecting.
great quality product! love the brushes, they work the best so far with the ones i've tried.
my 1 1/2 year old grandson rolled the balls over and over and over again.  great simple fun.
These work great... Hospitals use them and they're the only pacifier my daughter would take.
not too much to say, but these are the only pacifiers our 7 month old will take.  Good price
great price! will buy again and again for nieces that are born in this family. she loved it.
seems to be working , my son feels like a big boy with his potty watch , helping the process
really liked this accessory for the pac n play. made it nice for the baby to lay on. like it

essential my baby loves this-<br />a pain to clean but child loves it so much I deal with it
This product is softer than what you can buy at our local stores. Good product. Very pleased.
my little one. loves it we bought 2 of them one for his bouncer seat and one for the car seat
Love this item! Clears space in my diaper bag for other things and the prints are super cute!
Wubbanubs are an absolute must have in my book and the dragon is the best one! Love love love
Awe is so cute.  The pacifier edges close around the nipple for clean storage. Great product.
Bought this for my friends baby and had some good laughs! and it shut him up for a while too!
The best pacifier in the world  (according to my grandson).  Bonus as toy.  Easier to find!!!
I ordered the blue. They did not have holes in the nipple and my son keeps them in his mouth.
So nice and small, soft and great for little hands. Will see how it holds up in a few months.
I do think it makes my Co-workers uncomfortable when I break them out during a stressful day.
These items are $10/15 in the stores.  This was a great gift for my husband, for my daughter.
This is so cute. I got it to go along with a baby shower gift this should come in very handy!
great car seat especially when it is hot.  only complaint is small straps - need more length.
We needed another one and this fit the need. Who know why but it has become the new favorite.
So soft and baby can easily grab it and put it in her mouth. Plus it's so adorable we love it
I preparied for my baby, who wil be born in Aug, and havn't use it. I think she will love it.
It's so so cute. Hope that my baby will love it. It's looks pretty good. And it is well made.

it does what it's supposed to. soft to the touch - proper fit - this cover is our primary now.
This was the brand and model my girl was given at the hospital and that's all she's ever used.
works great! harness buckle sits forward more which makes it easier for bigger/older children.
Gave these things to a friend as a gift for their new baby and they have been really helpful .

my wife loves this... i mean absolutely loves this. so she's happy... which means i'm happy...
these are beautiful and will go with anything (especially darker wood).  very sturdy and safe!
Excellent. Works much better than the &#34;orthodontic&#34; ones we also have. Never falls out
Our daughter loves this more as a little stuffed animal than for the pacifier.  But it's cute!
My 6 month old son loves it!  I get a lot of compliments on it.  very cute when he's using it.

she loves it, this is the pacifier that stays in her crib because she only sleeps with this one
Our favorite brand of pacifier hands down! We have tried Avent, Nuk, and various mustachifiers.
Avent does not have many graphic choices when it comes to pacifiers. these are cute and do glow
Cutest thing ever- I die when I see my son using this pacifier. Stays in mouth and cleans well.
i like it if the price can be cheaper. it will be very good. colour is nice. and it is usefull.
I purchased as requested by a mom-to-be, and it made a great add-on gift to tie to the package.
Even cuter in person! High quality & very huggable. She sits up well on her own on a shelf too.
I think this is more for the parents then the baby. I got it as a gift and the parents loved it

Cheapest Price On The Net!! Your child will sleep through the night, guaranteed!! LOVE THESE!!!
Love the glow in the dark nuks!  They work perfect at night to see and pop back into mouth;). .
I got this for my son we received so much compliments about this & he was just so cute with it.

So funny and great, giving as a gift!  Can't wait till they see it and the little one gets here!
these worked great for my twins.  i was able to use it with them before 9 lbs due to the velcro.
Love these pacifiers, they are nice and small so they don't over consume the baby's entire face.

it fit the mattress great and did not slide off  it was also very soft and washed and dried well
i use these liners all the time for my little one and they are a life saver for babies with gas!
the best gift i have ever purchased for a new baby. they are excellent quality and oh so so soft
what's better than muslin in the summertime?  it breathes and is comfortable for your little one.
where is the baby in the night??? hahaha you can find it with this! Just kidding but its great :)
i bought a cheap one before ended up throwing it away. this aquaus diaper sprayer serves me well.
The only pacifier my baby will accept.  I bought 12 of these because, like socks, they disappear!
These are just too cute for baby.  Bought a number of them in all kinds of animals and creatures.
They gave my little man a soothie in the hospital when he was born, and now its all he will take.
Great product, great price! I have no idea about the other reviews I found these to be very soft.
I used these for both of my babies. They are the best! No more searching for a pacifier at night!
the spout allows you to put pre-measured preferred formula into even skinny bottles with no mess.
I gave (sent) this item as a gift and was told they were delighted with the product.  Thank You!!

Exactly what I thought it would be. An easier more productive way to take care of your little one
it is great for my baby's clothes. love the color and it goes well with the crib from same place.
Great bottles and the gift set is a good deal if you compare prices at any store that sells them!
These paci's glow brightly in the dark, I was very pleased with them! Well worth the money spent!
i love this monitor. it works perfect so we can keep our eyes on our little girl while she sleeps
My baby wasn't a fan of this particular paci, but they were good quality and exactly as pictured.
Does what I need it to do... Works great! I wish I whould have got one five children ago. So cute
my kids love this set. i ended up having to buy 2. it is sturdy and easy for little hands to use.
Perfect size, and just too cute! Baby is coming soon, but I'm sure he'll love it as much as I do!

easy to use, easy for baby to grasp, handy for teething and for dangling toys from play gyms, etc.
Love these! The shape of them allows my daughter to get a good suction and they stay in her mouth!
loved this, and loved that we had a game for the &#34;little&#34; girls to play at our baby shower
Love that these are all natural rubber and in one solid piece to prevent germ growth in crevasses.
to be honest i actually prefer these over the medela ones. you really can't beat the price either!
It has a great quality of video. I have two other of different brands and they don't work as good.

Hilarious! Quite strong and durable. Extremely good for a giggle. Even funny when adults use them!
I bought this as a gift.  The mother seems to really appreciate it, so I guess it does its job :-)
These are so great for peace of mind!  No chemicals and our kid loves them for naps and bed times.
We have a special needs son and this turtle was easy for him to grasp and hold on to. He loves it.

My grandson loves the wubba he holds on to the little giraffe ,so cute to watch him with his wubby
My baby loves it!  She could hold it and put the paci back in her mouth when she was 3 months old.
this is great to keep an extra pacifier inthe diaper bag. if you use soothies it will only fit one
this is a good bottle brush. we've had many and i think this one is just as good as any we've had.
This pacifier was a life-saver. My daughter loves it and it's less likely to fall out of the crib.
This bag looks better in person.  I love that it has an easy velcro closure and it holds up great.
keeps my baby occupied more than any of his other toys while i clean my house! i love this gym set
I bought this for a little girl I babysit. She loves her wubbanubs! She has at least four of them!!
We have several different brands but My 3 month old baby loves these best. Soft and easy to clean .
This is our third Wubbunub binky as back up. It is a great size for little hands and little mouths.
I really like this because I can fit two paci's and I attached it to my diaper bag for easy access.
I love these. I use them for my business and I order them all the time. My customrs love them also.
I love these pacifiers. Their open air design doesn't leave a rash on my daughter's sensitive skin.
My son loves it and it matches his NYY outfits, great deal a must buy to all the daddies out there.
our baby boy just loves it. he spends almost 2 hours every day through out the day on his jumperoo.
our daughter loves it and it allows for both my wife and i to do homework while our daughter plays.
the baby is 16 mos now and still likes the sounds. even my 14 yr old cat likes it. he naps with it.
The porch steps are wide and the gate needed an extension.  This works fine.  And looks decent too.
This here is her best friend! She loves it, doesnt like other wubbanubs- the monkey takes the cake!
My friend loved the product. Very reasonable & got the product in time for her baby shower. Thanks!
This is a great idea for infants. The shape and weight of the toy helps keep the pacifier in place.
the best pacifiers. hands down. The base is so thin that they are less likely to cause an overbite.
This is still working. Place in freezer & give to my great grandson as needed. He's still teething.
Just the cutest thing and the baby took to it well. Easy to find with little animal attached to it.
Really liked the item. It is very simple to attach to any bags or purses and take with me anywhere.
This is not only cute but loved by the baby and parents. I think it is a wonderful gift for a baby!
i bought it as a gift for an expectant mom and i believe it will be perfect for organizing her car.
this was my sons favorite teether and toy. he loves the crinkle sound the &#34;bunny ears&#34; make
Just under 20 for all 4 same ones at Walmart. And get 1, just under $5. Just informing ya'll... :o)
Really nice basket gift , very good value for money, gave it in a baby shower and was very pleased.
What can we say?  It's a Wubbanub. It's literally the only thing that motivates my child to behave.
it was exactly what i expected. really simple and easy to use. i have used it daily with no issues.
I get such a kick out of watching my 'Lil Guy when he uses this. Very well made, sturdy. Good item.
my almost 3 year old is still using it. he climbs on it so easily, and is relatively easy to clean.
These are great. They stay in the mouth really well. Easy to find in the crib because of the color.
A great gift for the newborn - and their parents!  If you don't know what to give, this will do it!
this bassinet sheet is very soft and good quality. it is a very good buy, and i will purchase more!
great pacifiers and these do glow in the dark for a period of time, which made them easier to find.
Very cute. My child isn't a big pacifier fan but I bought it because it's so cute.<br />A good buy.
this product was made very well, but my grandson didn't like being in there so we use it as a gate.
Very cute and excellent quality, although my son never used it (he never took to a dummy/pacifier).
the temperature / thermometer reader on this was so helpful when baby was an infant!!!  great idea!
Great paci holder. You can fit two of any brand inside. Attaches well to your bag and great design.
I bought the wubbanub for my sister's son and he loves it! It is easy to manipulate and super cute!
I love horror movies and bought this pacifier for my son. I love that vampire boy, so does my wife.
My baby loves this and hold onto it. It's definitely a soother and the variety of animals is great.

I buy a set of these for every friend that has a new baby. They are adorable and always get a laugh.
i am very satisfied with my purchase ,the timing was incredibly accurate .i'll buy from them again .
this has made bathing baby a breeze. super easy to use, dry, and reuse. much better than washcloths.

I am pleased with the product. My child does not care for it but he is just not a paci baby I guess.
very warm, i love it! fits into our mclaren perfecty. long enough for my very tall almost 2 year old
My three month old son loves his wubbanub. In fact its the only one he will use. So glad I found it.
the handles are easy for my baby to hold and i like to use it for bananas when we are out and about.
my daugher loves her pillow and is only 15 months - she snuggles it and sleeps with it! i recommend!
its took a time for my daughter to get use to it, but it was worth it!!!!!!! no leaking, nice color!

this butterfly was even prettier in person.  i think it's really gorgeous and the colors are perfect.
great bottle for my baby!  breastfed at home and bottle fed at the babysitter.  very easy transition.
This makes life SO much easier! No more fishing around in the dark or having to turn lights on! Love!
so far my breastfed baby will take this bottle.  i never found a bottle that my first son would take.
i bought this for my grandson. He loves it and has to have it all the time.  I ordered some more too.
My baby loves this pacifier. If we try to give him other he spits them out. Apparently they are good?
we have high chair and this bebepod, but use this chair every time - it is way easier. started at 7m.
This was a gift, shipped to another address. Recipient love it, but I didn't get to see it in person,
Was a present for my new great-nephew, and per his mother, he loves it!  Seems to calm and quiet him.
daughter loves to throw, and loves these. much easier than dr. brown's if looking for a glass bottle.
i thought we could get away with just using a trash can in until our room started to seriously smell.
well received! i bought for a baby shower gift. it was a requested item from the mom's baby registry.
This is incredibly adorable and very durable. It says 0-6 months but it works fine for my 2 year old.
love this thing.. easy to put on and to slip baby into with one free hand. i definitely recommend it!
Naturally drawn to the bright red color, this is a great addition to out teething/pacifier collection
my daughter loves her new nap mat.  she uses it daily at daycare and it has held up well in the wash.
the kids said their lunch is super hot everyday<br />it is very easy to keep lunches hot in it thanks
These are amazing! Tried buying all the cute pacifiers and they spit out all of them except soothies!
I tried several other kinds of pacifiers but this is the only one she will take. She is 3 months old.
I've try over 7 different pacifier in the last few months and this is the only one my daughter takes.
i love this product!  when using it i can now have both hands free to read my book and drink my water.

my grand daughter love this but i do have  some concern about cleaning it. But i really like this idea

I got this as a gift for a sweet little girl.  My god son had one and loved it.  I think she will too!
great mattress protector. it has washed well and seems to be really well made. i will be buying again.
Love that these glow in the dark. Makes it easy to find it in the middle of the night! Great pacifier.
I gave this as a baby shower gift and it was a huge hit with the parents and grandparents. Stachified!
this small animal is great for my 3 month old to hold on to allow her to find her pacifier on her own.
the first teething toy we found that our 6 month old will use and loves to chew on. i would recommend.
My son loves this giraffe pacifier. It is one of his favorites and we have been through a lot of them.
great toy! easy to grasp and bring to baby's mouth. i also bought the 4 inch ball and baby loves both.
i used these for a lamb themed baby shower and they were a huge hit! great toy for not a lot of money.
Both parents loved these! The pink hat was a little big for a newborn but they like the carhartt pink!
Very well made and perfect for car rides.  I can give it to my baby and not worry about him losing it.
if you have a snoogle you must buy this. such a soft and comfortable difference. i absolutely love it.
love the bigger shield. pumping is difficult for me and this helps yield more due to less restriction.
Newborn baby loves these. Much easier to hold and manipulate than pacifiers that have a moving handle.
The little man enjoys it. It is just hard to make sure the little dog does not think it is his toy. :)
my baby girl loves her bear it helps her sleep!! it helps get her to sleep and it shuts off on its own
My son took to his wubbanub with ease. He loved the alligator and refuses to let any one play with it.
very cool product that adds a lot of safety for kids when bathing. fit like a charm on our bath spout.
nice that they come with covers for the nipples, cant think of too much to say about a pacifier though
this a great way to keep my baby warm without having to turn the heat up in the house...a must have!!!
Not the same material as the ones we got in the hospital but my LO will take them over any other paci.
This was a hit at the baby shower!  Everyone loved it and laughed so hard and asked where I bought it!
Very good product!!!!I have been using it on my baby and he is now 6 months old....Thank you very much
Got this for a baby shower gift.  Very soft.  I washed it upon arrival and it did well in the laundry.
I was what I was lloking for.  Im expecting my baby and this pacifier are perfects<br />thank you ! :)
How I went many years without this when my kids were growing up I will never know! These are awesome!!
our baby doesn't even use it as a pacifier, but she still likes to hold the stuffed animal at bedtime.
it was just too cute my granddaughter loved it i would buy more and tell my friends about them love it
it took my daughter just a couple of tries to warm up to her new pacifier.  i'm so happy she loves it!
this cover is cute and very soft. we like the print and it looks and works well for us. good purchase!
the is a great pack and play for the price.  it's just what i wanted.  i recommend this pack and play.
a big hit a xmas. perfect fit to size. warm yet not so hot that they wake up hot. grandkids loved them
this is great! it adds more space for them to roll. it works great on hardwood too because of padding.
I like these better than the Nuk brand because they are one piece.  No water getting in to the middle.
Loved the teeth. They look great on the babies and are also a great gift for my equally goofy friends.
These are as cute as they can be.  I doubt anyone else will be giving Cardinal pacifiers at the shower.
this memory book has everything you could possibly want to document with plenty of spaces for pictures.
Bought the WubbaNub for our new baby grandson. Turns out he took right to it and loves it. What a find!
What a great gift these baby pacifiers have made.  I just had to have a few to send to my good friends.
This was a gift for the only baby boy in our family, and it is adorable. LOVE IT, and so does his mama.
Cutest binkys I've ever purchased, my daughter loves them, and all MAM products!! Deff reccomend these!
All 3 of our boys loved these. The hospital and the over the counter ones never cut it apparently, LOL.
I love the dog and all the other critters that I have ordered. Will order lots more for the grand kids.
Bought lots of these as my dog keeps stealing them and chewing them up.  Baby likes them a lot as well!
Its cute and I hope that it will work for the new baby in August. The babys room is baby jungle animals
I BOUGHT THIS PACIFIER FOR LOVELT DAUGHTER IT WORKS AND IS A GREAT PACIFIER FOR ANYONE WITH A NEW BABY.
Love the monkey! the only bad thing is that it's not detachable to replace but I sewed a new one to it.
I love this pacifier. The fact that it's one piece is great! Easy to keep clean and it's safe for baby!
great quality sheets at a bargain price! fast shipping, good packaging, trusted seller. will buy again!
Easy to keep up with and just adorable.  Every baby needs at least one! I will purchase again for gifts
You got to love pacifiers that have the Atlanta Braves logo on them.  We are great fans and love these.
These are the best. They do not leave marks on baby's face and the rubber is good when baby is teething
I like it. I like toy with pacifier. Toy is very soft and light. The pacifier is soft and good quality.

this is a great shirt for any fan - excellent color and the material is good - definitely recommend it!
Our Baby Boy loves these!!! He's 7 wks old and just starting to hang on to them .. These are very soft!
These are the only pacifiers either of my sons would use, they are great!I would buy them again & again
holds cold very well for breast milk but just not large enough. if slightly larger it would be perfect.
i love it and the price is cheaper,i will buy it next time,i wish the shipper will be faster next time.
My son loves it. We named it monkey and monkey goes everywhere my son goes. It's also very easy to find
I thought this was a waste of money but our baby girl actually loved it more then her regular pacifiers
My Grandson loves it... As soon as he put it in his mouth there was no letting go.<br />Perfect Product

i was very happy with this crib skirt.  the color was a little darker then shown, but looks very pretty.
love this chair. it's really sturdy and can handle anything a toddler will do to it. wipes clean easily.

was durable and exactly what i wanted as it was a shower gift and fit the motif for the new baby's room.
These come in handy when u want to clean pacifiers and bottle nipples and u are not near a water source.
The cutest binkies ever. My son loved them as a newborn but has decided he prefers MAM as an older baby.
love this, the small stuffed animal helps paci stay in place and acts as a toy and a soother all in one.
bought to fit in a 58 year old crib, not the best fit but works well.  seem tone made of good materials.
my 3 year old daughter loves it. she turns it on every night. i would definitely recommend this product.
Love them and the baby loves them too.  What more can you say about Rockies pacifiers.  Go Go Rockies !!

So cute, my nephew took to it right away. Also easy to find if dropped.  Would definitely buy one again.
Daughter loves the bug! We bring it everywhere, & she now chews on the legs...what ever keeps her happy!
this is a great bouncy seat. it is a little difficult to change the batteries but otherwise we loved it!
The go to pacifier. Helps keep it in baby's mouth and something for them to grasp. My daughter loves it.
When the baby drops them, the dogs have a party. Easier to keep off the floor than the standard pacifier
item was as described and i am extremely happy that the item was received on or before the promised day.
Great price!!! It looks just like the picture! It's perfect for a little girl. I can't wait to use this.
Just like the one the hospital gave us except in blue and the only pacifier my son will take. Lifesaver!
Chosen because they are all silicone but I keep getting more because they seem to be my son's favorites.
It's so cute and beautiful. It's a great gift and it liked so much. I will buy some more. Great article!
Convenient and cute. It is nice to have on the carrier.  It matches the diaper bag well too.  I love it.
the brushes are perfect for little mouths. one for the kid to play with and one for mommy to do the job.
Great quality stuff, it looks great and it's not going to fall apart anytime soon. Woo hoo! It's so fun!
Works wonders on a cranky baby.  Highly recommended for any new Mom or Grandma!  A must for the nursery!
Very good and cute soothie. My son picked up on this immediately and easy/soft for him to hold on to it.

Cutest thing ever and my lo loves it! it's so easy to find at night when he pops it out and cries for it.
my baby girl started to use it from 1monnth to 1year-old nearly, with from s to m size. love it very.much
The nicu introduced our daughter to these paci's they are a life saver, hospitals trust them in preemies.
My son will only use NUK. I've tried other brands and he's spit them out. The sport designs are adorable.
My daughter's favorite and now mine.  Can't find them in stores so Amazon makes it so easy to order them.
nice product, kept the mattress dry and clean and fits well.  easy to wash and dry.  definitely recommend
these sheets fit great and are extremely soft!  i was lucky to have found them on line and priced rights.
This is the only pacifier my son likes.  I like that it is similar to a bottle so it doesn't confuse him.
Baby loves these. I love that they are pure silicone and they have as ring for attaching a pacifier clip.
i love this print! the diaper seems to be well made. my newborn is still too small to wear it yet though.
It's of very good quality. We like that it has raised sections on all for corners, not just on the sides.
my pediatrician recommended bandanas for my teething son and these don't disappoint.  i love the designs!
Love this pacifier. When I wahed it for the first time the fabric on the belly and feet faded to white :(
they should be very proud of their product.  better than described.  wonderful.  thank you so much. patty
this looks really cute on the crib.  it was easy to get decorations to match the colors of the comforter.
keep our baby dry, they're absorbant and the velcro is much better then the cheaper bibs. looks cute too.
oh i love these for ,y daugther, the material is great soft and they wash really well. i have to buy more
We have a puppy one.. which we like a bit more because the legs of this one gets in the way a bit more...
We've tried a lot of pacifiers -- these are the one my son loves.  He is now 8 months and still likes em.
Love! Works well as a weighted pacifier for my daughter. It's harder for her to lose it out of her mouth.
this car seat really lives up to its hype. it is very easy to use and my daughter loves. thanks amazon!!!
These are just like the ones that they give you at the hospital. But there are no more smooshed noses LOL
shipping was fast. and bag was exactly as it was decribed and pictured. gave it as gift and she loved it!
I absolutely love this paci holder! It's too bad my son doesn't take a paci anymore, but I recommend 100%
i recommend this to every one with a baby or toddler.<br />this is better than a regular belt. i love it!
these are nice items to have. i like the fact that there is no adhesive and they are easy to move around.
LO seems to like the free-flow a lot more than the regular pacifiers, they are spit out A LOT less often.
we put this around our dining room to keep our puppies out and it looks awesome there. very good product.
so nice, big, cuddly and soft, i used all during my pregnancy and even after. i absolutely love it!!!! =)
I just love the look and they are easy to clean. My three month has no issue going from nipple to bottle.
been on two trips and so far so good. holds our chicco car seat and mountain buggy nano at the same time.
These paci's are amazing! My boy loves them!!! They are super cute and easy to clean too! Love love love!
This is the best. No more lost pacifier. My son loves to hold it and can easily put it back in his mouth.
great quality product!  my daughter loves her wubbunub so much that we had to buy a second just in case!!
Great!  Baby's second one. Had to get a duplicate. Easy for him to hold and less likely to loose. Thanks!
This pacifier is really cute. Gets lots of loughs. It's kinda' small so it's good for 0-6 months i think.
i love these i bought 2 threw them in the wash and dried them too no shrinking and no wrinkles! love them
baby loves it.  I recommend getting two or more so you will have a backup in case his favorite gets lost.
My son and I both love this paci.  Its so cute plus its easy to find.  I would get all of them if I could
My son and I both love this paci.  Its so cute plus its easy to find.  I would get all of them if I could
my nephew loves butterfly so i thought that buying this one will be fun. nice toy and a lot of activities
this Is a great product I definitely recommend it. I absolutely loved it exactly how I expected it to be.
It was exactly what it said it was. Nice that they specify so you don't have to worry they might be pink.
My daughter lives these things! She can hug it to hold it close and fling it across the room at 2 months.
We have used mam pacifiers for all three of our children. They are the only ones my little ones will use.
this is an amazing little toy for my grandson, it really catches his attention , and makes him smile alot
i loved this. it's so cute. my 2 year old wears it for painting. easily washable and adjustable for size.
wonderful seat! it's so comfortable and sturdy, and we can tell already it'll be safe and last many years.
you must get one!! i prefer the silicone instead of the mesh way easier to clean and it's a great teether!
I love this product, it's fun and it came in a really nice original package. I highly recommended it. xoxo
Much more firm then I expected, but I kinda like that. My son enjoys it. Cool toy. Worth the money for me.
These are great but my baby didn't take them--not the products fault. It is well made and worth the price.
Our daughter loves this giraffe. It worked well for us and lasted almost 2 years. No she has a Giraffe #2.
Works great. If dropped it closes and so doesn't get the pacifier dirty. Very cute and a light green color
easy to clean, small and compact.  easy for my small 2 year old to sit on it.  only 2 pieces to keep clean
We use nothing but soothies right now and our daughter loves them. Unfortunately, we keep losing them. LOL
The kid loves it - 9 months old. NON LATEX - perfect for us since my husband as bad topical latex allergy.
I tried every single brand of pacifier for baby and wouldn't take to any but these. These were the winner.
it's everything i wanted in a wet bag: light to carry, easy to open, easy to clean, and keeps the odor in.
When my baby wakes up hungry or need to change it and she cries a lot, this is the one that makes it easy.
The first one that arrived didn't work, but a couple of days later I had a new one at my door! Very happy!
this was a popular item at my great niece's baby shower. soft and pink and cuddly...what more is required?
My son absolutely LOVES these pacifiers! They smell really nice and seem to calm him down if he is crying.
This was a big hit at the baby shower!  Everyone could relate.  I would recommend it as a fun shower gift.
Go these for some friends (Carinal fans) they seem to not like it i love it! Excellent product keep it up.
babies love this toy! it crinkles and has all different textures on all 5 corners. definitely a must have.
Great product, that does not hide the baby's face. I do not have anything more to say regarding this item.
Haven't had water get inside of them like most and they don't fall out of my sons mouth. No cons as of yet
really nice gift.<br />Would definitely recommend.<br />Loved the teddy bear and the blanket is very soft.
We e tried a lot of pacifiers, and this became a fast favorite. We now have two, in case one goes missing.
Who doesn't love these? They help a lot with nursing babies. They latch on much easier and laid back suck.
I got this kitty pacifier for my daughter that is expecting so we haven't used it yet,but its really cute.
Love it only con is that I wish it was easier to clean! I'm going to purchase another one for my new baby!
I like this pacifier pod because it matches the bag I purchased form JJ Cole.  I look forward to using it.
My go-to gift whenever anyone has a baby - every item I'm bought from the Wubbanub collection is adorable.
I bought these , cause they matched they other things I bought. and they seem to be comfortable for  Baby.
Everyone got a kick out this very funny mustache. It has been the main thing for the baby when taking pics
Great pacifiers. Quality plastic and the baby loves them. Bought two packs to make sure we don't lose any.
Bought these Wubs as shower gifts.  My grandson loved his and they are so much easier for babies to grasp!
i have a newborn baby.this diaper pail is great so far for me!i never smell any odor.i love the foot pedal
very cute and worked well, usually she uses nuk orthostar but these seemed to be liked by her just as much
Great product!  A little big for a newborn, but my son has grown into his mustache quite well! :) Love it!
These are by far our favorite pacis for DS. Close when dropped, what more could you ask for in a pacifier!
Thus is my third little one who loves these pacifiers!  The flex design is awesome! Mimics nursing nicely.
The only pacifiers my son ever liked. The same as the one he got from Lucille-Packard Children's Hospital.
Great binkie. My 3 month Old sucks it while grabbing the reindeer. So cute. Easy to take out and wash too!
I thought parents were crazy when they raved about the wubbanubs but they are a lifesaver and a must have!
i'm so glad i have this. i know i would lose much more sleep were it not for the reassurance of the snuza.
I have been looking for one for my Grandson.  This is a must have for infants.  He loved the bright color.
Perfect. A little big for newborns, but at least he can keep it in his mouth better than the rounded ones.
My baby loves that. He has 3  different ones. It is easier to find by himself during the night in the crib
This is the only pacifier my baby will take. It keeps him quiet and relaxes him so I give it all the stars
The 4 pack was a good buy. Our baby tends to loose the pacifiers often. So it was nice to get 4 at a time!
These are very funny and we are glad we got them, grandma doesn't appreciate them as much as we do..lol :)
Amazing.... Buy it awesome! The best pacifier in the business. I love it and so do the children, buy lots!
These are the best things ever.  I only wish they had been around when my kids were small.  We now have 4.
best buy for baby food storage! i recommend this to all moms that are using the baby bullet to store food.
We had such a hard time finding these in newborn size. My Granddaughter loved it and we so loved the smell.
nothing much to say, it is what it is a pacifier... My daughter doesn't like silicone, so it does the trick
THE PACIFIER IS PERFECT. THE SKULL LOOKS REALLY GOOD. I REALLY LIKE IT. IF YOU LIKE SKULLS. THIS ONE WORKS.
We use these and the similar Gumdrop paci but these are just a little softer and our little one's favorite.
Baby loved them.  They don't cause rashes.  Best part:  easy to find at night without turning on the light!
My 4 month old daughter loves these. I think they are easier for her to keep in her mouth than the soothes.
matches great, fits security, gives cozy feel and protection without making me nervous as cloth bumpers do.
Baby can see his paci in the dark. I'm sold. And Amazon is the only place I can find the 2 pack. Thank you!
i bought this for my nephew for the zoo and some other public events and it definately got put to good use!
this was the perfect pacifier for my baby and the only one she could stand after trying more than 10 types.
What I love most is the fact that its one piece & easy to clean,<br /><br />Also- these are extremely cheap
I brought the pacificers as a gift for my grandson.. It was exactually what I wanted..its for my sons  son.
Baby is not born yet ...so I do not have a great review on that . But I like the texture and shape<br />Thx
The best pacifiers for those middle of the night wake ups . they glow in the dark so they are easy to find.
Out of all the different pacifiers we tried, theses are babys' favorites. Don't waste your money on others.
this is the most price effective pad i have found. it is a nice standard size and fits all the covers well.
So cute my babys love these. I think probably because it's got a stuffed animal my son's love to cuddle it.
My little guy loves this, it is the perfect size and lightweight. Best thing we have gotten for him by far!
Fast shipping, expected what showed up to my door. Second purchase of these for my girls. Needed a back up!
I was pleased with them. I bought them as a gift for my brother and sister in-law. And they loved them too!
My son loves these. He also likes the newborn size better than the 0-6. I recommend parents try both sizes.
This is such a great pacifier!  My son can easily hold it in his mouth and can grab it in case he loses it!
Wubbanubs are the only paci my baby will take.  The alligator is really cute and easy for him to hold onto.
This is the only brand of pacifiers my little one will use and she loves the cute animal pictures on these.
My son uses it but it is a tad heavy for him at this time. I am sure he will use it more as he gets bigger.
Just a small thing for my niece who just had twins.  I think the labels will get laughs from their friends.
Only pacifier our baby will take. These wonderful silicone/rubber blobs had saved us many sleepless nights.
My daughter requested these for her new baby. They seem to be good quality and are very cute. Nice product.
perfect for our toddler she loves to close the latch on it and then she cant open it. safe and sticks good!
Just what we needed to avoid the pacifier from always falling out! Nice soft animal makes for a cute lovie!
just what we needed to avoid the pacifier from always falling out! nice soft animal makes for a cute lovie!
very cute - our baby loves this!  and, it's not been lost yet - even though it goes out of the house daily!
This is a really funny, yet still practical gift for parents. I bought it as a gift for my sister. Love it!
Best pacifiers we've found...we've bought 4 and will buy more.  Slight curve fits well for sleeping babies.
love this idea. i have a 2 year old who is potty training.  this will be perfect for traveling and camping.
good product. as expected. no compains. if you compare prices and is the best, there is no hold back to it.
bgh or my new born - e s 6 months old nw, still loves it!  Always easy to find and baby loves to cuddle it!
bgh or my new born - e s 6 months old nw, still loves it!  Always easy to find and baby loves to cuddle it!
I think this is priced a little bit high, but it is worth the money. My grandson, age 3 months, loves this.
Fast shipment! Love the color and size for a newborn.  Great gift idea for the new little one in your life.
The only nuk my daughter will take! I love that it is all one piece, so there are no mystery funk  growing!
exactly as described and it holds loottss of stuffed animals. i have been looking for one of these for yrs.
So cute and soft!!! My daughter will not take any other pacifier. The wubbabub helps from paci falling out!
It is soft and perfect for little fingers.  Will have to wait to see how it washes, since giving as a gift.
these are fantastic!  they are really substantial and rugged.  they absolutely stay put.  really great buy.
These are so great! I have a few and my babe just loved them. They are the same binky used in the hospital.
These pacifers are cute.  They are easier to keep up with.<br />The baby can hold onto the pacifer as well.
smaller than i expected, but my daughter loves it and refuses a larger pillow even though she is three now.
my grandson loves his ! got these for the baby shower and hes 4 mos now and uses it regularly its very cute
Nice product! I love that.I always use this all year ,so I will buy this in the following days ,thank you .
Sight and sound allows for peace of mind while still being able to monitor adults who cannot be left alone.
this is a geat prouct! the girls play with it every single day! i like the different options the piano has.
Adorable! Can't wait to 'meet' my nephew and see him with a little mustache!!!! The pics will be priceless!
This was my coworkers favorite and my stepsister's favorite for their kids. Great baby shower gift to give.
i put my kids snack in this and they eat it in the stroller. it holds a lot and holds their drink in place!
Fun!  as good as it looks in the picture.  goes great with a wide assortment of headgear . worth buying it.
The only brand our lactation consultant recommends, & now the only kind our daughter will take. Love these!
So did we. Cutest thing ever. We kept it in the car and baby loved to play with it on car trips. Well made.
She can snuggle the bear and it helps keep binki in her mouth plus no else has the pink bear great purchase
Baby loves it! It gives her something to hold on to and helps me to find her paci while I'm up front in car
no complaints with this gate it works great!  i can't imagine that the baby will figure out how to open it.
LOVE this wubbanub, the giraffe's neck means the pacifier can be positioned easier than some of the others.
It was a gift I was looking for.  Couldn't find even at Disney.  They should make many more different styles
Just what I expected thanks I would def buy again and/or recommend to friends and family. My Baby loves them
Pretty much a waste of money at $9 but is very cute and funny. Could be used as part of a Halloween costume.
perfect to keep your little one entertained in a bubble bath, which isn't an easy task some nights for sure.
They actually glow! We call our baby our glow worm now. Great quality, and we'll definitely buy these again.
this was for a gift, but my daughter loves hers and i used hers yesterday and loved it.  will purchase again
love this stroller.  it's lightweight, fits through most doors and easy to open and close!  very satisfied!!
this is a great case, well made. you will not be disappointed with this case, i guarantee it... great value!
Love love love this for my little guy. These are the ONLY pacis he likes!! Nothing else works like these!!!!
great gate. intalls easily and is very durable. does everything a gate is supposed to do, and it looks nice.
Our particular daughter Mia loves the pink binkys so she was very happy to receive these in the mail quickly
My son Just loves this since he was 16 days old  and won't accept any other pacifier, very useful, thank you
Holds two nuk pacifiers at a time. Great for keeping them clean and safe! I have green and love the color :)
My daughter will not use any other pacifier.  They are durable and I love that they came in pink and purple.
The regular Nuk pacifiers gagged my newborn daughter but these 0-2 month pacifiers suited my baby just fine.
This is one of the best inventions ever. It pacifies the baby as well as giving him something to hang on to.
very nice product. will work very well hanging from a stroller. a pacifier pod, what will they think of next
i need it .because useful.Want a discount.i will buy it once more.i love my baby and happy birthday for you!
wubannubs have to be the best pacifier by far. I think it's the least likely to mess up a toddlers teeth!!!!
Not only are these adorable! They are really great quality! It is soft and comfortable. My nephew loved it!!
You just cant have enough pacifiers in the crib so the child can find them in the night time.  Good quality.
This passy is really cute, and can rest on the babies chest or side to anchor it in place (if you're lucky).
you get what you see in the picture, works great for securing my toddler in the rear of my camaro just fine.
My baby boy loves his wubbanub pacis! I think the bull is sooo supe cute! The animals help the paci stay in!
Super fast delivery. One of the best things that I purchased for my little bug. It's easy to hold and clean.
my friend plans on cloth diapering her kiddo and i thought these monkeys were adorable so i bought a pair :)
bought this for a friend and she loved it... looks large but its thin but hey its hello kitty.. shipped fast
Very good item. I loved to open the bottom to clean the bottle. The scale is very helpfull to make the milk.
My little girl loves her wubbas!  Can't wait for her to see this in her Easter basket.  She's gonna love it!
my g-daughter is teething now and i bought these to help her. i keep them in the frig and really likes them!
We love our wubs! I have recommended to many friends.  If your baby uses a soothie pacifier these are great!
So much easier for them and you when they are still to young to hold on to things. My son loves both of his.
Looks good hanging off the side of the nappy (diaper) bag and you always know where the dummy (pacifier) is.
Perfect for our 2.5 y/o. She takes it to church, we even put extra clothes, coloring books and her snacks :)
Part of a baby gift that was in response to invitations that was monkey-themed. A hit at the shower.  Score!
My daughter loves this!!! She is a breastfed baby and this is the only thing that calms her when I'm at work
loved it!! had a lot of fun. the Mother to be enjoyed this game and<br />everyone played it.  Great Game Fun
Got this for my nephew.  It is a real conversation starter when he has it in.  People love it and so does he
Love that there is no &#34;wrong way&#34; for baby to put in his mouth. Also love that it is made in the UK.
I love these pacifiers and these aer the only ones that my son will take. These are easy to clean and cheap!
arrive unharmed and well before expected date.  works like a charm and makes our shopping trips much easier.
i am confused with this rocking chair.<br />it shows not available , then it shows being shipped on 12/10/14
This is the second time I am buying it. The teat is flat and I can tell my son prefers this shape to others.
It's super cute, but the best part is how much my niece loves her ducky. I think every baby should have one.
My daughter loves these binkies. They are great! Watch out if you have a dog. They seem to like them also...
You will always have a paci on hand with this! It attaches wherever you need it so you won't be without one!
Son isn't a pacifier baby but when he does want one, this is it. He just loves it over the others we bought.
everything i expected i loved this product just as much as i loved the movie the lion king when i was a kid.
Very good pacifiers, the only my baby loves. Used it from 6 months to 18 months. Easy to clean in dishwasher
We loved our &#34;molly monkey&#34; until the dog stole it and ate the nipple off the pacifier.  super cute.
My son will only take NUK brand, so these were perfect.  Such a great price!  I hope to never run out again.
Received the package VERY fast and I am really pleased with the paci tho so for a diaper cake I am making :)
i purchased this item for my daughter. she loves the bag. i would consider another one of a different color.
My daughter hate pacifiers but she love this. She just chews every part of it. And it makes her super happy.
huge towel! perfect! this is exactly what i was needing for my son. thanks. it's pretty soft and cozy.. good
Protector is easy to apply and is holding up really well. Excellent product. I'll buy my next one from here.
Gave as a gift at a baby shower.  Was listed on Mom's baby registry.  Have not heard any issues from new Mom.
I love the product. Very cute and it stays longer than normal pacifier. But, it is much small than I thought.
got this pacifier for my first granddaughter i luv the fact that it says princess on it so very happy with it
thanks it came quickly and it is super cute! looks great in the baby's room. i like how it can change colors.
my child is 9 and loves this seat belt adjuster.  keeps the seat belt off her neck and helps her feel secure!
these have been the nicest baby blankets we have ever had. they are very large which make it easy to swaddle.
These are the only pacifiers my son will actually take; he loves them! They're the perfect sizes for infants.
My nephew will only stay calm with these pacifiers and has become much less gassy! We buy these in the bulk!!
My nephew will only stay calm with these pacifiers and has become much less gassy! We buy these in the bulk!!
Wubba Nubs are the next big thing. Ordering and shipping were a breeze. Our baby girl loves her owl. Thanks!!
Seem to disappear like socks in the dryer but I always come back for more because baby Charlotte loves these.
This worked great for my son. Always on hand & doesn't fall when he spits it out. & it's completely adorable.
Cute.. well made.  Great gift for both parents to enjoy... they will get a good laugh at the baby shower!  :)
Great for finding the paci while you are sleep walking into your son's room. They really do glow in the dark!
My son is EBF and he loves his MAM binkies! I love that I can find the glow in the dark ones easily at night.
My kid has an obsession with pacifiers- will only use mams. If we try others, he freaks out. I like them too.
Fun baby shower game.  We actually used it for the little ones who were there and they had great fun with it.
I got it for my friends baby as a silly gift. They loved it! Not cheap and the baby seems comfortable with it
Item was part of a baby shower gift. Recipient loved it. Will order again in the future for additional gifts.
My granddaughters favorite she will not take anything else other than these binkys. Nothing else soothes her.
This is such a cute idea. I spent the first months of motherhood looking for an ON/OFF button. This is great!
Awesome! Easy to find and easy for my baby to hold on to. He is now 6 months and uses it at sleep times only.
these are my preferred utensils for my toddlers.  they are easy to grip and easy to use.  i highly recommend!
My baby loves this thing! not sure if is a good thing, but he totally loves it! makes a perfect gift as well.
i like because is beauty and is original design.<br />it is comfort and the two pacifiers help my little baby
bought this for a christmas gift for my new grandson i hope he likes it.......will get back after he opens it
works as described no problems with it. it saves running up and down the stairs to check on kids at nap time.
This is a cute pacifier and goes along well with the nursery and baby shower theme of elephants and giraffes.
The monkey is my son's favorite wubbanub.  We have several as they are all that he will use.  Just love them.
a super quiet swing my baby luvs it tried other expensive swings too but nothing can match this one too happy
definitely worth buying! my two year old loves it and the set is a great quality. we are happy with this set.
My Grand daughter loves them. This is the only kind she will take.  Plus they are cute and easy to hang onto.
grandson loves his mat. was very happy with the item. will order more for the other grandkids  thanks do much
my daughter carries these around all day! no mess and easy for the little ones to snack at their convenience!
My grandson owns about every wubbanub & he loves them! We didn't care for the fur in the ears. Still love it!
great mirror...i love how big it is and how it shifts to different angles so you are always able to see baby.
My daughter requested these for her new baby.  They seem to be good quality and are very cute.  Nice product.
These are my daughter's favorite binkies. She is 5 months old and it fits on her well and the colors are fun.
This product is perfect.  It won't fall on the floor.  I wish they made these in the vanilla scented Soothie.
These are a great buy, great product. I love these but my baby girl decided for the thumb instead of the paci
this is the first new system i've owned, and am very pleased with it  features are hard to figure out though.
Our twin girls love them! They provide comfort for them when in the crib. One of their favorite toys as well.
The plastic tube is made of cheap plastic, therefore, do not use hot water to wash, it will shrink the tubes.
i love it. so pretty my god daughter loved it as well.  good quality blanket. nice material and warm as well.
we bought a few of these for our newborn and liked it so much that we bought this one for a friend's new baby
Arrived quick and was exactly what I was expecting! Looks hilarious! It is a must have for every single baby.
I bought two of these as gifts for my friend that was having twins.  Her boys both use and love these things.
Good camera, even in the dark, and very good sound, it does not have any interference. The product  is great.
seems good, looks cute, waiting for the baby to arrive to try it out.  Love the skull on it.  Its Gerber Goth
We are diehard Cowboys fans and I had to order these for my new grandson! My son n law wasn't too happy...lol
my daughter is much more comfy now, very happy w the purchase. i feel better knowing she feels better. happy!
the color its great for boy or girl,  its not too heavy,  it has a support for babies neck.  i really like it
My daughter loved these pacifiers!  They were the only ones that she would take, and they are super cute too!
I ordered these as a baby shower gift and the mama is happy with them so far and glad that they are BPA free.
i have been using this stroller for 6 months now and totally love it. i am recommending it to everyone i can.
if you are looking for a good chew toy for a baby, this is it! she is now 13 months and she is still using it.

my son loved this from about 2-5 months. however it only holds a iphone 4 and 4s. unless they had upgraded it.
For my granddaughter.  She has been raised on avent pacifiers and bottles.  Her mother swears by this product.
introduce first food fun and keep baby from choking, too. lots of fun for baby, easy prep and clean for mommy.
High quality. One of my daughter's favorites! It's just like the Soothie she got as a newborn in the hospital.
My baby loves these pacifiers and I already bought two more, they are great and easy to find around the house!
I have several of these because we can't be caught without them. Baby loves them and we all want baby happy...
these are our preferred paci at our house.  Glow in the dark makes it easy to find in the middle of the night.
great product love it! buy a little more then you think you need doesn't come with much. my daughter loves it!
i recomend this buyer it is quick and responsable and the thing a bought it is as expected buy a recomend them
really cute for adding little suzy's zoo to your baby collection of things. will order more as needed to then.
These are the only pacifiers my baby will take, even though she's 7 weeks! They calm her down pretty well too.
this quote reminds me of my little sister and i love the fact that they included instructions on how to apply!
it suited our crib like it was made for it!<br />now we have our summerholiday, and we make love in the grass.
My babies would only take the binkies we got at the hospital.  These were just like them so they were perfect!
super cute and easier to fill out and keep track of milestones than a traditional baby book. highly recommend!
Only pacifier my NB would take. Perfect fit for his mouth. Ended up ordering more , you can never have enough.
Light, inexpensive and easy to move around. If space is scarce, this is for you. The plastic is easy to clean.
Love it and the concept of these pacifiers.  My grandson loves his dog so this was a cute idea for a pacifier.
My baby loves it! We have several for her and she loves them. Just as pictured and that's always a good thing!
we never get any smell and we keep it just for pooped diapers. it is easy to use, practical, compact and nice.
love these! my son sometimes pees all over and has projectile poo, so these come in handy. i bought two packs.
love this. it's easy to install and makes your tv safe from accidental tipping. i'd rather be safe then sorry.
very satisfied a shopping experience, product quality is very good, very satisfied with the speed of logistics
Good product - the glow-in-the-dark feature is a stroke of genius. My son prefers this brand, so it works out.
My son has chubby cheeks and these wont put a mark on his face . love the product , they are made in England .
My grandson has every wubba nub made and this one just added to his collection and he loved it.  Very pleased.
definitely worth it! it worked and made pumping time go by faster because i could use my hands!!!! i loved it!
We got a lot of laughs out of this binky.  It was a hit! It works like a real pacifier too not just for looks.
Have used these since my baby girl was born and she loves them. And worth mentioning they are also very cute !
This item is adorable!  I love it! i will be purchasing more for sure.  Its super soft, my baby girl loves it!
this worked great. my son sleeps all night with this and loves it. we always had swaddles with our other kids.
we used these at a baby shower to give the mom-to-be handmade personalized bibs for her baby.  she loved them.
great child lock for your door wall!  keeps little kids from opening the door, but is easy for adults to open.
such a cute bank.  a little small and awkward shape to store much money, would be better for change not bills.
i  love the lamp shade but i was expecting the whole lamp.<br />my fault for not reading the description right
so cute will occupy him while soothing him goes with all the other awesome things I have purchase from amazon.
These are so great. Really well made and a perfect way to get the daddy-to-be excited about buying baby items.
this is the best gate i have ever used.  when i put it up it was kind of hard but now that it is up i love it.
Just what I wanted. My baby loves them. Won't use any other. After I bought in pink and purple - just as great
my son loves this! he chews on this forever. it easy to attach to stroller, diaper bag etc. it's easy to wash.
the sheet fits the mattress well. nice color. it is soft to touch and washes well. good quality for the price.
great. you can see the entire inside of the car with this mirror. crystal clear. easy to attach. good product.
Dude, these things really glow bright! They are also a good size, cute, and I love that they glow in the dark.
very good system. i used it to monitor my elderly ill mother. the motion feature assured she would not wander.
My 7 month old loves these pacifiers. I have tried others, but he just spits them out. They get an A+ from me!
these zippy cups don't leak and are easy for little hands to grip. highly recommend these for your little one.
these came quick and were in new and undamaged condition. they are small enough for my newborn and look great!
My 3 month old LOVES this thing. He has to have it with him all the time. It's very easy to clean, very tough.
we bought this for our parents vehicle and it is so easy to install and use with our existing infant car seat.
love the set. adorable and soft. amazing for the price!! can't beat how much you get for how little you pay!!!
These paci's are the best.  Big kahuna loves them and he gets all the chicks with his new handlebar moustache.
Good quality item, indicating brings photo. I highly recommend it, for the price it is a very good bargain =).
I bought this for my nephew and momma was so excited.  It's Definitely worth the money.  Very cute and cuddly!
Don't buy these for your child, MY son won't use anything else, and they are really expensive and hard to find
we were looking to buy my son his first pillow, this is the perfect size and i love that it is hypoallergenic!
Easy to keep up with!  We always have a toy to play with and a soothie when she's sleepy!  Love all wubbanubs!
Calms my baby down right away. It seems a little big for her so I am thinking of also trying the gumdrop ones.
Oh my is this thing cute! And best of all my grandson loves it. And everyone who saw him with it adored it too.
Great price, colors vary but I don't mind. Anything that makes my son stop crying and is BPA free works for me!
Very happy, my baby too.Forget all the fancy ones,this ones are the best.Thank u Amazon for having them for us.
Both my babies love MAM pacifiers!  They are great for newborns and contour to Thayer face for a secure sucking
Sturdy, easy to use, my kids each have had &#34;their&#34; paci chain that we keep long after the paci departs.
this is soooo  nice!  its a quilt,  don't understand why they call it a coverlet?? its perfect for a mini crib!
These are our favorite pacifiers and I will continue to buy them for my own babies as well as gifts for others.
bought as a gift for an upcoming baby shower, but is the same brand i used when my children wore cloth diapers.
fits perfectly on our britax seat and it comes off so easy to clean. i would definitely recommend this product.
if bugaboo had installed these on the initial unit in the first place, we might not have needed to order these.
Shipping was fast. Haven't used them yet but I've heard they are what the hospital gives out and are fantastic.
Very good case for all kinds of pacifier. I'm using it for the Gumdrop and it fits perfectly and keeps it clean
My baby has loved these since he was a newborn.  He doesnt really use it as a pacifier, more as a teething toy.
My son has the monkey its &#34;His Monkey&#34; and he loves it bought this as a gift !!!! hope they love it too
LOVE this pacifier! My grandson is 3 months old and loves it! Wish they had had these when my kids were little!
this is a great crib liner.  it's sturdy enough, yet breathable for my little guy that tosses around all night.
How true it is!  A big hit as an extra little gift at a baby shower!  Gave everyone a laugh.  Plus it's useful!
My grandson thinks it is the most wonderful thing in the world, and gets so excited to have it.  So, I love it!
perfect fit to sit in the back seat, right behind the console - the velcro has also kept it in place perfectly!
My baby doesn't use a pacifier but she uses it to chew on while she's teething. We don't leave home without it!
My baby loves these pacifiers, she used them since birth and is already a year old. Excellent quality and price
Very funny...my nephew loves to walk with this pacifier around and besides it is very hard so it doesn't break.
Very good price! very good quality! I will defenetly recoment it to my friends. I will buy  more in the future!
My daughter loves this! We call it her &#34;best friend&#34; would recommend as a much buy for any young child.
perfect for my three year old. They even glow in the dark which my daughter absolutely just loved it! Good Buy!
I bought it for my brand new nephew and he has never looked more hilarious. I want an extra pair for myself lol
This is the only pacifier my daughter will take. It has give in it unlike other pacifiers so it's more natural.
My baby Grand daugher had a different one that the dog got ahold of so I ordered her this one and she loves it!
These are the best my son loves it. He will not take any others buy this one, it will make you life alot better
cant beat these paci's yes buy these kind they are just<br />the best sort of paci and soft :)<br />always used
love this bag. i also love that the changing table is attached to it. super stylish and fits everything i need!
Its great to be able to get an all natural product with no compromise. These are great and our baby loves them.
I Used the pacifiers on a diaper cake along with the silverware.  They were a nice finishing touch.to the cake.
My Boy Loves His Wubbanub Pacifier, he enjoys the dragon so much, just wish it was easier to clean or sanitize.
My daughter first received one of these in the NICU and we bought some of our own since she liked them so well.
Very great for price. Will accommodate 2-3 wet cloth diapers if needed or a few suits! Great purchase over all!
i bought this for my best friend's baby shower gift. came quickly as promised and box was in perfect condition!
it solved my life time problems where to put all this toys. thanks god someone came up to this idea. i love it.
Just like the ones in the hospital except with a cutout for the nose.  Exactly what our son was looking for :-)
I gave this to my newborn nephew since his mom was always losing his pacifier, now its always there to be found
just as described.  my son-in-law loved it!  large enough to hold a big lunch, but not too big to carry easily.
i love having extra parts it making using the pump that much easier. they fit great and arrived in record time.
Exactly what we got at the hospital,  which was what I was looking for. These are my baby's favorite Pacifiers.
My oldest loves her ellie and hoping the new baby does too.  Provides comfort and security in such a small toy.
love having my grandson read to me, and the plus side he does it and doesnt realize it is helping him in school
was given one of these at hospital baby will take no other kind, was very happy to find these at a great price.
I use for bottle nipples as well perfect for a diaper bag. Safer than using baby wipes. Great product and price
love the fact that the silverware are pba free, and they came with a carrying case! would definitely buy again.
Title states it all.. the baby can hold it and doesn't have the slightest issue.  I would buy more if I had to.
Works great for our 3 months old and I love that they glow so I can find it in the night without using a light.
we love this carrier. baby sits in a more natural position and is easy to get in and out of, even without help.
New born baby all the way to my current 1yr old who still loves the lamb.  I am going to buy more from friends.
This maybe the last one.  But I don't think so.  She loves this type of  pacifier.  Can be washed and or boiled
this car seat is really great. very easy to hook up and my grand daughter looks very comfortable sitting in it.
it took a few trys but once my baby took to it, it was a life saver. i bought a second one for the living room.

This sheep with pacifier is now part of a small flock that graces the headboard of my bed.    I enjoy them very much.
Fast shipment!!! My daughter loves it! Very cute!! Love that its so easy to find at night!! Can't wait to buy more!!!
Brilliant.  By far one of the best items I purchased for my little one.  Practical AND more importantly she loves it!
Pacifiers come with cover, which is great because kids drop stuff and so do parents! Cute colors and stylish designs.
My son loves this product and everyone sees it and wants one too. I have a stash of them saved for baby shower gifts!

As always wubbanub to the rescue. :) My friends newborn loves it. There is no chasing the bike constantly with these!
Adorable sheep! I bought this for my friend for her birthday and she loved it. Soft and cuddly and a nice small size.
My child loves the WubbaNub! Easy to hang on to and cuddle with plus she enjoys playing with it during our car rides.
Philips AVENT  is the only satisfying pacifier for my baby girl.  She does not like any of the other brand pacifiers.
My baby is a big fan of MAM pacifiers! And I love that they glow in the dark because I find them easily in the night!
This a great product for baby. It was shipped fast and reasonably priced well. Baby just loved this item. Thanks, Amy
Very cute styles and good quality pacifier. They are machine washable so very eay to clean for thw inevitable spills.
This was a great gift for my grandson.  He loves these little pacifiers.  At 4 weeks he can push them into his mouth!
just the right size for my baby to hold, and i love that it converts to a toddler sippy cup. super fast shipping too.
this product made it possible for us to put our four-year-old granddaughter in a large queen size bed.  she loves it!
Our friends and family can't stop laughing every time my son uses this pacifier! Double bonus is my son loves it too!
We throw two in her crib when we put her to bed.  And she smiles and waves every time she sees that little pink bear!
I agree with item. The item is accord with my spectates. Thank you for all. I glad with it. The item size is correct.
My son has two Wubbanubs that we love. So I bought this for a friend for her little girl. It is absolutely adorable!!
My daughter love it! I recommend! This is the only pacifier she likes! I pretend buy another like this in the future!
beautiful crib, fairly easy to assemble. promptly arrived on my door step. highly recommend, totally worth the money.
too cute but he won't use any pacifiers.  guess Im grateful for that but would recommend to others or give as a gift.
Great quality, easy to wash. I'm obsessed with Wubbanubs and would purchase one of each if my husband would allow it.
These are by far my granddaughters favorite. She can put them in either way and it doesn't matter. Highly recommend!!
My grandson loves the one he has similar to this.  It makes a great baby gift for a baby that loves his/her pacifier.
great at protecting the seats in our cars. much more durable than most mats i've seen and definitely worth the money.
Our daughter really likes these. We also have the puppy and they have been very handy.  I would purchase these again.
brilla en la oscuridad cuando mas necesitas encontrarlo, tiene un tama帽o ideal y trae tapa, es perfecto para mi bebe.
cute little pink monkey that feels great and matches the rest of the set. hopefully she will like it as much as i do.
Nothing to say just a funny novelty to give to my baby brother. Is hilarious to watch him around the house with it in
haha little baby on the way well this is the perfect binky for the baby! people will laugh and it is just awesome! :)
These are the only pacis my daughter will use and they don't have them anymore in my toys r us or target.  Thank G-d.
This is the ONLY pacifier my one month old son will take. It's spendy for a pacifier but worth it, and it's adorable.
Everything went quick and was very easy....we received the pacifiers very quickly. I would definitely use them again!
My granddaughter loves it. She can hold it to place the pacifier in her mouth----- a great idea. She also has a lamb.
he is a tractor/truck boy and this really made mealtime fun and easy to keep him at the table and focused on the meal
very attractive look, easy to install, my husband installed one so that the gate swings both ways, which was perfect!
Amazing!!! My kid plays with it everyday.  She loves to pull on the string & chew the pacifier holders!! it's great!!
Just as described, best to get a clip to attach to these as they hop all over the floor in which i lost many of them.
looked all over for these bibs, catches the mess nicely and the kids don't mind them on. they are soft but work well.
my son loves this thing! he usually hates tummy time, but he enjoys looking at himself so now he likes tummy time. :)
it really works! my daughter suffer from constipation. i used the windy, and helped her instantly. totally recomended
My nine-month-old loves these. I love them too easy to keep clean. I really like the doctor Brown's line of products.
highly recommend this product to anyone looking for one! arrived in said amount of time a well. thanks and god bless!
sticks well to the corners of my table.  have bumped the corners often with my hip and the edges remain on the table!
this truly is a luxury backseat mirror for the baby.  very high quality, much better than the last one we had bought!
Would never buy any other name in nipples or pacifiers. They are strong, orthodontically correct and clean up easily.
Our young son has been so much more content since we started using these pacifiers. I am placing another order today.
My son wouldn't take any pacifier until I tried the Wubbanub. It definitely soothes him to the point he falls asleep.
Exactly what I was looking for with the waterproof! & exactly what I was expecting from this product! Thanks so much.
My daughter won't sleep without something to hold on to and without a pacifier and this combines it perfectly for her
My daughter loves these pacifiers as well as the Latch bottles everything else would just fall right out of her mouth
thanks... it's perfect.... nice... i reccomend! i hope i can find more items like this one. thank you again we loved!
easy to assemble, only 4 screws to worry about, sturdy, my niece went crazy for it - great product!  would buy again!
great for my 22month old, he loves the bottle the only bad thing is my son bites the nipple and i have to replace it.
Best pacifiers there is out there. My daughter is breast feed and she loves these. Amazing product and easy to clean!
Wubbanubs have been a blessing for us. I can find his pacifier now. No digging in a car seat or losing it in the car.
this cover is really soft, the colors are beautiful and it is a perfect complement for the adorable dino bedding set.
this is a very quiet hand pump, easy to use and put together. very good value for the price.  perfect for travel use.
absolutely beautiful!  my new grandson gets to sleep in style and he is at just the right height for me to get to him!
Love it,  My baby is the cutest when he uses this pacifier!!!  My baby loves it and we make him use it at every chance
Just a nice handy item to have.  Leave it hooked to the outside of our diaper bag for easy access.  Easy to clean too.
love this purchase! very happy!! have been looking for the perfect item and found it! very pleased with this! thanks!!
Adorable and perfect little longhorn Wubanub that is hard to find. A must get for a gift or self with the great price.
We have and will always use the soothies! Our babies have all loved them! Great item at an excellent price. Thank you.
cute little toys. my grandson used to watch them after we would wind them.  great entertainment for infants. thank you
this glider was worth the investment! so comfy and soothes baby! probably the best thing i bought for baby! must have!
my daughter's favorite toy starting at 3 months. the first toy she loved because it was easy for her to get a hold of.
the snack tray is  very cool. 8 year old grandson loved it!  it worked really well for our 10 month old granddaughter!
it helps my baby alot and he likes it so this is a good product to by and it will last a long time for u and your baby
This is so adorable and my niece absolutely loves it. We had to buy her two since she prefers them to other pacifiers.
My son loves this nook. not much else to say other than it does what it's supposed to. It helps my son sleep at night.
My baby boy loves them and the sports are so cute. We got baseball and soccer.  They look great and be uses them a lot
My daughter is 7 months and still uses these over the older ones. (3-6 months) This is the only pacifier she will take
Love it! My little boy takes it everywhere and the stuffed animal gives him something to play with! Recommend for sure
this is the second one i have bought and they both have had a lot of good use and would buy another for a gift anytime
my new granson loves it. Now 3 months old and is easy to hold ,pet and touch. Ordered additional animal to have in car
I got this to late we switched him to a different paci waiting for this to come in mail but it's soo soft and adorable
Still use this type she's 1 yr old  buy lots of them since we tend to misplace them need a back-up at grandmas house!!
These pacifiers are great! My son loves them and it's easy for him to put in and take out of his mouth! Great product!
Bought for my new nephew and its everyone's favorite. Came on time and its just a normal pacifier with a funny saying.
Excellent! Product just as described. Arrived as expected. Will definitely buy more to add to our WubbaNub collection!
Can't be put into the mouth upside down. Both sides are low, so the baby's nose doesn't get blocked like other designs
This came in the mail very fast. It's easy for my 4 mo old to grab, she plays with it. It's cute and everyone loves it
This is my little babies favorite pacifier.  She absolutely loves these things and wont take any other pacifier at all
Wonderful designe and she likes it and oh so much more adorable with it :) love that it doesn't get dirty when dropped
People loved the grillz, and were LOL when they saw it. Baby liked the functionality of the soother. Must have for fun
My son doesn't like any of the soother, this one? He likes the monkey, and he keeps biting it! As long as he likes it!
they work as designed and stop my son from ruining the back of the seat in front of him while sitting in his car seat.
i recommend this item for any parents, easy to clean and sterilize, it is very strong and confortable for your babies.
purchase it for our daughter, she decorated her new baby's room with it.  good quality she said.  she really likes it.
a great addition to my grand daughter's the very hungry caterpillar- themed nursery. looks well made and safe. luv it!
babycomfynosenreally is so much better than the bulb aspirators. don't over do it but otherwise it's great at its job.
Our granddaughter has long outgrown these, and I forgot to write a review, but this was a great product that we loved.
perfect size and shape for a changing pad  the strap kinda gets in the way  and you will more than likely never use it
My aunt and uncles favorite team so I thought it might be a good idea to get it for the baby boy that I can't wait for
We have a few these for our son(different designs obviously) and got this for our niece...i'm sure she'll love it too!
These are the best bottles ever. Easy to clean, the bottom can be taken apart for deep clean. This is a very nice set.
He loved these when he was using a nub. they are supper easy to find when they fall out of his eye sight. perfect gift
He loved these when he was using a nub. they are supper easy to find when they fall out of his eye sight. perfect gift
My daughter never wanted to use a pacifier, not to bite, now this new release, I like very much, given much attention.
i like it because it  has a contemporary look ,  you can placed it anywhere in your home and brings out a lively look.
super duper cute.  my little girl is going to love it at christmas.  if i know her, she'll be wearing it all the time.
the lanolin really does come off onto your nips and helps with soreness. they are worth more $$ than the regular ones.
i bought the lion and the bull and our grandson loves them. they are his favorite. great idea, very well made..perfect
Used for all three kids. No problems. We bought age specific ones as they aged. We trusted them because of the design.
the little girl this went to loves it.  very colorful, and made very well.  i think there will be years of enjoyment..
My daughter loves this kitty! It arrived in good shape and is a well made stuffed toy. I would recommend it to anyone.
Love Wubba Nubs, love this elephant version.  Very soft and cute! We always get compliments when out and about with it.
My baby is almost 4 months old and absolutely loves it..its easy for her to hold onto and it goes everywhere with us...
i love this nightlight.  bought one for my grandson two years ago and just bought one for a friend.  it's a great gift.
This pacifier was absolutely adorable one of my favorites as well as my nieces favorite and it made it here in two days
Haven't used it yet, but it is a nice size and looks nice hanging on my jj cole satchel diaper bag. Quality seems good.
These pacifiers are GREAT!  They go the distance!!  You can wash them in the dishwasher, or in the sink--they hold up!!
I used this in the bottom of hit Pack n Play and all of the sudden my son wi actually sleep in there! This works great!
Great product for babies, particularly those who need a pacifier, but haven't mastered keeping it in their mouthes yet.
Great idea to make mom and others laugh and a plus for the baby. Why? Because he will recieve more attention of course!
used it for my first daughter and now the second one also loves it. goes to sleep right away as soon as rocking starts.
I have tried Dr.Brown's pacifier and he hates it. Now after my doctor's recommendation I got this and my baby loves it.
Purchased for an added gift for the male boss as his wife is having baby!  Perfect gift that is cute, useful and funny!
Cool gift.Bought for a shower gift for my son.He will love it! Cant wait for him to see it.Funny! Baby will look great!
I've heard great things about these pacifiers. I bought 6 for my cousin's first baby. The come in 3 packages of 2 each.
very helpful in between feeding , colors very appealing for our little one, proper shape and satisfying to baby. thanks
Baby and mother loved this product..worked great..just remember if you have a dog he will love the smell to and eat it.
wonderful!if you like keeping it fresh than this is the product for you or you happy green stuff. stay happy san diego.
love it! my lo don't like anything under the the head. but she likes this one. still waiting for head to stay in shape.
Love these!  It makes them so easy to find in the middle of the night.  Thank you MAM for making such amazing products.
My grand daughter loves this pacifier, it really cute you can't loose it with the animal on there.  Good item for kids.
Have used these for all three of our boys.  For some reason they seem to be able to keep it in their mouths more easily
I could not find monkey's in any store so they were great ! I can't wait to buy the green set next with clowns on them.
Our baby will never have teeth like these. Nevertheless, it was hilarious to see on him and folks thought it was funny.
the wubbanubs are amazing! they truly calm your child and give them something soft for comfort other than just a binky.
Avent is the brand I have used with my two kids, the third is on the way and I didn麓t doubt keeping working with Avent.
Love this brand, it's my girls' favorite.  Thanks for offering it and shipping it out so quickly, really appreciate it.
Great! My baby loves it. It sounds exactly like the womb. My baby sleep throughout the whole night, and during the day!
Baby loves this turtle and so do we.....no more lost pacifier! Very soft and well made. I would highly  recommend this!
The ONLY pacifiers my baby girl will take. So glad I found these. I am purchasing more right after I write this review!
Awesome! Kids love  these, just wish I could remove the plush pet from the pacifier to wash it... Otherwise it's great.
The Nuk is the only pacifier my son likes - he didn't like the fancier and more expensive ones. And the price is great!
tried many pacifiers, and this one was the only one that stuck until the baby was 卤5mo. highly recommended for newborn.
Grand baby loved it.  Will be buying more....Fast shipping very pleased just perfect , cleans easy very soft right size
i order this because it is BPA free , not some other products that are not BPA free,<br />shipped faster than expected.
my baby loves these spoons and its short enough that he can pretend to feed himself without choking himself right away.
Bought moustachifiers for all baby boys we know, super cute great little gift.  Tried all 3 versions and all very cute.
Really cute.  Baby loves it, great for pictures and you'll get lots of comments when your baby is &#34;plugged in&#34;!
Everything was just like it was described.  In package, it was unopened, as described and was unused as described also.
fantastic!!! he's a tall kid and pulls himself up on everything but this still contains him! i love the gate piece too!
this blanket was more than i expected it was thick and nice and just what i needed for my baby while traveling g thanks
so far love this stroller!  its definitely heavy to carry, but its a smooth ride for the kids! im very happy with this!
These are cute and good quality, but quite heavy. They work for my 9 month old and may be too heavy for a younger baby.
Philips AVENT BPA Free Soothie Pacifier, Green, 3+ Months, 6 pack .Three sets of two pacifiers, 6 green soothies total.
This is a really cute idea for a pacifier--have seen other animals but only saw the dragon online--was thrilled with it
My grand-daughters like the soft pacifier. Even now, 10 months they prefere it and chew on them happily! Good purchase!
baby loves it. good loud rattle. i wish the colors were brighter/more vibrant, but thats not a deal breaker in any way.
I love the WubbaNubs in general. Helps the pacifier stay closer to my baby's mouth and he likes to touch the plush toy.
very excited to get this bank for our little girls room. can't wait until she finally makes her arrival into the world!
My granddaughter absolutely LOVES her wubbanub.  And it helps us keep track of her pacy.  We absolutely LOVE THIS ITEM!
Convenient it closes before it touches any surface.<br />Price is great for the quality.<br />I believe is a must have.
Always have loved these pacis. Same ones as the little babe gets at the hospital so there isn't any confusion for them!
this mattress pad cover came quickly and was exactly what i needed to store my son's crib mattress until the next baby.
very nice look and fits perfect the quinny modd stroller. easy to use and not so heavy as thought. totally recommended.
We love it! Makes paci easy to find. My 1 month old wraps his arm around it while he sucks. Helps keep it in his mouth.
my girlfriend calls this the mircale baby carrier and it totally is!!!  love it lots!  highly recommend for all babies!
My niece is teething and she loves this pacifier.  She is a little doll and the Hello Kitty design suits her very well.
The limited edition WubbaNub set is great - so cute!  So glad to find them on amazon - have'nt seen them anywhere else.
Very cute.  Ear handles!  Five month old grandson loves WubbaNubs. We have two.  Very colorful and cute for little one.
Tried this one out first before buying multiples for our son.  He loves it. So we bought the giraffe and the puppy too!
these cups are great, though i failed to notice they are not the insulated ones. no worry though, the girls don't mind.
easy to put on crib and saved our crib from multiple teething marks.  washable and easy to take on and off when needed.
it's awesome!! never seen anything like it and my daughter loves it!! great item i recommend it. it's worth every penny
was a gift for a chef's newborn and she loved it!<br />very cute and well-made! could also work as a halloween costume!
Purchased this for my sister's shower and everyone loved this game. We had a lot of fun. Glad I decided to purchase it.
This was THE pacifier for my son.  We couldn't go anywhere without it, it was his #1 necessity.  No other paci would do.
WOW!! WHAT A FANTASTIC IDEA TO HAVE A SOFT TEDDY WITH A PACIFER, THEY ARE THE PERFECT SIZE & COLOR. MY BABY LOVE'S THEM!
These pacifiers are so cute and perfect for your little princess!  I can't wait until mine arrives and gets to use them!
i love how many toys this net holds! we probably have 40 stuffed animals hanging in this net. easy and quick to install.
We have several of these! My month old loves them and so do I because they're easy for him to find and put in his mouth.
i felt better having this faucet cover installed when my daughter started to stand up in the tub. super easy to install.
my baby loves this toy bar.  the bjorn banysitter balance is my favorite baby item and the toy bar makes it even better.
looks great, doesnt slide, easy to clean and superior slip proofing for any ages. much better than those tacky stickers.
really love this bag, when i show it to my baby girl, she simply loved it so much. attempt to carry it around the house.
Love these pacifiers.  I only wish I could get my baby to stop taking a pacifier, but the sport theme is nice for a boy.
My newborn baby loves this pacifier at the hospital-he even uses his hand to hold it in place.  So I am buying two more.
Love these for the little guy. Have about 1 dozen around the house and have been buying them for our parents houses now.
Great pacifier, my new born loved it and this was the only one that worked. After 8 months we no longer needed anything.
easy and light to carry around anywhere. fits in my wallet. love that i can throw them out and my baby is still so clean
Great product! My 3 month old liked this style better than a few of the other styles out there. I will be ordering more!
very nice item- definitely a cut above cheap pacifiers- natural materials make a huge difference. my baby girl likes it.
Tried several others.  A friend recommended these.  This is the only pacifier my son would except when he was a newborn.
This pacifier was everything we expected!  I love the way the baby can hold it and is comforted. We highly recommend it.
He cant sleep without these! We have purchased 3 of these so far! Very satisfied the tricky part will be taking it away!
i needed a to clean inside bottle and it cheap and dose the job<br />buy it  if you need something simple to do the job.
cute and lightweight. my son really likes wearing this. he has only worn it a few times but so far, it has held up well.
i know this set is meant for kids, but i bought them for movie snack time. the smaller size will help in portion sizing.
Love em to death !! My son keeps the TIDE ROLLING! I just might order another set but that would entitle another kid lol
she's really into paci's and these are very good.  happy with the purchase and have no complaints.  thank you very much.
As NICU nurse I can heartily recommend the Wubbanubs. As a grandmother I even more heartily recommend. One is not enough
My grandbabies love this!  It's a nice size/shape to hold and they can get the pacifier into their mouths pretty easily.
very satisfied with this item. bright, colorful & easy to apply. my son loves it & adds color to my walls without paint.
We love MAM pacis, they are the best brand in my opinion. These ones are so cute too, and the price was very affordable.
this works great for bottles and other small opening containers! i like its stand for by the sink so it can dry off too!
arrived on time and it is very roomy! looks well built and the stitching is clean! exactly what you see is what you get.
baby preferred cloth ones.  grandma likes these.  i do not like being told to use an exact number of words in my review.
similar to an italian made chico pram we had more than 10 years ago, everything looks great and we love the flexibility.
Those pacifiers are amazing ,<br />I have been buying them for all kid who I know.<br />Highly recommend,<br />Thank you
Daddy wanted these binkies for his baby boy, but fortunately baby boy didn't like these binkies. But they are very cute.
My baby loves these. Good price on this product. Same product you find in stores cheaper. Would purchase again and again
My 3 month old son absolutely adores his wubbanub. The first color infants see is red, which is why I chose this one. :)
i purchased this for my daughter and her husband who are expecting their first child (my 1st grandchild!). they love it!
Baby likes them. They are not vanilla scented like the ones she loved in the hospital but she still likes them the same.
both of my grandson's have this and what a great product.  it uses minimal water and yet the baby feels warm and secure.
The babe loves the bottles and the pacifier matches the bottle nipples perfectly. Happy baby, happy Mommy, happy family!
this gives us great piece of mind! we sleep so much better now that we have the snuza! this is my favorite baby product!
Love it! My Baby girl especially loves on her crib. Very soft, easy to grab and put I her own mouth. Very pretty colors.
this costume was chosen because it didnot have feet in it...so child could not fall over the shoe covers.  cute costume.
Great product and perfect for little guys trying to learn to reach and hold on to colorful objects! He loves it! Thanks!
Worked very well!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Now I carry her everywhere with me thanks to this extension. I have hands free now! Yay
have also other wide nipples (dr brown, avent, etc) but found this will not fit dr brown, but do 'kinda' work on avent--
Fits my babys mouth perfectely! my baby sucks on it a lot and these are the ones you need because they are very durable!
I ordered this for my first grand daughter. Mahra took a liking to it quick. This is the one she prefer over the others.
These are the only pacifiers my baby likes the feel of AND can't rip apart! I tried like every other kind under the sun!
i bought this for my graco pack n play.  it fits well over the mattress that came with the pack n play and is very soft.
My infant loves it!! It washes wonderfully in the washing machine :-) Well worth the money! You will not be disappointed!
perfect for a sandwich and some snacks!  easy to open velcro for little fingers.  easy to wash (just flip it inside/out).
Go to the dreambaby website to make sure you purchase the correct sizes.  These are sturdy and go perfect with the gates.
on time and the quality of product is excellent and the price is the lowest on the market. i would tell a friend. thanks!
This pacifier attacher is great. It is much nicer than the fabric ones and I love the skulls :) Perfect for your bad boy.
Best deal I've found out there for binkies. Especially since we usually lose one or two a day, its nice to have back ups.
This product was delivered exactly as I expected. I am very happy with this item and look forward to giving it as a gift.
my son loves this bottle. i purchased this bottle mainly for traveling, to keep his milk cold. i would recommend to buy !
After trying numerous other brands, this is the only one my dd would use. They are also cute & come with a carrying case.
my granddaughter loves sleeping with this soft cozy &#34;rub it&#34; that we call them here.  perfect size for a newborn.
These are the only pacifiers my son will accept. He can keep hold of them with much ease and they are shaped more natural
These are wonderful for allowing both parent and baby to find the paci during the middle of the night - highly recommend.
Not only are the Wubbanubs super cute, my son can easily find it in the middle of the night without waking up the family!
great idea my daughter was having problem with potty training till we got this watch now she goes every time it goes off.
MAM brand is what was preferred by all three of my babies, these pink newborn ones are both adorable and perfectly sized.
Love this pacifier!  Easy to clean. We just toss in the wash and it dries quickly. My daughter loves chewing on the ears.
My son loves this.  Much easier for baby to grasp than just a pacifier.  And it can go in the sterilizer, which is great.
we had a resistant learner.  this was the only thing that made him feel comfortable.  it was comfortable and didn't leak.
it covers everything (even for my very active son), plus i easily installed it with one hand on the first try. love it!!!
Great for breastfed babies. Helps them not to develop bad latching techniques compared to orthodontic and flat pacifiers.
This was a gift but I have seen first hand that babies love these things!  Cant go wrong with anything longhorn themed :)
purchased for my newborn photo shoots and they are perfect. someone recommended them to me and i'm glad i purchased them.
Gift to expecting mother who is doing giraffe theme.  She loved it.  It was exactly what she wanted and was very pleased.
This was a gift I bought for a baby shower. I have Wubbanub's for my daughter and she loves them. They are easy to clean.
It is very funny to see my nephew walking around with this pacifier, he loves it and it doesn't break when it falls down.
We're getting ready to move to Texas, so it seemed only fitting to get our daughter the Longhorn Bull! We LOVE Wubbanubs!
I love this pod, it is the Perfect size, easy to clean and beautiful print. 1-2 pacifiers fit perfectly. I recommend it !
You can sterilize this bottle without a sterilizer, it's really easy to clean, the pacifiers are cute, the price is good.
We had various reasons to use a pacifier very early on in my baby's life. We never had nipple confusion using this brand.
My 10 month old loves the MAM pacifiers! She especially loves chewing on the silicone sides. I definitely recommend them.
i have not used it yet, but considering the regular bottles, i'm pretty sure i'll like it also.<br />a satisfied grandma!
I bought this as a gift for a friend who recently had a baby boy and it did not disappoint!  It's adorable and hilarious!
i bought this as a baby shower gift for a friend who had a mustache themed baby shower for her baby boy. definitely cute!
This pacifier was the only one accepted by my bb since he was 2 weeks old. Ans still he takes it. (Now he is 6 weeks old)
They come in a nice clear case, so it's perfect for a baby shower gift! They're adorable! Arrived on time with no issues.
Of all the pacifiers I bought, my daughter only liked this one. It's also very easy to wash, just throw it in the washer!
My doula recommended these and we love them. We have ordered several more including glow in the dark ones!!  A great buy.
Our son has had his Pandu for 5 years (without the pacifier of course!) and it's become his lovey and part of the family.
shipping was super fast and my son is so fascinated by his mobile now! the fast music isnt a problem. im extremely happy.
really easy to use and equally easy to clean.<br /><br />note: don't suck to hard otherwise you'll have a squealing babe.
I bought this item for my sister's baby shower.  Mustachifiers are so cute, BPA free, and make great conversation pieces.
These glow in the dark for quite some time. Can't give you an exact. It's great when trying to get them down at night. :)
the story, the colors, the crinkly flaps - it all works. keeps my little girl entertained and that's all i could ask for.
it came quickly and looked exactly like the picture. the tubing fit and it was cheaper than ordering directly from medela
sophie is the teething choice in our family. a real winner with all the grandchildren. great toy even for just play time.
This is a great accurate product.  I was skeptical at first but I am now a believer.  So easy even a cave man can use it!
My toddler seems very happy with the AVENT pacifiers. Somehow, the price seems more reasonable than the other AVENT ones.
perfect for newborn, easy to put on, better than using wraps, good quality, will probably last till she is 3-4 months old
this is one of the greatest ways to save a child knees. what a perfect invention to create for a new started of crawling.
really happy. these are so cute and will be great with the tutu i purchased.nice material.i think they will hold up well.
Cute addition to the many &#34;binkies&#34; already being used.  It was Hello Kitty so I just couldn't resist getting it.
Can't say enough about these pacifiers! They have been a life saver! My daughter prefers this pacifier over other brands.
He wont take a regular passy anymore once he started using these. would highly recommend for all newborns. Bite price tho
I love these New York Yankees pacifiers. They will be perfect for my newborn grandson. My daughter loves them. Thank you.
The only pacifier my baby will take.  Worth the investment. My baby is breastfed and hates bottles but he loves this paci
very soft and fits my changing pad perfectly.  this changing pad also washes well without shrinkage or pilling of fabric.
My son loves these pacifiers, he wont use any other kind!  Im so happy Amazon is selling these.  Great price, Great value
Just what I was looking for good quality and priced right. Shipped very fast too. Great to put in with other sports stuff
What a cute product.  These are great if your child uses a pacifier.  Makes it easier to locates with an animal attached.
Hard to say who enjoys it more, grandma or the grand baby...I guess the grand baby.Good quality item with a great design.
My daughter and granddaughter love this pacifier.  It is easily washed in the washing machine.  Does not get lost easily.
It's a good buy to get your infant started off in the right direction. I've had no problems with it and neither has my son
it is easy to assemble .safe,comfortable,high quality .i love this stroller ,my little one loves it too.first gift for her
i gave this as a shower gift and the parents say they can't do without it. easy to use and easy to get the baby in and out
Got it for my preemie grandson. Elephant lays on his chest and helps to keep pacifier in his mouth. Plus I love elephants.
bought this as a gift for good friends of ours. they loved the frame. it's pretty, and looks nice. hope this review helps!
This Pacifier is fashion,very beautiful,I  feel my duaghter like it very much,I feel<br />I love it ,so.you should buy it,
the wearable blanket is very nice, the fabric is cotton and breathable, my baby is very confortable while sleeping inside.
I m very pleased with this, in turtle theme baby gift basket.  Can't speak as to actual use but I am pleased with quality.
Of the three wubbas I have purchased (paci eating dog), the elephant is the best.  It's ears are easy for a baby to grasp.
The only paci my 1 month old babies can (kind of) keep in their mouths for more than 2 seconds... And it's natural... Win!
the product came to me well and on time, without any problem, i'm already using and it works perfectly, totally recommend.
just like the soothie you get in the hospital but great unique color! love it! Serems strong and durable and long lasting!
I bought this for my newest nephew, knowing my oldest nephew adored his, and had quite the collection, so far he loves it!
i bought 12 month and now 18 month size for my son. machine washed multiple times; the fabric/ colors held up pretty good.
Wubanub is amazing! I bought one more for my kid and three for shower gifts. He can now hold onto it and teeth on the feet
My 7 month old uses this as a teether. He is exclusively breastfed and does not use it to suck but he loves it to chew on.
Can't wait to see a little baby with this in their mouth. It looks just like the picture and it will be a fun shower gift.
Perfect. Quick shipment. Product just as described. If you intend to use a pacifier for your baby these are a must have!!!
This wall decal is amazing! it was soooo easy to put up and looks very nice... I am getting more of these for other rooms.
These were the same as the ones the hospital issued, only in pink. That is what I wanted, that is what they sent. Perfect.
wubbanubs are the only paci my baby likes.  The elephant is super cute and his big ears are easy for a young baby to hold.
Love wubbanub.  These are so cute and a super great value for 3.  Love the different kinds of animals I can order on line.
So cute!! A little bit difficult with the newborn to keep it in their mouth but with a little bit older baby it's perfect!
Love these pacifiers! They have been a lifesaver for us since day 1 and after 4 months of use they are still going strong.
These glow nicely all night making them easy to find. I like that they also come with a box for storage and sterilization.
these are the best sippy cups i have found. the twist on easily. don't have trouble leaking. bpa free and dishwasher safe!
what can i say it a must have with car seats, this product it as good as what you could purchase at a store. i works well.
Who doesn't love a Bad Ass Baby? This is super cute! I recommend it for all babies. Babies shouldnt be limited to pastels.
My wife loves it :p and I think it's really fun and playfull like how babies often are. I don't see anything wrong with it
I should have held off on purchasing since the hospital will give me a pacifier but I see a whole lot of babies using this
great quality, plenty of options for sound and volume. projector is great and holds extra options for projection pictures.
the product came to me well and on time, without any problem, i'm already using and it works perfectly, totally recommend.
My daughter holds the owl in her little hands so the binky stays in her little mouth. Genius! It's a must in our baby bag.
My 2 month old loves these! She can touch and hold the plush while using and they are much easier for mom to keep up with.
Seemed to be a good product - bought as a gift for an Angel Tree in our church.  Product seemed to be exactly as promised.
LOVE IT!!!!! My only complaint is that it doesn't have a paci cover...but still bought a couple of them and baby loves it!
Got the first one at the hospital where my baby was born and she loves it.  Easy to clean and safe. I highly recommend it.
Fast ship, great price on this pacifier! I was looking for something different for a baby shower and this went over great!
We love wubbanubs! My son has never used anything put these since the day he was born. They are very durable and washable.
this is the perfect transition to a big chair. the booster is very cozy (hence the name) and does not slide on our chairs.
i got this for the kolcraft cozy crib mattress.  not only does it wash up terrific, but you couldn't ask for a better fit!
These are fantastic. My baby was given one at the hospital and now she won't use any other pacifier. She loves this thing.
Very cute! Gender neutral and easy to locate in the dark - as opposed to the clear ones. This is baby's favorite pacifier.
Newborn loved sucking this one. She did keep other more expensive brands in her mouth. Baby was the judge of this product.
i really like this product. its is very soft and easy to wash. it fits great on the pad! i am very happy with my purchase.
best mirror! large enough to be able to see baby clearly. easy to adjust. doesn't distort the image like others out there.
This is cute and my great grandson's mother loved it.  The skull isn't too big or scary and the nipple is the right shape.
My kiddo was supa' cute! This product is worth it for the laughs. He has enjoyed playing with it beyond Halloween as well.
product works great when putting new born in a swing. supports the head very nice. it is also a great value for the price.
these were very soft and a nice material that wont sleep too hot!  best pj's i've bought so far!  they are super adorable!
my daughter loves these rings. we took them apart & made numerous rings w/ just 2-3 rings each. she loves to chew on them.
i love the sippigrip. it keeps the sippy cups and toys off the floor and in the stroller. perfect for my 1 year old twins!
These are the only pacifiers my son will use! For that reason they are a lifesaver, and for THAT reason, they get 5 stars.
A gift for our new grandson, hope it keeps him quiet, I mean happy!  Anyway, my son was happy with it for his little tyke.
these covers are great. they take up no space at all in your pocket and completely cover the potty on the sides and front.
My baby loves this. It helps her sleep. I love how the lamb is attached to it. It helps her keep the pacifier in her mouth
My son loves this, it's his favorite pacifier! I will be buying more of these. Everyone that sees it thinks it's so cute!!
Pros: Natural, stays in well, easy to keep clean, no nipple confusion<br />Cons: expensive, bounce a long way when dropped
This is now the 2nd wubbanub i've purchased for my baby nience and she just can't get enough of them. Highly recommend it!
love this product. it goes so well with my baby's room. very happy with this purchase. i recommend purchasing this product.
My little girl loves this thing! I even bought the elephant one for her and ordered one for a friends baby! Great product!!
it' is so beatiful and good quality. my first baby like this bumper(she have good sleep). i recommend this item. thank you.
just like the one that came with the car seat. i've had this for about a month and love no more car swapping with the base!
Love these pacifiers! My baby loves them too. They're lightweight so they don't fall out easily and they have cute designs.
Super cute to see my daughters mouth glowing as I rock her to sleep. They don't glow for very long but its a great concept.
My daughter in law is nursing and says this pacifier is most like &#34;mom&#34;. So my grand daughter is willing to use it.
My daughter loves hers! She will not sleep without or take a regular soothie anymore. I had to order a few more for back up
The color and design is great comes in handy for a crying baby and was made with good quality. Will for sure purchase again
baby likes this wubba, and its a good shape for him to grasp and hold onto. It washes easily and came packaged as expected.
love these pacifiers as they are nuk and are hello kitty and priced comparably to CVS (except I can't get these at my CVS).
we love these pacifiers.  Can never have enough of them.  The six pack makes it a little easier to always have a clean one.
Great product!馃憤 this product will save you lots of money. You will be able to keep up with pacifiers . I highly recommend.
my daughter's must have.  She has to have 2 at a time.  one in her hand and one in her mouth.  price is cheaper than stores
These pacifiers are wonderful. Our baby holds them and cuddles them. They are expensive, but we'll made and worth the cost.
This is the only binky my grandson will use, we love it. It,s also durable<br />Like the idea of two binkies in the package
this is the perfect size for little hands. the baby loves to grasp it and shake it. great colors that keep baby interested.
Big hit at my daughters baby shower!! Great quality, haven't used them yet since the baby isn't born...hope she likes them.
Shop for my friends. She told me that her baby loves this. I think the baby likes it which shows the product is a good one.
Great quality and my granddaughter likes these very much. We also use the Mam bottles and this brand last a very long time.
a little pricey but my son would only use this kind whenever he got a bottle, since he doesn't get a bottle very regularly.
My grandson loves his dino pacifier.  He is 2 months old and is calmed by the pacifier and likes to hold the soft dinosaur.
just what I wanted to give.I am sure the new parents will love it, because pacifiers are always dropping from their mouths.
This pacifier is the closest I could find to the ones they send home from the hospital!!! Great price! I loved the quality.
I got this for two of my friends who were expecting and their babies LOVE it.  It's the best little gift for a baby shower.
cute gift idea along with other items. The recipient liked it very much. Went very well with other gifts with cute sayings.
My granddaughter loves it. Love it. This is exactly what I was looking for. I am sure it will serve me well for many years.
just the way the product was described. i am a wedding planner, and i was really happy with the purchase.<br />recommended.
these are exactly what i wanted.  they fit my 8 month old and 2 year old.  very easy to clean and quick to dry.  love them!
Love these for newborns.  They are the perfect size and they have a better shape than the hospital provided soothie paci's.
my poor baby is cutting 4 teeth on top; this teether really helps with the soreness in her gums. it's her favorite, by far.
my daughter absolutely loves her wubba nubs an she was delighted to recieve ella bella the pink elephant adorable wubba nub
My granddaughter loves her 'Ellie'.  She also has a lamb 'Lucy' and her green frog 'Fred'.  Very comforting for her and us!
This is an excellent product, at a very good price. I had looked all over for the newborn size.  It was just what I wanted!
Not sure what we would do without them. The store bought pacifiers just do not cut it with him, he loves these ones though.
What can I say? I don't know what I'd do without these binkies. We have about 10 of them because we are always losing them!
We won't use another binky. This is the only one that my daughter, will take and she loves them. I love the design as well!
Wonderful match for our nursery. It is sturdy, functional and so cute. I was also very pleased with the shipping packaging.
My son wouldn't accept any other pacifier and I couldn't find them in another other store. I had to stock up!! LOVE THESE!!
This is the only pacifier that my little girl will take. Not only is it drop dead adorable, but she loves the nipple on it!
My daughter loves wubbanubs!  Although she is not on the paci anymore she still likes to play with the stuffed animal part.
fit my graco pack and play just like a glove.  would buy this again if it wears out before i'm done with the pack and play.
Bought this for my must have everything Giraffe daughter.  She displays it prodly will all her other Giraffe paraphernalia.
Easy tool to use; my granddaughter cooperated very well with the non contact method. Recommend highly to other families now
When someone won't stop complaining about Wes Welker leaving the Pats for Denver, this is the cutest way to make them STFU.
My baby started with wubba nub at birth. She learned how to grasp the doll part early on. She loves it! It's a must have!!!
great gate. bought additional eyelets so we can use the gate where ever our grand children are playing. plan to buy another
i like it! a retard can snap the lock on the strap together my baby fits in it well and i have not had a problem as of yet!
I wish they would have been pink but they are so cute and we just love them. It made a nice stocking stuffer for Christmas.
when i took the childb out of his jumperoo, heb screamed sound loud it was just like dragging an alcoholic  outbid a bar!!!
Great product! We never lose this pacifier! It also helps keep the pacifier in my daughters mouth safely!! Would buy again!
This was a fun, out-of-the-norm, but useful item.  My friend loves it for her little boy, and said it was well-constructed.
I purchased this for a baby shower gift.  It is SOoo cute!  Also, quick delivery.  Soft and seems to have good construction.
Super cheap for two pacifiers! And it was the exact type that the hospital gave us so we have back up if we were to lose it.
This review is really on behalf of my babies because we have tried different ones but both would only use Soothie pacifiers.
My husband the dentist was skeptical of pacifiers because of teeth problems, but he is fine with these, and they work great!
very cute and durable! his singing and movement is very entertaining and loud enough to lead the birthday song at the party.
this extension kit makes your playyard bigger and better!  our child has more room to play without feeling as much confined.
My baby loves the bottles and they are easy to clean and fill.  The numbers on the side are readable even when full of milk.
exactly what i needed, at a better price than buying medela brand. same quality, works perfectly. amazon comes though again!
my granddaughter is finally able to sleep more than 15 minutes because of the slight incline. thank goodness!! try it soon!!
my new great grandson love's it. the heart beat sound put him to sleep at night.<br />the mother thinks it is the best!!!!!!
Absolutely love this pacifier my sons favorite bedtime companion many compliments on this one. Very easy to find at nightime
Works as a great soother for my seven month old. He's been breast fed since birth and this is the only pacifier he will use.
quick arrival.  the packaging could have been better, but the product works great and as expected.  good purchase for sure!!
Excellent quality, highly recommended as the best choice for toddlers.  Tried & tested over 3 children so far, soon to be 4.
I am very pleased that I got exactly what I ordered...not badly priced and very fast delivery. Definitely be ordering again.
best highchair. i searched for weeks and finally landed on this graco chair. it is comfortable for my son and easy to clean.
Love these!  They're great to have on hand when you're out somewhere and baby drops the pacifier!  We use them all the time.
I love these pacifiers my daugher loves them. I love the fact that they are one piece and they are made from natural rubber.
got this as an additional baby shower gift for a friend. I, myself, love it. would def get my baby one when that time comes!
Love these Dummies, you can see your little one sucking!<br />Life saver for any new mum!<br />Great colours to choose from!
Used it since day one, it helps at nights he falls sleep with the soothie its my life saver and we will definitely buy more.
This is a great product for kids! They are able to hold it and find it in the night! More rested nights for mommy and daddy!
This product works just as advertised.  Good build quality.  I would buy this product  again.  I highly recommend to others.
i bought this for my 5 year-old grandson for when he sleeps at my house and it works great.  i would recommend it to anyone.
bought this for my daughter & her 1st child. super cute idea ~ seems easier to keep up with than a baby book. good purchase!
You can't loose the pacifier and my baby loves it. cutest thing anyone came up with. This is the third one I have purchased.
this was a gift for my grandson. it was on a wish list. his parents like to read to him. he also has a captain calamary toy.
Adorable pacifier. My daughter loves these. About 5 inches long. Perfect for little hands. Wish pacifier was interchangeable
love this bag! perfect for lugging around the basics for my two toddlers. my husband appreciates that it's gender neutral :)
Purchased this as a gift for a soon-to-be-mom relative. It is so cute, I'm sure she will love it. Arrived in very good time.
does what it's supposed to do.  son loves it.  helps him with his gerd and in regulating his feedings.  thank you very much.
we bought this while traveling to my in-laws - it's not good for a full-time high chair but it did the trick while traveling
My son has always loved the paci he got from the hospital. And so we're thrilled that it's available in store and on Amazon.
these little clothes are perfect in the baby wipe warmer. not too big, thicker than the spa silk clothes and wash up nicely.
My daughter absolutely loves these.  It's great to have multiples on hand so one can be chilling while she chews on another.
same exact as the pink/purple/blue/green ones found at walmart and target. never seen the yellow ones so we had to get them!
I ordered for my great grand daughter because she likes monkeys-easy to keep up with pacifier because she likes to throw it-
My grandson has 2 of the WubbaNub pacifiers and he loves to fondle the soft animal as he comforts himself with the pacifier.
My child would only take soothies but they bounced and rolled so we were always searching for one these land and don't roll!
I BOUGHT THIS PACIFIER AS A GIFT FOR SEVERAL PEOPLE. IT WORKS AS REPRESENTED AND IS A GREAT GIFT FOR ANYONE WITH A NEW BABY.
I BOUGHT THIS PACIFIER AS A GIFT FOR SEVERAL PEOPLE. IT WORKS AS REPRESENTED AND IS A GREAT GIFT FOR ANYONE WITH A NEW BABY.
My baby used this kind since the hospital sent it home with us.  They began cracking at 7mo. so I got more.  He loves them!!
this play yard works very well as a protective barrier and i highly recommend it.  we use it to guard around our fireplaces.
We've tried several pacifiers, and these are the best for staying put in my daughter's mouth.  They're her favorite, too :).
Surprised our daughter-in-law at her baby shower. She used the skull in a lot of her decorating, so this was a fitting gift.
i have tried at least 4 other pacis and my daughter only likes this one. i don't know what it is about it, but she loves it.
it' s a really great blanket.  it' breathable and warm at the same time.  it's also big and soft and withheld many washings.
pillow was great while pregnant and is still being used after baby!  makes sleeping very comfortable.  my daughter loved it.
The handle of this box is very convenient. I can hook it on my bag or the baby's bag. Also a good pass time toy for the baby
Happy I found these pacifiers. I had been looking around for awhile. Happy the baby will be matching with his brown outfits!
came as described, i can not complain about anything.  it works well with my medela pump and attaches to the model i bought.
Got this for my friend who was expecting and she absolutely loved it. It looks about the right size and exactly as pictured.
MY BABY & I LOVE THESE MUST HAVE. KINDA PRICY BUT A NICE PRODUCT. MY BABY LIKES THE TASTE LOL WOULD BUY AGAIN WILL RECOMMEND!
This is one team my fiancee and I can agree on. We don't have a baby yet but wanted to make sure we got the deal on them now.
this is super cute and soft the boppy i had came with a boy theme so i was really happy to get a girly theme for my daughter.
my daughter loved this chew toy when she first started teething. it was easy for her to hold. now she loves the large sophie.
works exactly how its described. mashing veges and fruits is easier...saves time and efforts. would recommend to new mums :-)
My daughter loved this paci as an infant and when she started teething it helped her a lot. It is a teether and and a paci :)
my baby like it, it works good to me and my baby, however the temputure does not seems much different between child and adult
love these bibs! very high quality and gorgeous colors! i hate that most other bibs out there have velcro. these are perfect!
My son loves these pacifiers, wont use any other... Great to have the stuffed animal on the end for them to hold or play with
Great quality product. Not only is it great for soothing baby as a pacifier, but the mustache serves as a teether for my son.
They are perfect for little hands to hold and when the kids have outgrown the pacifier, they can still play with the animals.
the product was exactly what i thought it would be regarding quality and value.  i what recommend this for the bob/peg combo.
I guess these are safer because they're made of just a single piece of plastic / rubber / gum. My newborn seems to like them.
our son is 19 months and still sleeping in a sleepsack, this one works great, and it keeps him from climbing out of his crib!
bought this for a girlfriends baby shower and it is just so cute! i have also purchased this before for my sister. its a hit!
My daughter loves them!  And the fact that they glow in the dark makes it so much easier for us to find in her crib at night!
Really cute. My daughter wouldn't use it because she was so attached to her caterpillar one, but it is still a great product!
My son absolutly loves this and wont use any other passie !!!<br />No Complaints !!!<br />No Regrets !<br />It is made well !
Would buy again.  This was a requested item for a registry and I had no trouble getting it shipped directly to the recipient.
My 6mo loved his little froggy.  Unfortunately it is now lost somewhere in the house or car...so I'd recommend buying extras.
My 3 month old loves these binks.<br />They seem comfortable and are sturdy.<br />I would buy again for sure!!!!<br />Love um
My newborn only seemed to like these pacifiers for some reason. I would recommend buying a couple as they do get lost easily.
My son loves this and always asks for his giraffe. After losing dozens of binkys I wish I would have had this from the start!
These orthodontic pacifier work great, our 1 month old grandson did not like the ones from the hospital, but he loves these..
these cups have consistently been the only ones that last without leaking that we have found! they are great and inexpensive!
My daughter is exclusively breastfeed and these don't affect her feedings. We love them and everyone loves how cute they are.
so easy to link to your main unit; great quality. no issues whatsoever between switching back and forth with our two cameras!
i am very happy with the graco pack n play playard. so easy to set up. my daughter loves it as well. (i purchased it for her)
this is the best teether ! gave it to my 6 month old grandbaby and she didn't put it down! a little pricey but well worth it!
Great product!  Very happy with the purchase, great for the little Lion fan! I recommend for all who are avid football fans!!
She loved this so much because she could easily hold, grab, and position it. We got a back up in case she lost the first one.
these work very well, so much easier for us to use than the typical difficult to remove snap-in protectors, and stylish, too.
fits nicely my bugaboo. i bought it here half price- the original price is about 90$ -sweet!<br />love the color- dark brown.
i love these utensils!  they're just right for my two-year old daughter!  i've tried a number of other ones but these are #1!
the item is just as i thought it would be, i haven't tried it out yet because baby isn't here but it will get tried out soon!
I use these wubbanub pacies for my babies in their bed because it is easier to find it at night. I love them for that reason!
very nice, very big, and with a plug so you don't have to break it. can't wait to give it to my great grandson for christmas!
fits crib perfectly well with square corners. nice and firm on infant side, softer on the toddler side.  high quality product
love them they are my favorite love the brand as a whole. i love that they are snap and dont catch on everything in the wash.
excellent stroller! i love it, good quality for good price!!!! i have two kids and i recommend this stroller for all parents!
this pumping bra is the best. very comfortable, fits well, and very adjustable for a perfect fit. makes pumping a lot easier!
my baby cant live without these pacifiers.  they give me additional hours of sleep daily because they help my baby calm down.
came quickly as expected, quality as expected also! so very cute and the mustache reminds me of the little ones great grandpa
Awesome product. My child loves it! One thing wish the pacifier could easily be removed from the stuffed animal for cleaning.
charm me my product with expectations fulfilled, what was expected recommend it 100% all was very fast and safe, great seller
looks as picture stuffed little pillows with a musical box that plays twinkle twinkle little star a very nice musical mobile.
these are the best pacifiers. you dont lose them as often. they last a long time and it something for the kid to cuddle with.
My babies love wubbanubs.  It helps little ones find the pacifier at night and a cute stuffy. No more lost pacifiers in crib.
Super cute and good quality pacifier. Will order again as these are my favorite. Definitely recommend them to anyone looking!
had the matching stroller already and was happy to find the seat so i didn't have to buy a new travel system for the new baby.
this sign is perfect for reminding visitors to take it slow in the driveway. very visible and good quality corrugated plastic.
it is a great product, my son loves it. he is able to relax in the shopping cart while i am buying all the things that i need.
i got this set at walmart for under $100... great buy. i would def. recommend. looks beautiful in the room for my little girl!
i love it that i can get what i wanted from my daughter. i have prime and got it sooner than i was told. my daughter loves it!
my daughter is six months old and she can even pick up this ball thanks due the design.  it is heavy duty and a great product.
really cute and easy to use. it's alittle heavy but that's from the weight inside holding the wides. other than that i love it
My granddaughter loves it, it makes us laugh, and no confuses it as hers.  It is the size for an 18month, which worked for us.
we were having trouble finding mittens for our newborn boy (he has long fingers) and these fit the bill!!! so happy with them.
This pasci is good for moms on the go. I would recommend this to others, what a great idea to put a protector on this product.
My babies love their wubbanubs! Sometimes they aren't even interested in the pacifier part, they just like the stuffed animal.
great frame! i was looking for a nice frame that covers the first year of my baby's life. this is just what i was looking for.
excellent quality product. Recommended 100% to the entire community. The product is as described. Therefore I give it 5 stars.
nice, breathable material. i like the &#34;lip&#34; part of the cover which allows me to see my baby and provides ventilation.
i use this product for items that need to be transferred to different vehicles.  easy to move and sturdy enough to do the job.
brilliant idea.  Makes it easy for your baby or toddler to find their soothie when sleeping in a dark room.  Deserves 6 stars.
great item. keeps baby entertained. when she lost the first one had to get a new one would not stop crying if she didnt get it
I had to buy this product. After receiving it at the hospital i tried others, they were not the same. She loved this pacifier.
These are excellent but MAKE SURE YOU ONLY USE THEM FOR GIRLS, AS ADVERTISED. Using them with boys turns your boys into girls.
this monster lovie is one of my daughter's favorites!  she must have her &#34;mon-ser&#34; when she goes to sleep every night!
These straps worked great for us during a recent vacation. They also work well on our son's highchair and stroller. Great buy.
I bought this for my son because i thought it would be funny. And it was. He really likes it too, it's one of his favorites :)
Great reception, Great battery charge too can go all night without being plugged in so i can wear it on my bely withe clip on!
these are the new favorites in my house! he loves the shapes and i love the way they use so much of the bread! little waste!!!
My baby loves these pacifiers and kids get a kick out of watching him suck on it because they can see the inside of his mouth.
product was as described and maybe even better. received item fast and great packing. would buy again and recommend to others.
These were an excellent pacifier choice from the many different choices out there. They lasted long and the babies loved them.
These pacifiers are awesome. My son loves them so much and they calm him down almost immediately unless he's hungry of course.
love this crib and so glad i have it. came just as described and well built. fits perfectly and i can't live without it now :)
They've been durable so far (including several times through the washer), and he'll suck on them happily for extended periods.
My daughter absolutely loves this binky. She was able to grab it and put it in her mouth a lot sooner than a regular pacifier.
Helps reduce the countless times my daughter drops her pacifier and keeps her more content in her car seat. Easy to clean too!
I bought this for my grand daughter, and many people would stop us to ask where we bought it. Love it and many others as well.
these pouches are great! so easy to fill and clean. my daughter thinks it is so fun to fill them with our own homemade purees.
My daughter is a preemie and she does very well with these pacifiers. They are easy to keep in and soft enough for her to use.
it is a high level useful device. we are most satisfied with this purchase.<br />highly recommended for newly parents or other
the bassinet cover was as beautiful as it is in the picture and of very  good quality. it was shipped safely and very quickly.
My grandson loves this & so do I. It's easy to find & grab when he's upset. It doesn't get lost as easily as a plain pacifier.
I have bought others for my newborn and 2 other friends with newborns so far. You cannot go wrong with this .. Babies love it!
My baby loves these! My only complaint is that when I wash them, some water always gets stuck inside and it's hard to get out.
Exactly as advertised Great deal and good quality and fast shipping will definitely recommend and come back soon thanks again.
i got this for a toddler car bed. it is strong. my toddler climbes over it to get in and out of bed.  deff would recommend it.
i really love those caps,it came out so much handy and easy to clean .highly recommend.two thumbs up for all avent products!!!
i love how light the car seat is.  it is very easy to pull in and out of the base as well.  i am very happy with this product.
These are great. Very durable. I figured the rubber mustache would be cheesy and break. Still holding on strong. It is a hoot!
i bought this for my baby and it is a perfect mat for playtime. it is colorful with great textures. also shipped very quickly!
Better price than in store (even Walmart).  Breastfed, post tongue/lip-tie revision baby takes these bottles and pacifier well!
Bought this for my nephew, it's his favorite binky of all time! He loves to look at himself in the mirror with it. So much fun!
My daughter loves these, she won't use anything but this brand. They are very durable and don't have much scent to them either.
Bought this one as a gift for friends baby boy, enjoys it as much as my baby girl. Amazing quality and product can recommend !!
had a bit of trouble trying to install it facing backwards & ended up having to have it face forward.  otherwise, great carseat
easy to put up<br />easy to use<br />looks great<br />just what i was looking for<br />opens both ways which is a great addtion
a little hard to squeeze, but the best nasal aspirator!!!  really gets everything out, without having to go in there 500 times.
Fantastic product, was told by the hospital we wouldn't be able to fine anything similar to the one my lo was given on the nicu
don't leak, don't stink, easy to clean, keep drinks cold all day long with out ice.  and, my son loves that they are toy story.
Best pacifier ever! My son wouldn't take any other pacifier than this. He absolutely loves it. I totally recomend this product.
it is in the baby's crib and my daughter requested this item is very happy with the gift of the taggies developmental baby doll
my 6 months old baby loves it!!!! she wants to carry this toy everywhere. i love all the tunes. i highly recommend this product
With having animals in the house, hair is everywhere. I purchased this to keep his pacifiers hair free while in his diaper bag.
These pacifiers are SO cute!  And I love how they are made, very durable.  I think I've found a new favorite for my little man.
We love these binks.  I also like that with the size 2, gunk doesn't build up around the base of the nipple.  Stays very clean.
Can not go wrong with this brand! it is made with high quality and makes a great product! will buy more for the next age group!
My baby's favorite paci/toy in one. The horns are great for little baby hands to hold on to. Great for our little Texas baby :)
It was just what it said it would be. My mother-to-be loved it. It was given as a gift at a shower and it  made every one laugh
Wish I had one when my sons were born. It works great not only keeping the paci clean, it can hook on anything to keep it handy
I got this for my grand nephew.  Granted, it's not so much for him as for the amusement of everyone else, but it was a big hit.
Received quickly. Loved it...a gift for the birth of my first grandbaby and ALL were pleased and amused with this item! A hoot!
This was a little treasure I stuck into the pocket on the zebra-and-hot-pink diaper bag I found. The mother-to-be was thrilled!
Best pasifiers on the market I believe. When she's not using it, she can chew on it as a teether. I love the flexibility of it!
i got this diaper bag for my daughter & she just loves all the pockets. it is roomy & the strap is comfortable on the shoulder.
this is a fantastic product. i wish it was around when i was nursing 20 years ago.  it is an absolute must for nursing mothers.
These pacifiers are wounderful. They are flush enough that they don't get knocked out while my son is sleeping. He loves them!!
We love Graco car seats. Keeps my almost 3 year old snug and safe. Has been washed a couple of times and still looks brand new.
used this on fireplace edge and corners to protect kids.  very easy to use and took just minutes to apply.  happy with results.
this one should work. It's cute. It's easy to find when set down. It's soft and washable. It's made from high quality material.
My baby loves these!  bought more to keep around the house and in the baby bag!  Well made and in one piece.  no plastic smell.
This was for my pregnant niece who is doing a sheep theme for the nursery - this particular sheep was very small and very cute.
my baby loves it. I received this pretty quick and was very satisfied. this is small and easy to take along with us everywhere.
My son loves this pacifier.  I bought the super soothie and he didn't like it as much so I bought this one and he JUST LOVES IT
My daughter LOVES this.  It is easy for her to hold on to, easy to find in bed in the middle of the night, and soft and cuddly!
this one is perfect for storage baby food you make. easy to store and easy to remove, and it's deep and can store lots of food.
one of the best safety door knobs for 2 plus year old. i have a 2.5yr old n he hasn't figured out how to use it yet, thank god.
Works great for my newborn-it doesn't fall on the floor and roll all over like a regular paci!  It is alot less germy that way!
The owl nub is a litte bigger/sturdier than the other ones and it holds better.  Plus it's super cute.  My daughter loves this.
i am 25 weeks pregnant and i love this product. great pillow. very comfy, i couldn't do without it. would definitely recommend.
Worked wonderfully for keeping pacifier in baby's mouth while lying on back in swing. Probably would work well in car seat too.
These are the only pacifiers my baby will take and these came faster then they said, only 3 days! Great service, great product!
I bought this and 2 other Wubbanubs. It's all I use and they're absolutely fantastic. They wash easily and hold up really well.
What would I do without this lil guy! My daughter LOVES him! I had wash and allow it to air dry in front of a fan or something.
it matches exactly to the color on her bugaboo cameleon..and it keeps her warm and it cleans easily if anything is spilt on it.
These pacifiers are so easy to find when thrown or missing. My son loves the WubbaNub line and continues to use them every day.
wish it was still available but couldn't find one recently when i looked to buy another for the newest addition to our. family.
Can't go wrong with this brand, it's the only one my son will take. I got two basketball pacifiers in my shipment. As expected.
I got this as a gift for the baby shower and the mother to be loved it. Its cute, super soft and very practican, I can imagine!
It was a gift for my sisters baby!! She loves it!!! But my note didn't come with so she didn't know who it was from tough... :/
This is just what we were hoping for, a boy version of the cow! Weighted legs, a very soft plush body and even cuter in person.
ordered this for my daughter's nursery. item arrived in no time and is super plush. easily fits the summer infant changing pad.
This pacifier is so easy to find.  We have had two for over a year and my daughter can find it easily on her own. Great product!
About the funnies thing you've EVER seen on a little new born princess. Worth the price of the ticket just for the picture opt!!
have bought countless of these (eaten by family dog). lifesavers鈥? my #1 item to make sure that i have before leaving the house!
i love this stroller it's very user friendly and light weight which is good for me since i can't lift anything heavy. i love it.
Absolutely love these! Attaches securely to our LO's stroller and diaper bag. Easy to open and can store two easily. A good buy.
baby loved this for the first few months. it helped to keep it near him when he was too little to grab it. also, it's very cute!
It's so fun that my four year old wants house it as a toy. Perfect for it's purpose, keeps the pacifier clean, it's a bit bulky.
this product is the cutest item.. i just could not have picked a cuter theme for my grandson's son we r expecting in oct 2013...
My baby loves MAM Air pacifiers and I love that it helps keep the area around his mouth dry, especially now that he drools more.
they are adorable.  much more appealing to the onlooker than the traditional plain ones.  just the right size for an infant too.
I love them , just what I expected, good quality for the price, can be used on any straw so no need to wash straws this is great
very adorable item. shipped extremely quick, and the packaging (gift box) for this item is adorable.<br /><br />highly recommend
I like this pacifier because the stuffed animal makes it extremely easy for infants to grab. This is the second one I've bought.
i bought these for our granddaughter and she loves them.  she enjoys them in the bathtub as well as in the pool and at the lake.
Bought this for a good friend having a baby- delivery fast and very cute. She loved it, can't wait to see pictures of him w/ it.
They are very soft and natural feeling. My baby loves them! Highly recommended. Haven't found other pacifiers better than these.
We actually got about 8 of these binkeys between shower gifts and what he was given in the NICU and we loved having all of them.
Got this as a &#34;congrats&#34; gift when I first heard my friend was having a baby. Came in a timely manner and they loved it.
Love this cute owl and pacifier - it is so adorable!  What a great combination - can't wait to give this as a baby shower gift!!
Both of my grandkids have used these.  LOVE THEM so much I ordered these for my granddaughter who is expected to be here in May.
These were awesome.  Gave them to my Niece as a fun item to use on her new child.  Lots of fun and laughs and reasonably priced.
My new great grandson is only 1 month old. So not quite ready for it.  But his mommy loves the idea of it & can't wait to use it
it's simple, practical, fits nicely and so far we love it! it cold have a higher back or a specified size for suvs but it works.
i love it if baby loves it. Nothing like a plug to satisfy little sweetie when he's fussing, and this one seems to do the trick.
Cutest pacifier on the market. Any picture I take of my son with this binky makes me melt. I want to buy the other styles too :)
My twin boys absolutely love this binki. It worked so well and now that they are older they still enjoy playing with the animal.
My daughter loves this product and it is so cute. She can easily hold it and put it in her mouth without help. It is never lost.
this comes in super handy to unbuckle the car seats. why do they have to make them so difficult?? it also protects my nails too.
my son loves nuk pacifiers. wish finding nipples was as easy as finding a pacifier. i need nuk wideneck 6+ mos medium nipples!!!
This is great for bedtime because ithe elephant can be made to sit so it stays in my daughters mouth better. It's very cute too!
My little guy loved these pacifiers when he was a newborn! Still has some he uses every now and then and he is 8 mo tha old now!
Must have for little ones... Great quality and love the Pattern. Easy to find in a bag or purse.  We have several diff patterns.
we used this gate to block off our tv and dining room.  easily positionable and easy to install.  love it.  well worth the cost.
my baby loves this she wont go to sleep without it glad i purchased this it is cute and easy to find when they drop the pacifier
Very cute and durable. My daughter loves the little animals and she cuddles with them to. A++++ product and would get them again
a great touch and explore book.  our grandchild really enjoys reading it with us, and he is 10 months old. i would buy another!!
I love these, they work just like the regular green ones, but I like that my daughter has various colors to match her outfits :)
My son loved this pacifier as an infant but it took a long time to break him away from it. Overall it was great comfort for him.
my little girl loves her potty chair!  the color but looks pink...it's purple!  have to leave it on or buy a hook to hang it on.
Works very well, quality made. The plastic holds tight and the net holding part does well to keep the food in. Def recommend it!
My daughter LOVED these binkies!!! Great price, great product, and fast shipping! I'll be ordering these again for my next baby!
At one point these were very hard for me to find. Now they are everywhere. THESE ARE THE ONES GINEN TO NEWBORNS IN THE HOSPITAL.
Exclusively breast feed, and she does well with these,love the color. I dont worry either bc it would be impossible to choke on.
great size and wonderful absorbancy. so much better than many of the fashion, burp cloths that look cute but don't soak much up.
my grandson absolutely loves danny the duck.  it's easy for him to grasp and hold his bottle while he is cuddling with his duck.
I got these for my son from the hospital and they were so awesome that I bought them for my daughter years later! Easy to clean!
Great product I have been using it for four months. I hand wash with natural baby soap and hot water. I am ordering two more now.
perfect for transferring a sleeping baby from the car to a swing. and it's compact size is great for small places and travelling.
This is my second one. My son loves them. The monkey lays flat on his tummy, which is why I like it. Will be buying another soon!
I bought these to tell my lions fan husband he was going to be a father!  We had a girl, but she still used them for the games :)
Our baby loves the NUK pacifiers.  These are no exception and they are my favorites because they are SO CUTE in the baby's mouth!
This item was recieved quickly. It is a very nice baby shower gift. My daughter loves it. Hopefully it will work for you as well.
great pacifier, our baby loves the &#34;soothies&#34; and having these little animals on the end helps keep the paci in his mouth
neutral colors were excellent.  best price for these diaper.  the stand up to wear and my husband and day care love the easy use.
Not only is this pacifier hilarious, but it is also high quality and not some cheaply made novelty item. Well worth the purchase.
works well, push down on it when placing it on the seat for suction and it hold great. easy to clean. very happy with my purchase
My daughter loved this gift for my new granddaughter. The cute little lamb helps the pacifier stay put close to the baby's mouth.
it looks exactly as pictured and was delivered in satisfactory shape.  my baby is not born yet so i can only attest to its looks.
These are the same binkies that the hospital gives the newborns. Needless to say that my baby took well to them. She loves them!!
the product is great quality and a great price. I definitely love it! I would definitely refer this product! Very stylish as well
wish we had figured this out sooner.  pack and play without a mattress is like sleeping on the ground.  she sleeps all night now.
Mom to be was excited to have these glow in dark pacifiers.  Baby not here yet so not sure how well they are working out for her.
i bought this to use to wash small toys in. it works perfectly to hold the toys in place, but still get them clean and sanitized!
depending on which pacifiers i choose I can actually put 2 in here! very convenient, I like that I can clip it onto the stroller.
My uncle told me about these binkys and I'm glad he did cu they are awesome thank you and I highly reccomend this seller an brand
i got this book for my sister in law. its very cute. there are plenty of pages to fill with baby info. highly recommend this book
love nuby products! bought the entire set for our grandson and he loves them. bright and colorful. easy for small hands to grasp.
love nuby products! bought the entire set for our grandson and he loves them. bright and colorful. easy for small hands to grasp.
love the baby magic.  nothing better then a great smelling baby. great for their hair and body.  still use it on my six year old.
cutest binky ever<br />wubbanubs have so many to pick from and they are all cute<br />have bought several more for gifts and self
We have bought at least 20 of these pacifiers because he will not use anything else.  They are easy to clean and attach a holder.
My Daughter loves this, but more for the bright colors than the pacifier function. its a nice little toy for her keep in her crib
Godchildren love the products NUK has wonderful products. The only issue was the site should allow customers to select the color.
I bought these for a friend and she told me that her son preferred these over all of the others she received for her baby shower.
My baby loved these! They were perfect for when he was little and they soothed him to sleep because of their design. I recommend!
i got these as spares for my son when he was little.  i froze these for when he was teething.  i would recommend them to anybody.
love these. makes losing pacifiers so much harder, finding them so much easier, but when they are lost more expensive to replace.
brought this for my nephew love that it came on time and well packaged.. happy with it. good price love that i can shop on line..
The baby pacifiers are great and of great quality and are cute for my baby. I love the graphics and most of all I love the timing
Great value, these are my daughters favorite pacifiers because they are identical to the ones the hospital provides. Awesome buy!
i've had one of these with all 3 of my kids and i love them! they're perfect for keeping track of all the milestones and changes.
I love this product. Its so easy for my grandchild find it and place it back in his mouth. They fit perfectly in his little hand.
this is the perfect pacifier holder ever designed, I was recommend them for any parent of a newborn to buy and use them. cute too
great lunch bag.  beautiful colour and well made.  fun to take for lunch - definitely something different!  my daughter loved it!
this binky is very cute for all occasions my 7 month old son just looks so funny but its adorbz! recommended for your lil monters
just installed my new gate. very simple to install and put together! i am very happy with this purchase. i may buy a second gate.
the base for the snug ride was very difficult to find in the store and that is why i used them and it worked out. great price too
We tried Avent, Nuk, & these, and these are the only pacifiers our breast feeding son will accept. He spits the others right out.
this is the best seat there is for extended rear facing. best value. so easy to use. will last a really long time. we love it!!!!
I got these for a very good friend who is expecting twins. She is a huge fan like myself and it was a huge hit at the baby shower.
I love these glow-in-the-dark binkies for my little one...easier to find at night and I love that thety came with a carrying case.
Not much to say about this. The kitty takes a lot of abuse and hasn't fallen apart. Makes it easier to keep track of the pacifier.
these bumpers were a bit difficult to install the first time, but in view of their light weight and soft surfaces, i rate them a 5
Very soothing for my daughter and easy to find. I keep it clean by putting it through the washing machine and it washes up nicely.
easy to install, looks cute, and serves it's purpose.  also keeps my daughter's legs from getting stuck in between the crib slats.
these bags are so incredibly helpful! especially for working moms like me, to freeze bags ahead of time before going back to work.
i love these bottles! but never sterilize in a sterilizer that you don't know is safe or not safe for the bottles. mine warped. 馃槙
My granddaughters both love these! They are easy for their little hands to hold and easy to clean. The styles are pretty cute too!
this is a great watch it reminded my daughter to go potty all on her own. only down side is they really should make it water proof
My son loves his Wubbanub. I couldn't find a back up giraffe at the store so I'm so happy they have one on Amazon:) now we have 3.
don't waste water filling the bathtub. this tub is great, it is simple, and foldable.  easy to travel with too.  highly recommend.
what to write ? best stuff... no air pockets when kid drinks.. good ones.<br />no issues as this is second kid using same types...
I love it, everyone in the family loves it, my friends all love it. It's holding up well - made with quality materials. Too funny.
Easy to clean. Easy to use. The quality of this product was above my expectations. And the most important thing: my baby likes it.
My daughter preferred these pacifiers over the others we gave her. They're also great because she can chew on them while teething.
This one is awesome ... helps big time with upset baby.. easy to keep in car or carriage and dont loose easy because of attachment
I got it for my new nephew who has it at all times. It was recommended by my cousins whose son and daughter were big fans with it.
i feel so much more comfortable at night since buying this one. especially while co-sleeping, and while transitioning to the crib.
Saw this on shark tank and ordered before episode was over! Haven't actually used it bc my baby is still a newborn but can't wait!
i love how the mattress pad has deeper pockets so it goes easily over the mattress. i would definitely recommend this to everyone.
Good quality, BPA free, easy handle it. Baby won't cry with it. And my sister love it, two packs can be used for a long long time.
No more losing the pacifier when it is attached to a cute puppy. Easy for tiny hands to hold on to and put back in to their mouth.
These are so cute and my son loves them.  It was great quality and good value.  Plus, it never seems like you have enough binkies!
this fits my safty1st playard, i was so happy i found something to give my little one more cushion it that hard cardboard playard.
love them my nephew would not hold a regular bottle because they're cold<br />the handled bottles did the trick he just loves them
My son loves his Wubbanub!! He is not a pacifier kid but he will take this one. Love that I can always locate it and it's so cute.
This has been the best thing ever. We have five different ones. Highly recommend.  One for all floors and cars.  Safe and adorable
The colors are great. They seem to know what colors go with the child's wardrobe. The shape of the Lavoisier makes the baby happy.
this crib was bought for sleep-over grandbabies, but it is sturdy enough for your baby's room.  great to store away for later use.
I bought this for my 5 month old nephew and he absolutely love it. He grabs it and play with it.  I would definitely recommend it.
I bought this for my 5 month old nephew and he absolutely love it. He grabs it and play with it.  I would definitely recommend it.
Great product was exactly what I was looking for. Fast service will recommend to others. I will be leaving more from this company.
This is even cuter in person.  I bought a couple for new baby boys and girls. Great pics are guaranteed and the baby liked it too.
This is the 2nd one we've bought for our daughter, she just loves them in the swing and carseat! The dragon was a fun one to pick.
We owned these from the store and they are exactly the same. Too bad my grandson decided he was done with pacifiers one week later
My new born LOVES this, he likes hugging it while he uses it. Fits in his hands just fine, we have tons of monkey stuff for him :)
excellent product and price and i love the fact that i can carry all my brushes together (and add some that didnt come in the kit)
i'm so happy to have extra parts! it makes pumping that much easier and take the hassle out of having to clean up after each time.
we bought two of these as gifts for our children's newborns.  it was the best gift we could have given.  this monitor works great!
My grandbaby loves his God Bless Lamb. Kuddles it all the time. The pacifier is just the right size for a 1 to 2 month old and up.
great price for the silicone tubing, durable, and very easy to use and disinfect if you use the medela microwave disinfection bags
great product! it was what i expected.<br />amazing quality... easy to assemble and drive. if you want a good stroller this is it!
Love these things! Our daughter took it everywhere with her, and it made it easy to find and keep track of, and it stays in place!
the baby loves this. the monkey makes it more easy to keep track of and also helps somewhat with keeping her from spitting it out.
Love NUK pacifiers. These ones are adorable. Love the heart and elephant, and easy to pair with outfits without clashing terribly.
very happy with waterproof liner, since it lies very flat, unlike other liners i've used. i've subsequently ordered 3 more liners!
fit my bright starts sleepeasy perfectly. minimal gaps around the edges, i think it's as tight a fit as you can reasonably expect.
Adorable stripes, fits two pacifiers inside, the little handle lets you attach it to other things, great pattern, would buy again.
I was afraid the quality would be poor but it's a perfectly standard pacifier. I recommend it for fun and good spirits around you!
What a great pair of pacifiers. The colors are really great and it's of a nice quality. This is a gift for a friend's baby shower.
2 yr old loves his Dino.  He will ugly take a wub a nub but they are so cute I am okay with it.  Colors are pretty true to picture
the doll was soft and looked nice. my wife purchased it for our 10 month old niece for christmas and she seemed to really like it.
Wubbanubs are my &#34;go-to baby gift&#34;!  Parents love them almost as much as the babies do!  They are durable and super handy!
I wish i thought of this! Perfect for baby to have something to hold, esp in the first months when they get startled & jump easily!
Tried these with my breastfed baby. She took it for a few days.Hard to say bc she never wanted any pacifier. But shipping was fast.
My son was born during the baseball season and he must have known it too.  He will only use Texas Rangers pacifiers to go to sleep.
My baby loves this thing!  I had never heard of wubbanubs before but now I think everyone should have at least one.  We have 4 now!
this bottle i keep at my house for my grand daughter.  she loves drinking her milk from it. her little hands go around it perfectly
Bought  this for my nephew.  He loves it!!! He loves all wubbanubs.  They are also easier to keep track of than regular passifiers.
no complaints at all on this. does exactly what it's supposed to do, and it's also easy to cut if you need to trim it down to size.
easy and cheap and practical. you can't go wrong with these. have definitely  recommended these to my friends. thanks again britax!
The pacifier set was purchased as a gift and the mom to be absolutely loved it.  Exactly as described and the words are very clear.
My girlfriend put this on her baby registry  (she registered for amazon.com) Her baby boy loves them. Its a good/trusted brand too.
i am not a fan of the forks since the 2 inner pieces are the only ones that you can stab food with, however, they get the job done.
very user friendly and so comfortable for babies. dries quickly and stores easily with hanging loop. also great newborn photo prop.
got me through the second half of pregnancy with more sleep than i would have had without it! definitely a must for pregnant mamas!
I like these pacifiers because they allow more room between my son's chin and his pacifier, so he doesn't end up with chapped skin.
fred is a great toy! when ever he is touched, he starts moving forward and barking/whining. my munchkin loves to follow him around!
It's well-made and gets a ton of double-takes and compliments. My baby is always the hit of the party... and he has no idea why :-)
amazing...i bought this 8+ years ago.  went thru two grand d. loved it all.  wore great.  ordered additional items from theme also.
My son has the turtle and monkey. He loves them both. He longer cares for the pacifier but he still holds onto them to take naps :)
These are the best kind of pacifiers if you plan to breastfeed.  Have used these before and my babies seemed to like them the best.
love, love these changing pads. they are perfect sized and soooo easy to wash. lightweight and you can take them anywhere with you!
My grandson loves this so much I ordered a spare.  He loves to hold the giraffe and it is just the right size for his little hands.
My daughter really liked this since she didn't have one for her first pregnancy.<br />Looks to be a safer way to dispense medicine.
Great product. Just like the hospitals use. Bought pink/ purple for girl twin and green for boy twin so I can keep paci's separate!
Got these for my granddaughter who spends time here and is sometimes without her paci ... arrived right on time and she loves them!
This looks amazing over the jaipuri quilt and shams, very rich looking...everyone says wow when they come into our daughter's room!
this travel bag was a lifesaver for us, we gate checked it and there was plenty of room in it to store some other baby essentials!!
Love it! My daughter goes nuts for these things and rightfully so! She gets a lovey and pacifier in one! Totally love these things!
my littlest grandson plays with his rattle and loves it so!  nice size, and comfortable fit in baby's hand.  practical and playful!
I bought two pacifiers for a baby shower gift.  They are very cute and I'm sure they will keep both the new baby and the Mom happy.
These are very well made & priced well. I got them as decorative for a baby shower to top a gift. Nice pastel colors to choose from
i got a c.r. gibson baby memory book for one of my other kiddos and loved all the detail included. so i would definitely recommend!
Very fast shipping and very cute. My daughter loved this and I would recommend it to anybody. By far the cutest one I have ordered!
this is a very nice bath towel and washcloth set. my son loves diego. the quality of this set is far supieor than his previous set.
just picked them up and within 2 minutes they were installed in my truck. truck is now protected form the rug rats.. great purchase
it is so attractive that my granddaughter took to it and that made the potty training very successful. i'll recommend it to others.
Vendedor cumpli贸 con la entrega y expectativas del producto!! Vienen en paquete de dos, son los mjores pacificadores del mercado!!!
My daughter loves her little lamb.  This is a staple in our house and do yourself a favor and buy a couple in case you misplace it!
I love this little monkey! The passy atually come with it and it is permantly attached! my son lov monkeys they are his favorite!!!
works perfectly! my daughter's teeth don't pierce through and now i don't have to worry about her consuming the shellac on her crib
bought the set for my grandson, loved it, he enjoys eating with his new tools, which will last him until he's ready for the next si
easy to put together nice and comfortable well worth the price it took 10 minutes to pull it from the box until i was sitting in it
it's so soft and cute!! i'm very happy i went with this frog bed set!! looks just like the pic, love it!!! cant wait to set it up!!!
love this!  super durable (my 5yo son thrashes everything!) and easy to wipe clean.  going to buy another one for the in-laws house.
Our little one really likes both the bottles and the pacifiers in this set.  Plus the easy bottle sterilization system is fantastic.
My infant twins love these! They love snuggling with the stuffed animal and I don't have to worry about them getting lost so easily.
great product, will see if my baby likes it too. love the color, it is not as pink as in the picture, but i actually like it better.
this is a great second base to use for my graco snugride 32. it is essentially identical to the base that came with the infant seat.
These are the best thing ever. Not only is it the only pacifier my son will take but now he has a buddy that he loves to cuddle with
These are the only pacifier my breastfed son would take. We literally tried them ALL. I love how it's nipple shaped to resemble mom.
Philips AVENT BPA Pacifier are very quality products. High quality products. my 9 months old daughter plays with it too, like a toy.
Our baby really likes these pacifiers and my husband loves the sports themed ones. We like to have one handy for when he gets fussy!
the product is equal to what they promote. it met my expectations. recommended 100%. i have no complaints. i agree with what you buy
Love TT pacifiers and this design is just adorable. They seem to fit my 9 month olds face a bit better than NUK, though we use both.
love this product!  great quality, great material, love the detail and variation of texture.  i would highly recommend this product.
One son and daughter in law asked for this as a baby shower gift. We were lucky enough to use it when we visited and it  works well.
I chose this specific one for the colors. Go Gators. But my son loves this one more than the puppy because its lighter and brighter!
Avent pacifiers are always very well-made, and my daughter absolutely love them. She won't put pacifiers from other brands in mouth.
this is adorable! it is soft and very well made. the perfect addition to any jungle or safari nursery. i'm so glad i purchased this!
My 4 month old adores this. He is able to easily get the soother to his mouth as well. Super soft and the soother seems very secure.
baby can't roll out. it has a great shape. easy to use. big enough to last quite awhile. i highly recommend over flat changing pads.
use it for my 9 mo.old grandsons baby food. does great job,shipped quickly.small enough for a single serve or several days of foods.
My little ones favorite pacifier and the only one she would take really. She uses it as her friend now but still attached to it too.
Exactly what I was wanting and needing for a baby shower! I received it quickly also which was a HUGE plus!! The baby LOVES it too!!
It's the only one my daughter will take since it moves in and out like a women's breast when nursing!! Highly recommended product!!!
These pacifiers are great. I love there is another option for colors. I have twin girls so it is nice each one gets their own color!
great toy for my daughter, she loves it! she knows who he is and holds him during the show. not her fav toy yet but def her number 2
These pacifiers are adorable and the perfect size. The shape fits perfectly around his little nose. My new Nephew loves his already.
Best binky ever!  Used them for my son and now my daughter... A must have for new parents.. I buy them for everyone who is expecting
i absolutely love this blanket for my son.  it is super soft and it's great for cool mornings, nap time, or to lie on for play time.
good product, very good condition and presentation. it works in perfect condition. good choice. great for personal use or for gifts.
Got it for my son, its a bit big for his mouth, he was only 5 months old when we got it for him.  Still very cute when he puts it in.
i was looking for a slim high back booster for my 3rd row seating. this is perfect. makes putting 3 kids in the back row much easier.
My daughter loves these. We got two when she was born at the hospital but needed more to have around the house and in her diaper bag.
pacifier also serves as teething type of ring.  bought for great grand daughter and she loves it. would recommend to all new mothers.
the quality was even better than we had anticipated!  the little one loves the baby animals that are decorating the bottom and sides.
this really helped us with the huge pile of stuffed animals that were scattered around the playroom. now we have storage and seating.
Very cute! looks nice on the pictures! We sent postcard with our baby's photo with this pacifier to his grandfather. He was thrilled!
im so glad these were available on amazon!!<br />they are the only ones that my kids take.  make naptime and bedtime so much easier!!
really nice gate! this is so much easier to use than having to pull up on the wooden gates and then setting the gate off to the side!
Each baby is different, so I had to try many pacifiers to find some she liked.  Ultimately she liked the ones with the angled nipple.
Only paci my 3 babies will use. One full term baby and twin preemies. Make sure you get real ones not the first years imitation ones.
They are awesome because I have tried several and this is the one that has the most  space around nose to help baby breath~  thanks!!
cutest thermos ever. keeps my fruit salad cool and my soup warm for hours and looks adorable. makes working thru lunch fun... almost.
I鈥榤 going to have baby this September. i want to take some picture of him when he using this thing. Just not sure it's safety enough.
I saw this on Shark Tank and bought it for my granddaughter who is expecting her first child.<br />Can't wait to have her try it out!
i love my beco gemini! it's so comfortable and easy to use. i have other carriers (an infantino and a boba), but this is my favorite!
Comfortable and an EXCELLENTconversation starter meeting women in bars, especially in the south!<br />Try it, you'll be glad you did!
My 5 month old loves her elephant WubbaNub.  She puts every part of that elephant in her mouth....though she won't take the pacifier.
The pacifier arrived quickly and as described. It is really cute and very fitting for my first granddaughter due to be born very soon
My daughter loves her wubbanubba! We received it as a gift and purchased a second.  It's great for holding on to as they fall asleep.
My son never really used a pacifier but he loves to use these as teething toys, because they are easy for him to hold and manipulate.
Amazing.  SO AMAZING.  My little guy sleeps with this every night and he has for the past 17 months.  We bought a spare just in case!
The best thing I have bought for my baby. I have used this masher bowl every single day since my turned 6 months! Absolutely love it!
my daughter tried many didn't kinds of pacifiers and this is his favorite..he is 8 months old and it is his go to. good quality also.
good coverage, good sound quality, and pretty easy to set up, i just need a way to enter online to it for my happiness to be complete
very pleased momma & grandbaby both seem to appreciate the positives and anticipate long use and the portable speculation and comfort
love it, is very soft and has alot of air cushion. fits perfect with our quinny buzz xtra stoller. can't wait for our baby to use it!
This product was well priced, shipped extremely fast and I would definitely recommend it to anyone. I can't wait to see it in action!
She loves these pacifiers. They seem to just make her feel so much better. All the fussing stops as long as we keep her Avent nearby.
what a cute gift this toy makes. i've given it twice.  well made, colorful and offers different surfaces to touch, soft, crunchy, etc
My baby boy's favorite toy.  At 3 months old he is already &#34;kinda&#34; holding his bottles because of learning to hold his puppy.
perfect as trash bag liners to the hanging trash bags in my boat's heads! exactly the right size. wish it didn't have printing on it.
Bought this for my sons 1st birthday party. He actually liked using it as his pacifier for the whole afternoon.<br />I recommend this
arrived on time. brandnew and packaged well. complete. wish there was a choice of what colour i wanted but i'm fine with the product.
Love these.  The animal provides a little weight so an infant doesn't spit it out.  Also, easy for them to find in the crib at night.
great car seat, highly recommend.  our daughter is tall for her age, and the size of this is perfect.  price was very affordable too!
My son loves this. He has 3 different characters. I love this product also. It's a life saver at times when baby is cranky or hungry.
i like that this bag is double layered because it helps to keep smells at bay! we can easily fit 2 days worth of dirty diapers in it!
I love it.  My son is able to hang on to it or put it back in his mouth and it does not go flying to the ground when he spits it out.
this is a gift for my nephew and i will be buying another for our new edition. this is a great toy, great quality. worth every penny.
these bottles and pacifiers are such a life saver i haven't been able to find a good bottle that works with him but these work great!
looks great in the package and hoping my daughter will love it! my son loved these nipples so we are hoping our daughter is the same.
Love this product for my daughter!! She loves to hold the animal while she sleeps and it makes it much easier for her to use herself!
it was great, it was a gift for my at-the-time unborn niece/nephew and i'm sure she is going to love it. her mom (uom alum) sure did!
excellent product i love these pacifiers! they also fit into the pacifier covers for the avent orthodontic pacifiers i have! go pats!
got this for a little girl room age 4, she loves it, sleeps with like a stuff animal, i don't know if hypo allergic or even washable.
My daughter loved these and so did we as they don't contain any plastic pieces that would otherwise leave marks around my babies face.
Great product. It comes with the soothie paci well attached to the fuchsia giraffe. Easy to use, washes beautifully and baby likes it.
bought this pump and found that it works great, noise is minimum and pumps 5ozs in about 8mins on low speed, for me this is a best buy
so much better than the boppy and deflatability came in very handy for travelling.  in fact, i used this as my primary nursing pillow.
Super cute! However, I thought I would be getting yellow and they sent me blue but I dont care becuase the blue ones are just as cute!
Loved it! Only paci baby would take and super cute! Love that toy prevents paci from getting lost and touching the ground less likely!
Our baby loves these. Very handy and cute. I wish they were made with the orthodontic pacifiers because we need to transiton to those.
The only pacifier my baby will use. The little plush animal helps her hold it and this one almost never gets lost like the other once.
thank you for your fast and friendly  serves.the game was really fun to play. It is a grate game for people to get to know one another
Love these pacifiers. I used these with my son when he was a baby almost 10 yrs ago and I always recommend them to breastfeeding moms.
I haven't yet used to pacify game yet. however I did open the package and I'm sure we will enjoy the game once the baby shower starts.
I love these pacifiers because of the natural rubber and my son prefers these over the plastic ones too.  They're super easy to clean.
i finally got my daughter to brush her teeth!! she loves snacking on bananas and such. if i was a 2 year old, i might've brushed more.
I just love my baby girl's bunny. We get so many comments on it. Most people don't realize it's a paci until she puts it in her mouth.
Easy to clean, no weird smell, feels secure. These are pretty similar to Nuk pacifiers, but I like the material better. Nice pacifier.
my son loves this pacifier. I like because it is easy to clean. some other pacifier are very hard to clean or impossible to clean when
my two and a half year old son loves these. they stick to the tub and wall tiles easily. also, the bag is very convenient for storage.
My kids love it;  we are collecting all models; if you are looking the best try to give it to your kids happiness and healthy products
I love these adorable little guys!  This one is smaller than the original sized ones, about half that size.  He's cute as the dickens!
This is the only binky my baby girl will take! I love that they have a plasic cover so I don't have to worry about them getting dirty.
This is the cutest little pacifiers ever!!!  If you a fan of monkeys, this is a must have! My new little grandson is going to love it.
this is the same binky the hospital uses, my last two kids have liked them. no spit/face rash. no complaints exactly what we expected.
Love it.. The little bit of weight it has in the feet helps it to stay in my 2 month old's mouth.. I will be ordering another animal..
Love this and can't wait to use it. It's also great because it holds 2 pacifiers. Just wish they offered more of a variety of designs.
love them ....great colors but  wish the white ones were a different color say purple or two other of the fun colors...love the snaps!
if you are thinking to buy soothers these ones are the best on the market I try it on my little ones and its perfect 100% recommend it
I am so in love with itzyritzy!!!! purchased their snack bags and wet bag!! will be purchasing more, great product and for great gifts
Really cute and a real conversation piece?  Luv it, Luv it, Luv it! I doesn't even itch, but tickles all who see it?  Really fun item!
My kids love it;  we are collecting all models; if you are looking the best try to give it to your kids happiness and healthy products
looks great! works great! being able to swing both ways and close by itself are great features. i would highly recommend this product.
these bottles are best for storing milk. no worries about what plastic ingredients might be leaching into your formula or breast milk.
this fits my 12 month old great. he stays nice and warm when he sleeps and there is no worry of getting caught or twisted in blankets.
My daughter absolutely loves this pacifier. She clutches the adorable stuffed monkey like it is a life saver, and believe me, it is!!!
My baby's favorite pacifiers since he was a newborn. Great fit - and like that is comes with 4 because all pacifiers are easy to lose.
i purchased these for my daughter to use when drying her face after washing. they make great facial clothes, because they are so soft.
this chair is great to store flat for when the grandbaby comes.  it does not take up much space and it works really well on our table.
best bib we ever had.  it locks in place so my boy can't take it off anymore by himself.  easy to clean and catches a lot of food too!
love this!!. we got one for my daughter when she was born. she still loves hers, 2 years later. we knew we had to get one for our son!
Our child likes these pacifiers very much.  He has never needed to try any others, so I can't comment on them compared to some others.
This is our second kitty, my baby loves it so much we needed two.  She has no problem putting it in her own mouth or sleeping with it.
Great natural alternative to the silicone pacifier; comfortable fit that baby seems to prefer in comparison to other brands. Recommend
These are our favorite. My son took the the infant size immediately after birth after trying several others, so we've stuck with them.
this is the only paci my daughter would use in the 1st months. very easy to clean. may not be the cutest looking but does a great job.
Our son love this! Great pacifier shape for a newborn, and he can easily take it out when he is done. And you can't lose these easily!
Our two boys loves these. Only problem with it is that our older boy steals the younger's passy since he can see it in the dark now :)
My son loves these. He takes other pacifiers but doesn't keep them in as well as he does this one. I'm so glad I decided to try these.
very nice bid set.  the quality is great and it's easy to pack up and take with you.  messes are much less messy with this!  i love it.
Oh yeah, these are a winner.    We just run them thru the dishwasher every now and then   on the sanitizing cycle.  Works like a charm.
this wet bag is super cute, and it seems to be doing its job well. i've only washed it a few times, so i can't speak to its durability.
I have a set of newborn twins... We received these as a gift and out of the many pacifiers that we have received we only use these two.
this mattress fits perfect in the pack and play and is firm enough to have our angelcare monitor sit underneath it.  very good mattress
Excellent, the best! I love this cute toy with huge eyes! My grandson always with this Wubbanub Owl!  Looks very adorable!!! Thank you!
i bought this for my 3month old and our pacifier problems are over!!!  it works perfect and is much better looking than all the others.
i got pink foot. and my lo is good with it. he doesn't have problem to grab it. i guess i can say my lo satisfied with this purchase :)
it comes with all these bags that are labeled to keep everyone organized. plus a blanket and pillow. i love this for the daycare to use
made mom and my life alot easier, kept baby in a safe position he could not roll off, save on our back as we did not have to bent over.
Couldnt live without these. Very nipple like which is great! They do tend to feel sticky sometimes but they are awesome. We have three!
My family and I love these pacifiers because they are all one piece. They are, sanitary, easy to clean, no hard pieces and all natural.
Very cute and durable. Great for infants at night because they are easy to find. My daughter is almost a year old and still loves hers.
this works perfectly with my medela pump. i love that the flange is one piece so there is less to wash! i would recommend this product!
This is a good purchase for the long run, because one pack is never enough, and they're a little pricey to buy only one pack at a time.
i was not familiar with alva and had always bought &#34;name-brand&#34; diapers, but i was pleased with this diaper! i will order more!
Although he liked the soothie from the hospital, it wouldn't stay in. The MAM stays in until he's ready to spit it out...or he sneezes!
love the car seat cover it looks great and fits on the car seat perfectly. baby hasn't arrived yet but it looks like it will work well.
Very cute and very funny to look at. Gave it to my nephew and I take photos of him every time my sister would suck this into his mouth.
great quality product. i am very satisfied with this product. i meant to order a darker stain but am glad that i ended up with the oak.
my son loved it , it's soft and easy to grab , i hoped for blue or green one and we got lucky with the green one. i would recommend it/
got this for my wife after the birth of our twins and she loved it. highly recommended. it is the perfect size, and looks great on her!
good ones!!!!! out of five children i when something a BIG hit and this one came out on top!  we bought every one they had at the store
The product complied with the characteristics described on the site. The material is soft and allows to keep the baby calm when placed.
My grandchildren love these Pacifiers and so does my daughter. They are practically never lost. Would buy again and suggest to friends.
this car seat was purchased to be used for our grandchildren when they come to town.  it is great for that purpose. the price is right.
great teether and toy.  i don't agree with the doggie toy comments, it's better quality than that.  so what it squeaks, kids love that.
these are the only pacifier my son would take as an infant. now he is a year and a half and still refuses any other pacifier but these.
Both of my little ones loved these as newborns. I've bought so many of them because I keep on losing them. I give them as shower gifts.
my little one has loved the site and sounds of this mobile since the first time she saw it! perfect for on the go or in her bassinet :)
This is a great buy. Our baby only wants these and won't take any other pacifier. they are excellent quality and certainly recommended.
such a cute sheet for such a great price. designer sheets are 20-30 bucks a piece and thus one us just as cute! perfect for my nursery.
for the price, this lunchbag is worth it.  its cute, fun and your child will love it.  holds just the right amount of food for a child.
Love this mustachifier of which i also bought a tuxedo onesie to go with it when the parents needed a must dresses outfit. Really cool.
And it's so much better than the &#34;first years&#34; one with the same name! Light weight and easier for my boy to keep in his mouth.

Was purchased for expecting parents who love mustaches and good laughs!!  Completely obsessed with mustaches, this makes a great gift!!
these are great.  fun for our kids, convenient to have around the house and less costly than continually buying the disposable pouches.
Baby loves the pacifier and does not reject it at all. Seems to fit beautiful face perfectly great company and good choice in pacifiers
Quick shipment, item as described.  GREAT during those rough teething months.  My daughter never took a paci but loved chewing on this!
These are great and my son loves his. Easy for them to hold and to find! I just throw them in the washing machine and they are clean :)
i can't wait to see the new model to include the feeding tube and buckle strap. i won't ever have to interact with my child ever again.
Essential baby product! My son loves to play with the little dog while sucking on the soothie. Easily to clean with mild soap and water.
My daughter is two months old and the wubbanub is a life saver. It's easy for her to hold on to and I adore watching her cuddle with it.
Very happy with this.  Looks better in person than it does in the photos.  Love how his little mustache bobs when he sucks on the binky.
My son loves this product. He can not put it down, and it helps because it never gets lost.  Now my sister wants one for her kid as well
this cup is adorable. my son loves just holding onto the cup when he plays.<br /><br />i received this product in exchange for a review.
My daughter absolutely loves her monkey!  It is perfect for using in the car seat because it stays in!  It's definitely worth the price!
i couldn't believe this product was as cheap as it said. i thought it would tear or be defective. it's a great product worth your money.
how great that fisher price made a replacement seat cushion for the deluxe space saver high chair.  very nicely made and washes up well.
great pacifier and toy for my baby who enjoys playing with her pacifier. keeps her calm and quiet. had one previous and had to get more.
We have used these pacifiers for several little ones & they are definitely our favorite pacifiers. The babies were very happy with them!
My son loves this even before he could grab his binki he liked looking at the cow and keeps his binki from getting lost under his bottom
Tried Avent soothies, and baby didn't care for them at all  than Mam, baby liked much better, than tried Nuk and these were her favorite
Absolutely loved them!!!  My little boy absolutely who is 5 months old really loves it. The pacifer attachment is a real life saver too!
My baby's theme is giraffe and I am sooo in love with this! I want to buy more just because they are so cute and tiny for little babies!
Got this along wih the Giraffe Bestever Baby Mat and both were very well received by the happy new parents. Nice quality and super cute!
i appreciate it! very helpful!i love it! btw glass bottels is much better than other matearial bottles!it's very important! remember it!
me encanta este producto y todo entregado en el momento acordado satisfactorio la compra y el envio recomendado totalmente buen vendedor
expensive - yes, but lasts for days. the hospital gave me a free sample and i loved it. really helped with the pain and healing process.
When my daughter used this beautifull pacifier she looks amaizing, not only that but its really comfortable in her mouth. I recomend it.
These are the cutest pacifiers for our little grandson!!  Great quality and great price!!  Definitely will buy more!! Highly recommend!!
our son likes to play with this because it makes a little rattle noise.  he doesn't really chew on it but he sure likes to play with it.
My daughter loves Wubbanub period! She holds them close for security and when she's awake she holds onto the pacifier and plays with it.
If you love your team as much as I love the cubs, then you will get this for your baby. So they can grow up loving the same team you do!
I have 9 month old twins and these are the ONLY nuks that one of them will take. I only wish they came in all pink or more girly colors.
the blocks are great for stacking, chewing, crinkling, shaking, etc.<br />my son loves them. the colors and pictures grab his attention.
i love this! it's so soft! i wish i had one of these sheets for my bed. my little man likes to rub his face on it while he falls asleep.
We own many wubbas and this is by far the cutest! We love wubbas they are big so we never loose them and our daughter can always find it

we purchased this warmer when my son was born 4 years ago and are now using it for my daughter. we've been very pleased with this warmer.
These are the only paci's my baby will take...she is completely breastfed and these do not confuse her. I will recommend these to anyone.
Love knowing that it's all one piece. My baby really likes this pacifier. We tried several different kinds, but she only wanted this one.
my baby got into everything until i found these, now they're everywhere- cabinets, drawers, on trash cans- and my life is so much easier.
i am now a great-grandmother and this book was everything i hopped for.  now if my granddaughter will fill it out--kids these day.  ha ha

This was perfect for our little guy. They are just like the pacifiers in the hospital. Smells like vanilla! Very calming and easy to use.
Big  LSU fans so was VERY please to find a tiger wubbanub for friend of mine having her baby in August. She was Thrilled! Great purchase!
two age spots on my face have disappeared after using this product for over a year now. it absorbs into the skin, feels nice, not greasy.
The only pacifiers my son will use. No idea why they are so hard to get. They really are great for breast fed babies. No nipple confusion
His parents and I all loved this little cross with the Guardian Angel on the top.  I know it will be something he cherishes all his life.
Bought this for my preemie grandson who is in the NICU ... huge hit.. every one loves it in his pictures.. and of course he does too.. :)
you know the giraffe i'm talking about... this is just as good for a fraction of the price. the squeaker is loud though, you were warned!
i think this very good baptism gift.i bought it for nephew of my husband. this frame for picture looks no cheap. good price,good quality.
my grandaughter loves this on her wall she recently got her own room and now it is all decorated in paris love love love this on the wall
Darling pacifier!  It is functional as well as precious!  I think every little, &#34;Princess In Training&#34; should have this pacifier!
just what you need if you need replacement parts. i personally didn't need as many &#34;caps,&#34; but everything else has come in handy.
This was a shower gift for a true Cowboy fans first baby! He Loved It !!! It was a real crowd pleaser and seems to please the baby too !!
it is just right for my needs to keep an ear on the kids. lasts good and battery works great!! it is clear and the volume switch is good.

i got this for my grandson to play with while i feed him. he loves it. it figured out how to make it spin around. happy with my purchase.
Took the baby a bit to adjust to this pacifier. It's longer than most, but very very soft. He loves it now to help him sleep most nights.
Was a baby shower gift. She went crazy over this thing. It was the one  thing that she really wanted. She was screeching when she saw it.
cute and cleverly folded card. perfect for baby shower thank you notes. i wish there were more notecards similar to this one. hint, hint.
best feature ... silverware is very safe for toddlers, nice rounded points on fork. cup is well balanced; easy to handle and hard to tip!
totally awesome product any baby would love this great value for money and helps soothe difficult babies that find it hard to self soothe
Unlike the traditional pacifiers these are always easy to find, they won't roll away. Soft and Adorable!  I would highly recommend these.
This is the only brand that we will purchase! My son loves them and I love that I can trust this brand. Also they have such cute designs!
arrived quickly, perfect condition, and perfect fit. great for strollers, car seats, etc. especially for cloth diaper wearing little ones
he loves to cuddle with it and is proud to carry it with him.<br />we switch it tot he front then he pretends he  is carrying a real dog.
love them easy fit to the nuk bottle and great step to change from newborn nibbles to spout and not hard to change and thank you so much.
looks excellent, very good eye catcher, and durable. my little one is now 20 months and loves to look at the ocean animals on the sheets.
Kind of a gag gift but I bought this for my younger sister after she announced her pregnancy and she loved it. Lots of laughs all around.
this mattress was the perfect solution to increase comfort for times when our baby sleeps in the pack n play.  excellent fit and quality.
Baby boy loves it. When he starts to cry, I put it in his mouth and that will calm him down. The little tiger and frog are just too cute!
for a toddler who is crazy for angry birds, this is a great present! how about more stuff--play figures, playsets, puzzles, kitchen, etc.
Adorable! Love this item. My baby loves it as well. :) it's a friend, a toy, and a pacifier all it one! Love the dragon. It's super cute.
My daughter and her husband really got a kick out of this, and anyone who sees it has a good chuckle. It even works ... most of the time.
This is awesome and helps sooth my baby.. helps it go to sleep. I like that the pacifier is similar to the one that the hospital gives us.
absolutely the best jogger stroller i have used and is not bulky for storage in your car.  easy to fold, take apart and put back together.
my daughter loves this backpack! we were so happy with it we ordered the same one for her cousin. it's the perfect size for 2-5 year olds.
This brand was recommended by our lactation consultant and seem to do a good job of soothing our son without causing any nipple confusion.
Love these! I am hoping my #3 will love this soft lil' dog! I used one for my #2, but he didn't use it much. Just the right size for baby.
Who knew the shape of the pacifier really matters.  Especially for infants, the shape allows them to suck without their nose being smashed
We absolutely love our Elle it is the cutest thing ever! Great product!  Would definitely recommend, if your baby likes smoothie pacifiers
I just recently ordered and received this for my son and he loves it. I wish I would have known about these 2 months ago when he was born.
My newborn needed a pacifier that was a little larger than normal to keep in her mouth and these worked great. Cheaper than the store too!
Very easy for my little guy to hold in place and very<br />Cute.  I love these products.  Have loved all the ones<br />I ordered thus far.
looked all over for a pad to replace the one that came on my daughter's bed/changing table combo.  price and shipping were very agreeable!
Our baby loves the vanilla flavor pacifiers! For whatever reason these are his favorite type/ brand. Good product and I would recommend it
my daughters favorite blanket. i had to buy a second one as back up since it snags pretty easily but it's a great little princess blanket.
My son loves the Wubbanub!  It's so easy for him to grab and put back in his mouth. And it's easy to keep track of!  And they are so cute!
My baby loves this pacifier and i'm pleased that she does it really comforts and soothes her so no fuss for her and no headache for mommy.
My son loves all the wubbanubs he has. They are very convenient for me as well because they are easier to find then the regular pacifiers.
my 3 month old baby girl simply just love them, ever since she got these she kept on playing with them in and out of her mouth constantly.
this product is excellent. it fits the mouth of the baby, without squeezing or hurting, is very light and the inner small and anatomically
It is a safe material. I wll recommend it to anyone with babies. Beside that t was hilarious.  We had a lot of laugh out of this pacifier.
This is a lifesaver; especially during the newborn stages. It keeps the pacifier in place and keeps you from searching for lost pacifiers!
wish it was all pink.  we can't get these locally in the small size in pink.  bummer.  these are ok and I'm glad they were an add on item.
Love these because at night they glow in the dark when the baby wakes up screaming. And sometimes he can find it himself because it glows.
We love this bedding!!! My daughter wanted to do something different in her son's nursery so we went with camo and John Deere and love it.
Matches the JJ Cole diaper bag; easily holds 2 pacifiers; wipes clean; closes easy and attaches to any bag. Meets all expectations. Enjoy!
I bought these for my grandson who is just 1 year old. These are cute, durable and easily washable and best of all my grandson likes them.
Amazing, my son holds onto this thing better than any other pacifier, he loves it, and it has actually helped his motor skills develop!!!!
i pirchased this decal almost two years ago and, i have to say that they are still lovely.<br />very on place as well very easy to put on.
These are the only pacifiers my breastfed son will take.  I think the shape is easier for breastfed babies' mouths to make the transition.
it is so good that i actually bought two. i kept one at bedroom and another one in living... good product, serves the purpose pretty well.
BEST ITEM IVE EVER BOUGHT for my baby... she cant live without it. super soft and stays on her chest when the paci slips out of her mouth.
i went back and forth on this purchase because of the price, but i couldn't be happier with it! beautiful art and perfect for the nursery.
the hilarity of it is enough to make the purchase, but the look on my sister in laws face when I gave to them for my nephew was priceless.
fits perfectly on my mini cooper countryman's seats perfectly.  prevents my munchkin from destroying my seats.  seems tough and well made.
got this for grandbaby for christmas. i am sure she will love it. this is her first christmas. can wait to see her face when she opens it.
for the newest texans fans, this teether gets the job done while letting everyone know that &#34;this baby is a texans fan&#34; go texans!
Good product for a good price, with 2 pacifier! My baby like it! My baby boy likes to hold the pacifier with his owns hands so is anatomic
i got this for my son when he was a year old.  he's 2 1/2 and still loves it.  i've bought it for other's for gifts too.  it's a good one.
It does smell like rubber which I dislike, however it's worth it for her to have a rubber pacifier vs a plastic one filled with chemicals.
me and my boyfriend love the quality shipping was really fast it was easy to put together and it was purchased at an extremely good deal!!
was excited to get.  it and was not  disappointed.  very cute and lots of good information to write in!<br />i would buy it as a gift too.
i have every teething toy... i have bought dozens. literally.  and finally my baby boy enjoys this one, right out of the package!  hooray!
this window dressing is adorable.  the colors are vibrant and bold and the quality is great.  a perfect addition to our zebra print decor.
Excellent product.  I bought these for my first granddaughter ... now for  my 2nd granddaughter.<br />Great quality ... I would buy again.
I lovethis it look great and I love the price and fast service!!! I am very happy and recommend it to everybody as a gift for a little boy
fast shipping and i love this jogger. it's so comforable and not as heavy as my regular stroller. fits easily in the back of my car too :)
my 2 year old loves this pillow! all though he takes the pillow case off every night. it's still a perfect little pillow for my toddler ;)
Best introduction to sports for a baby.  Loved the product<br />It was exactly has advertised.  I would give this as a gift again and again
much better than the suction based ones. also safer that the retractable ones and more stable than regular ones.<br />quite good for money.
These are the only pacifiers that my daughter will use! They also used these in the hospital.  They are shaped to prevent nipple confusion.
i used one of these when my son was little and loved it...so i found this one for my grandson...all i can say is love it love it love it...
My son would not take any other pacifier this the first one he will actually use. Love the openness so he doesn't get red around his mouth.
i use the photo album for flash card for my son and picture that he will know. i love the photo album. i bought a perfect album for my son.
love these bottles and they are so easy to use! love the filtration system in the bottles to keep the air from going into the babies tummy.
My son (between birth and 1 year) and now my infant both had/have only used this brand.  I have tried others, but they only like this kind.
This is a great starting set for any new born.  My wife loves MAM and having four bottles and soothers in a single package is a great deal!
the crib mattress was a perfect for the crib. i feel very comfortable that my grandbaby will sleep comfortably and safely on this mattress.
This infant pacifier meets and exceeds all of my wishes. Easy for a baby to hold and makes it easy to find it when misplaced. Quality made.
I got one of these pacifiers in the 0 months+ size free with the Chicco Keyfit 30 carseat. Of course it is the only pacifier my baby likes.
Not only is she a fan of the soothie pacifier, but she also likes the frog attached to it.  It gives her something additional to play with!
I love this pacifier holder, it's easy to attach to any bag, stroller... And binky is always at fast reach for crying baby, very practical.
Bought for my grandson as a baby shower gift and this is his favorite pacifier and wont take anything else.  Light weight and easy to find.
i never thought i would actually need one of these but the concept is perfect  and we have actually used it already. bette safe than sorry!
My baby boy loves these pacifiers! They were the easiest ones for him to keep in his mouth and to find in his crib. He's never looked back!
used this to add a special funny touch to a baby shower diaper cake. Now that the baby is born, looked so funny and cute on him! Great buy!
I love these pacifiers! They are like the soothie only a little firmer and they don't block the baby's nose. Good for a baby over 3 months.
These little friends will save your life at 2 in the morning when your daughter/son cannot find their Pacifier...Wash well..very durable...
Love this chair. Easy to assemble. Convenient. Tons of compliment from non-parents about how cool the chair is when we are at a restaurant.
my daughter played with these when she was a baby all the time.  can be used for different purposes from toy to hanging things on her pram.
perfect compliment to go with pillow. extremely soft and comfortable!! my wife loved it and was able to sleep so much better while pregnant
Best pacifiers out there!! I don't have to worry about my newborn falling asleep with any hard plastic or hitting her face on a hard piece.
i wish i found this teether sooner, it's perfect. i love how small it is, easy to clean, and my baby loves it. also, the price is good too.
Just...omg my niece looks hilarious with this. Lots of curious looks from people!! But my niece loves it!! Definitely will purchase again!!
My son absolutely LOVED this pacifier. I wish I knew about it with my other two kids! It is so adorable & easier to find for me & the baby!
if you are lucky to find this available grab it! it is almost impossible to find very cute and goes great with the eddie bauer bedding set.
I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for one of the best baby gifts ever!!! It is practically impossible to lose this pacifier!!
Simply, babies love these and they become their comfort toy and a must for parents. My daughter hated giving hers up as she was growing up.
so far we love it. it looks just like the picture. it took me over an hour, maybe closer to 2 to assemble with a drill. feels pretty study.
Arrived fast. And this product really calm my baby down. He doesn't use it often. I like it but every baby is different. I would recommend.
So cute! And they are perfect fit and feel. Great value and wonderful gift idea! I wish they had more colors, because I would buy them all!
Super quick shipping! Bought as a shower gift, and the parents LOVED it! Would def reccomend this to anyone who wants something 'different'
these are the best pacifiers on the market! they are flared at the top and bottom so they dont push into the babys nose or chin. love them!
i sent this to my brand new great grandson.  i am an elephant collector and enjoyed the novelty of finding a special one to share with him.
I can't find these in the store anymore.  My first child loved them, only one she would take.  I am hoping they work for the one on the way
Best bobo's ever. Theyre not sold in stores anynore. This was my son's favorite and is now my daughter's favorite as well (4 years later!).
i purchased this for my niece who was expecting her first child. she loves this bag, large enough for all of her baby's needs but not bulky.
Wubbanubs are the best!  My little one has about 20, and they are both pacifiers and toys.  I don't know what we would do without wubbanubs!
bought this as a gift but have used chicco for my daughter and will for son. super easy to use and love the safety stats on these as well!!!
used this at my doctors office and fell in love! came home and ordered one right away! boppy pillow went in the trash as soon as this came!!
This is the most ADORABLE addition to my little man EVER. He is so cute with it in his mouth def worth the money for all the pictures alone.
Amazing binky! Just like the one they gave us at the hospital, it's the only kind our baby will take. I think the vanilla scent is soothing.
This is one of the few pacifiers my son liked.  This makes a great baby shower gift.  Try pairing it with the children's book Mustache Baby.
my daughter is having her first baby and everybody recommended this item. the baby will be born in oct but, in the meantime, it seems great.
holds bottles of all sizes, has straps for extra support, it's great all around and i really truly love it. get this bra. you wont regret it
i love this pump. it works great and i love the design of the shield and how it kinda massages the breast. its very easy and quick to clean.
my 6 month old grandson loves this giraffe, whether he is chewing on it or smacking it around to make it squeak, it's very durable and soft.
My child loves it and it is super easy to wash and for him to find it when he wakes up at night; which translated in more sleep for parents!
These are amazing! My baby loves this brand the style everything! They're easy to clean and find because of their colors! Highly reccommend!
Love the Wubbanub and so does my baby. When not in his mouth he likes to hold the monkey. I am planning on giving one to my pregnant friend.
after searching for baby books this was the best fit and match for our son. the book has alot of options and was a perfect mothers day gift!
works great to keep my daughter's car seat clean when we travel. has a convenient handle and easily folds into a small pouch when not in use
I am very pleased with this sweet little binky buddy, and so is my baby girl. She has 3 wubbanubs, and Jasmine Giraffe is by far the cutest.
This was the only passi by baby would take! Love it. It's easy for them to put in and good for a 12 month plus age! Nice and durable as well
This item was shipped just as cute as it was pictured online and I already told new mothers to purchase it cause I work in a hospital thanks
This is sooo cute!!! My daughter started outgrowing the pacifier shortly after receiving this but I loved it the few times I got to use it!!
My son loves his monkey Wubbanub. Everyone comments about it, but mostly he can easily find it in his crib or diaper bag.  A great purchase.
seals the bottle every time.  keeps the milk where it should be.<br /><br />unlike there freezer bags.  that is an entirely different story.
using these along with belly bands really extended my regular wardrobe further into my pregnancy.  i recommend these to all expectant moms!!
I ordered these because they are the pacifiers they give the babies in the hospital. They arrived on time and i am pleased with the product.
this was just what i needed for my grandbaby. easy to assemble and fold down but imposible to put back in it's bag. otherwise it is perfect.
Like most of avent products, these ones do the work well. No complaints.would be better if you can choose colors, design, but not a big deal
like these better the the bumkins. they're the perfect size and they lay flat, which is great when you have a squirmy 8-month-old who won't.
these are nice tools for portion control in my ongoing quest to limit what i eat.  they are pretty too, and the lids snap on and off easily.
Absolutely love these. These are what the NICU provided for my preemie and they are the absolute best. I love that they come in cute colors!
my granddaughter loves the ducks! she has begun to collect them and loves making videos with them. these ducks have been carried everywhere.
these washcloths are very soft, well made.  they dry quickly, the colors and prints are different.  smell nice while drying, no mildew odor.
used these to announce our pregnancy to our parents on xmas eve.  total hit! this was the perfect way to tell our family.  highly recommend.
beautiful and well made! it fit my daughter, who was 4 1/2 months old at the time, comfortably without leaving marks. perfect for christmas!
this is such an awesome thing to have during potty training!  brilliant, diono.  it is super easy to install and fits the carseat perfectly.
Fantastic Product! We have had this for several months and the overall quality is outstanding. Excellent picture, features and battery life.
Very handy.  I like that it holds two. Easier to clean than fabric pacifier carriers. And at this price you can buy several to have on hand.
great bids if your baby is like a st. bernard! it has the plastic on the inside of the terry cloth so it wont run onto your babies clothing.
Our dog chewed our old one so we bought a new one. Its really soft and its pretty big to help keep it in place so the baby doesn't loose it.
very portable. very strong. and very light at the same time. my daughter loves it. i bought two. i am glad it is part of my daughter's life.
good product that was described accurately.  this was a present to my husband the bears fan of the house.  fun to see in baby girl's mouth!!
Great for one pacifier.  I attach it  to the car seat and it stays put.  It's easy to clean and I love it.  It's my favorite pacifier holder
I Would Always Drop The Pacifier And Have To Dispose Of Them But Now It Stays Protected! Such A Clever Idea For Mothers And Never Gets Lost!
It is so, so cute!!  What a great way to keep the pacifier in view and not losing it.  It was for a gift, and the parents just loved it too.
This is the only pacifier that would stay in my grown son's mouth, when he was a baby.  His grandson took after him.  Best pacifier ever : )
my grandson loved him, to manipulate sound due to the material they are made, so it was a success! is an excellent present that i recommend!
actually my daughter loves it.  it does exactly what is needed, where it is needed.  easily keeps my granddaughter safely out of harm's way.
Parents everywhere will be using this to break the paci addiction. Just add bitter medicine and in no time, your toddler will fear the paci!
i love this changing pad so much.  i used it for my kids, then bought it for friends as well.  it keeps it's form well and is easy to clean.
Thank you for fast & easy service. Purchased as a shower gift & I know they'll be appreciated. Product is as described. Very happy with all.
i got this for the pack and play that i ordered and really liked that the sheet was padded!  my daughter in law said she had never seen one!
5 stars because it is hard to mess up plastic play balls. quality plastic and perfect size for play pools or bin. kids love playing in them.
what can you say it works like it's suppose to. i'm suppose to take up some more space with words so blah blah blah we love it we really do.
we both bottle feed and breastfeed my son. he transitions easily with this bottle. we use the slow flow nipples and are very happy with them.
I bought this before my Grandson was born.  This, out of all his pacifiers is his favorite.  He holds on to it when he is asleep for comfort.
The gift was well received by the parents and the young man will not go to sleep without it.  A great gift and everyone who sees it loves it.
My baby loves these.  They fit great and are good quality.  The glow in the dark feature isn't really that important, but it is kind of cool.
looks nice and very functional, easy to place. fits various sized doorways. keeps my dog and cat out of rooms to help keep them allergy free.
What a great idea to attach a toy to a pacifier. I was up multiple times at night to fetch for my daughters pacifier, this saved the problem.
I used at a house party and the conversation they started got me laid 3 times. may just be the confidence the stache brings out in you though
My daughter got this pacifier from the hospital and loves it. So I ordered spares for the diaper bag and around the house. Excellent product.
Everything went fine. My baby was crying all night and this was the solution for her. Are small for her mouth. She really likes this pacifier
love these bibs.. great coverage, easy to put on/take off, lightweight, and easy to clean!  and cute patterns :) what more can a mom ask for?
mirror is great! it is huge which means a lot easier to see you little one. super adjustable and sturdy. beats all other mirrors we have had!
great replacement tubes for my pump. i haven't had any issues and i've had these for a year now. i would buy them again when the need arises.
The elephant wubbanub is perfect for every little girl. it's always easy to find and is easy for the kiddos to hold on to. I would recommend.
This was my son's favorite pacifier! I am not sure if t was because it was his pacifier or the attention he got when he had it out in public!
My baby never took to pacifiers which was a real bummer. I can't tell you pros and cons but I gave it 5 stars because it's still really cute.
We bought it for our daughter right after we came home from the hospital, where we got one of these for free. It really is the best pacifier!
my son takes it to be with him every night. he is 2. he can turn in on him self and it he forgets to turn it off, it turns off in 30 minutes.
this was for my grandson and it was absolutely the hit of his christmas gifts.  absolutely adorable.  soft and cuddly.  so glad i ordered it.
I turned them into ornaments for my expecting co-worker. She loved them. Cute, affordable. Would definitely buy again for another sports fan.
soft and sweet! the perfect little hooded bath towel. i only wish they had matching washcloths! that's the only thing that needs improvement!
Loved these, and baby did too. Everyone wants to know about them and where to get them... will<br />be great for Halloween, highly recommend.
perfect way to get my grandson going in baseball he will become a true dodger fan with his grandma. goes perfect with the dodger pacifer clip
We Love our wubbanubs, they are perfect! Very easy to keep up with and stylish! We always get compliments on how cute she looks holding them!
This is the same brand used by the hospital where our children were born.  Perfect.  This is exactly what we wanted in lovely feminine colors
My Grandson was attached to his first Brown Puppy so much I figured he would need a back-up in case puppy got lost. He loves the new one too!
love this back pack. it's cute factor is off the charts. it fits my 2yr old niece perfectly. i really like that it has a buckle on the front.
Baby is 10 weeks old and prefers this pacifier over 3 other brands we've bought.  And it comes in a 6 pack, which you will lose 2 right away!
We have several Wubbanubs. They have become one of my daughter's favorite things in the world. They are the perfect size for her little hands.
They work great and give you a few moments to yourself.  Newborns need to suck and sometimes moms need a break.  This is the perfect solution.
My son got used to this binky while he was in the NICU after he was born.  I couldn't find them at any stores, but was able to find them here!
i love these! they not only come in cute designs and colors but these are the only binkys my baby would ever take! i'm so thankful for them :)
i am extremely happy with the hippo organizer. it is the third organizer i am buying and finely this one is just perfect. my son loves it too.
it came folded up, and i would've preferred it rolled up in a tube to avoid creases, but it still stuck on the wall very well and looks great!
I bought this for a gift, so I am not sure if the baby actually will use it.  It was funny for the new mom to open and well worth the giggles.
i purchased the ergo options carrier just so i could have the option to change the covers. this set is really cute and i can't wait to use it!
these are great! easy to remove or put back on.  my 3 year old loves to take them down to look out the window and put them up when it's sunny.
it does the job! and it doesn't matter what type of pacifier you use. i use it with the soothie...but it could be used with any type, i think!
thx i like the stuff that i just ordered it was perfect with good quality n the service was amazing n it arrived at the exactly time thx a lot
thx i like the stuff that i just ordered it was perfect with good quality n the service was amazing n it arrived at the exactly time thx a lot
I bought this partly for the fun aspect not expecting my baby to like it. I let him look at himself in the mirror and he was laughing nonstop!
Great price, awesome buy. It's much more affordable to buy this three pack then one at a time... plus I can't even handle how cute they are :)
It's soft and the perfect size for my son to hold. He loves it and it helps him sleep. Great snuggle size too when he's not using the passie:)
i bought this for a new mommy.  her husband has told me that this is the best gift of all the baby gifts.  it got rave reviews from the user!!
They may be hard to find when you loose them by my son loves these pacifiers the best! And I like that they are clear so they match any outfit
So cute and worth the money - my daughter hates regular pacifiers and these are the only ones she likes plus she can hold onto the little lamb
These rock! Glow in the dark pacifiers are the way to go. If you don't  have any you should try them. No more turning the light on to find it.
Son loves these soothies. We try to only give him the pacifier when he is so mad that we can't calm him down with walking/rocking/songs etc...
Although my daughter didn't take to these (we have the cow too) at first,  now that she can more easily grasp onto it herself, she loves them.
We used these pacifiers pretty heavily from 4 wks old to 3.5 months.  Now he has self weaned down to use them only when trying to fall asleep.
I bought this for a baby shower gift. It was perfect since it's not a common product to find in stores. It was a hit and I'm glad I bought it.
In the picture looks much bigger than in reality but I think it is a perfect size for baby.  Gliders does not look as it shown in the picture.
the little spiders float, and so happy to have found something safe for my son for the bath without all the bad stuff. he loves catching them!
As soon as I saw this I thought it was too funny and cute not to mention accuate. LOL It even came with a pacifier protector to keep it clean.
My babe loves these pacifiers anyway... but one day my husband says, someone should invent glow in the dark pacifiers Presto! Amazon finds it!
Both my kids loved this brand.  They don't yank them out like other brands and can still hold on to the pacifier to put it in their own mouth.
twins are not yet born - but the item is perfect compared to one having to be in front and one in back (not a fan of those) and easier to use!
we have tried several diaper pail liners and this is by far my favorite brand.  we use this liner in the ubbi pail.  we always hang it to dry.
i feel safer having it on the faucet since once my granddaughter slipped in the tub and hit the faucet and busted her lip! awesome transaction
it's a great little seat.  very sturdy and easy to travel with.  plus, it's very secure and safe... no other seat can restrain my 2yr old boy.
works great, look fine in the kitchen, easy to clean.  holds ample amount of items, different bottles all fit fine and nothing has fallen off.
I use these for my baby because they have lots of strength so he can really bite down, they last, and they are made of natural rubber. Thanks!
Really cute & my grandson loves it. I love it because it doesn't get lost as easily as other pacifiers & he can hold onto it & find it easily.
Cute, durable, washable, and fits easily into little hands. Also, very difficult to lose! I get a lot of compliments on these and own 3 total.
I love this brand of pacifier! My The sanitizing box is a huge plus. My baby seems to like this style better than the &#34;standard&#34; ones.
this is the second of this product. we are still using this for our son in us. my wife gifted a second one for her niece. they also love this.
My son-in-law is a Yankee fan otherwise I would have purchased Orioles.  Of course after 14 years of losing mabey Yankees was a better choice.
Absolutely love! My Lil nephew adores it. Can't get it out of his grip. Super easy to find if he does drop it or if mommy n daddy set it down.
i have video on youtube of her playing with this toy, she's six months old, and she loves it. she got the biggest smile when i gave it to her.
I bought these for my new nephew and his Mom and Dad really liked them!  I didn't use them personally but they make a great gift of super fans!
it is easy to assemble and weights practically nothing! we love it and are really happy we chose this one instead of another car travel system.
these work as expected. we had some already and just ordered more. my son who is into everything isn't able to break them off, so that's a win!
These are THE best pacifiers to soothe new babies. Besides getting a pacifier they have a soft toy to hold - nicer than a pacifier on a string.
although these are pricy, they are worth their weight in gold! love the colors, ease of use and safety was the main issue. recommend to anyone!
Best pacifier ever - my grandson can easily find it at night in his crib if he wakes up. And it's a baby dragon. How much more can you ask for?
this is the only sippy i've found that actually works! the valve has to be replaced after a few months, but you can buy refills easily. hurray!
these are great diapers to fold and lay in a diaper cover.  no snappi necessary!  as my daughter continues to grow i will use them as doublers.
my 4 week old grandson loves this toy...the music, the lights, the bright colors really gets his attention, and soothes him.  highly recommend.
i ordered this when i was still pregnant and it was super easy to put together! it looks and is amazing. soft and cushiony for my little angel.
i use these regularly around the house for random things.  i have one on a pump in my laundry room that controls a pump in the ro/di container.
Nuk bottles and pacifiers are the ONLY brand my daughter likes. Easy to clean, I highly recommend trying them. Of course, the designs are cute.
My baby loves these...She was never a fan of the Avent which I bought for her at first. She cannot put down these pacifiers. They are too cute.
My daughter loooooves this giraffe paci :) she doesn't sleep without it. Very quick shipping and is exactly what the pictures shows. Thank you!
This is my sons absolute favorite pacifier and mine too... Easy to locate in the dark in the middle of the night and extremely stylish and cute
a great, simple, and convenient way to track baby's firsts.  i love the stickers and the cute photos of the animals. it makes a great keepsake!
these are the best. my kids use them every weekday at day care and sometimes at home on weekends too. have held up beautifully wash after wash.
glad i got this.  i fit two nuk pacifiers in this for my son.  i throw it in my diaper bag and it's easy to find because of the nice red color.
Haven't used this yet as baby comes in Sept. but yhe idea is fantastic. I saw this on Shark Tank and ordered it while the episode was still on.
Best pacifiers I bought thus far. The can hold on to it at only 2 months old and she seems to only like these from all of the ones I purchased.
My baby has a cleft lip and this is the only pacifier she likes to use. It stays in her mouth the best. Plus, she likes to hold on to her lamb.
My little guy loves this pacifier.  It is easy for him to grab and put in his mouth.  It doesn't go bouncing across the floor when he drops it.
I looked everywhere for pictures like this for my daughters nursery and they are perfect! Thank you. I can't wait to hang them up on the walls.
we love this seat. we have a 2 1/2 year old and a 1 year old. we have it for both cars and the grandparents too. easy to put in and super safe!
love the ties that secure it to the rails.  they are longer then other brands i've bought and are also a bit stretchy making it so easy to tie.
Adorable - I purchased 3 for my granddaughter.  Haven't had to wash one yet but they look very durable and well made.  They are soooooooo cute.
used for my grandson during his training and then by a grand daughter two years later. sturdy quality made and children were confident with it.
Very useful for tethering toys to the high chair at restaurants and wherever.  Like that there are multiple snaps so you can adjust the length.
Love these. Keeps pacifiers clean and easy to locate in the diaper bag. I've never used the clip handle, so i'm not sure about it's durability.
These are great.  I wish every paci was glow in the dark.  Make it sooo much easier to find in the middle of the night when my baby looses his.
this cover has been awesome!  it has contained every mess.  after almost 5 months, we're just having to order the next size up for my daughter.
use it to keep cats in back bedroom area when necessary. works much better than the narrower ones i tried before, which they were able to open.
I love this product! My granddaughter uses the Avent pacifier and this is the only pacifier holder that works. I would  recommend this product!
Sent them to a friend that's a huge Alabama friend as an early baby gift. She doesn't know the gender, yet, but says she loves them either way.
nicely made.  its warm and cozy.  my daughter loves it.  probably going to end up with another one shortly.  highly recommend it during winter.
These are really wonderful.  However, they are $10 on lots of other sites including the gumdrop pacifier site and come with a gumdrop pacifier.
My grandson has so many of these he loves his little stuffed animals with the pacifiers. I think he has just about everyone that has been made.

love the Moustache on an eight month old. Received a good number of facebook likes on the photo. might grow a moustache myself so that we match
Love the durability and the quality. Its a great gift for the new baby girl in my life. I know these pacifiers will hold up thru her infanthood.
This is exactly what my baby needed. It's easy for her to hold the paci and friend. Much better than the other paci animal that is more popular.
a simple toy without batteries that my 11 month old plays with over and over. helps with his fine motor skilss and very colorful/fun and sturdy!
These are the only type of pacifier that my baby will take! They stay in his mouth really well compared to other brands we tried. He loves them.
Our grand son loves these wub a nubs he plays with the pet while it is in his mouth and  really calms him especially when he is in the car seat!
the toy exceeds my expectation.<br />my son enjoyed kicking at it.<br />both my wife and i think it is well worth the money if the kids love it.
one word...love! this bag is exactly what i needed. it's huge with tons of functional pockets. built well and comfortable. exactly as described!
My favorite pacifier. It's natural and it looks so cute. It's very light weight, I mention that because I thought it'd be heavy for some reason.
with two grandchilren, i wanted to find books that you can read to babies. ethan enjoyed this book and will more when he comes back for a vivst.
for the inconsolable baby, especially during the middle of the night, this item just might do the trick.  if they never get used, that's ok too.
Haven't been able to use these yet because the little one won't be here till February! But I know they are great products and will get much use!
i think all parent should get the  sing  for theist kids room  i know  i did  to reminder  her who  she  is and where  she is going in  her life
Pacifiers were as I expected them to be. Good price for a busy mom who can't always make it out to the store after the puppy eats another binky.
This is great! It helps keep the pacifier near baby's mouth, which is a lifesaver when driving. Our baby also loves playing with the toy monkey.
I bought these pacifiers for my niece after she was born and now my sister can't live without it.  So, I bought another!  She is attached to it!
We have 3 WubbaNubs, and I foresee many more in the future.  Our son loves holding onto the animals (we have the monkey, giraffe, and elephant.)
i still have a soft spot in my heart for all things winnie the pooh cudnt resist getting this adorable stuffed animal for my niece she loves it!
Tried other organic ones but out daughter loves this one.  Probably because of the texture as its on the softer side.<br />Definitely recommend!
great gift<br /><br />excellent quality, still being used like new 2 years later, i would recommened this product for new moms<br /><br />thanks
This has been great for our diaper bag! It fits 2 avent pacifiers and keeps them clean. I like that it is separate from other things in the bag!
these were recommended by our eating therapist to help my 8 month old move his tongue when he eats. we love them, too bad they are discontinued.
MAMs are the best pap-paps out there! If you're an inexperienced parent, do yourself and your baby a favor and buy nothing but MAMs from now on!

I used them to replace the pacifier on my son's Wubbanub. Worked great! Just used a thimble and it was easy enough to poke holes to see through.
Awesome gift.  Super cute and babies love to teeth on the frog's feet.  It's a cute plush, an awesome pacie and a teether.  It's 3 gifts in one.
these are great pacifiers. The design is child friendly  and cool. the only draw back is when you wash them sometimes water gets trapped inside.
This was the only paci one of my kids would take. Just had another little one a few days ago and he has already taken to this with zero issues馃槉
they stack nicely and are easy to open and close which is great, so often baby food containers are hard to open and close. these are a good buy.
This is the greatest thing ever invented for babies! It keeps the paci from popping out. My daughter is four months old and she loves her bunny!
ALL I CAN SAY IS THESE THINGS REALLY SUCK! THE BABY LOVES THEM! HOW MUCH HAPPINESS  CAN A LITTLE THING LIKE THIS BRING! IT IS TERRIFIC [I GUESS]
I like this dragon it's a good size and perhaps when my grand baby is a little older will be more attracted to it, it's a good size and colorful
this works great to keep my son in bed. he sits and waits for &#34;harry the bunny&#34; to wake up before he calls us to get out of bed.love it!
I haven't gotten to use it yet. Purchased for my future granddaughter. I believe both baby and mother will love. It looks exactly like the photo
very nice!  great way to store baby's pacifier! i bought it for my daughter-in-law and she liked it a lot.  it matched her diaper bag very well!
these are so soft. we are about to have our 5th baby and i ordered one of these to try. i wish i'd found them sooner! i will be purchasing more.
My 3 month old loves this!  She's teething and loves to work on it. No nipple confusion, just a quiet happy baby that let's mama do some chores!
These work the best for my babies. I breastfed and thus brand was the only ones they would take. They didn't experience nipple confusion either.
My son was given these in the hospital and he loves them. Love that they came five in a pack and were reasonably prices compared to babies r us.
Can't wait for my grand daughter to get her little hands on this one. She has most of them but laid them out for all of us to see.  She's a nut!
I love this thing! It keeps my son's paci clean while it is sitting in my diaper bag :) I would recommend this to any mommy who has a paci baby!
a cute and simple baby shower game that got many laughs! just know that it all comes on one sheet, so you must cut out the pacifiers beforehand.
thank goodness for this little bear, now when my daughter wakes in the night she can easily find her pacifier. wish i'd found this a lot sooner.
we absolutely love this booster seat! it doesn't slip (even with a toddler who never stops moving), it's a great height, and it's easy to clean.
I've tried other baby pacifier and for some reason baby couldn't seem to latch on to it; however, with this one he didn't have a problem at all.
Colors are just as pictured, my daughter likes them & they fit her mouth better than other brands we have tried. A great pacifier for a toddler.
These are of really good quality, small and let air around the mouth.  I am happy to recommend this product and would definitely purchase again.
these are awesome!  i used the blue & green ones with my son & just ordered the pink & purple set for my daughter that is due in a few months :)
use these in my 2500sqft two story house and they work perfectly. would recommend to anyone who needs nice good quality, for a reasonable price.
A perfect size for little hands to hold and carry around. My son loves to hold and throw them, and since they are light, he can't do any damage.
My baby girl LOVES all her Wubanubs. After I tried 6 different types of pacifiers, the hospital one was her favorite one. This is a genius idea!
My baby loves his paci and the animal attached makes it so easy for him to find it!  We will definitely buy another one for our next child(ren).
A lot of parents purchased the item.<br />The baby loves it.<br />easy to find<br />The baby easily can take it out and put it back in her mouth
I have reordered these probably 5 times. My LO loves them. They were the only ones that didn't leave a dent around his lips from where he sucked.
This was a gift for my cousin's shower, but if I have a girl, I'll purchase it again! Very cute! Product was exactly how it looks in the picture.
The same quality of all other Avent's products. The only &#34;problem&#34; is the bottle nipple number 2, because my baby is already in number 4.
Love this! It's big enough to fit 2 of the Avent soothie pacifiers.<br />The plastic is very durable, and the clasp is strong so it stays closed.
I bought these for my son cause hes a pacifier baby and only because they dont sell yellow in Hawaii they only sell green, blue, pink and purple.
This pacifier is soo cute. My son really likes it. It is easy to use, the animal is soft and goes with us everywhere! One of his favorite things!
this is such a cute and sweet toy.  i bought it for my grandbaby and she just loves it.  so colorful and soft.  i am very happy with my purchase.
Easy to find in the middle of the night because they glow in the dark which is a fantastic feature!!! Love this product and will continue to use!
my wife and i tried a thousand bottle brushes . this is by far the best. buy the one with the stand. keeps germs away and your counter clean too.
baby loves this! it's very soft. luckily, i received a boy color! i recommend this item for gift giving. i plan to order more for new baby gifts.
My son couldnt hold a pacy in his mouth by his self since he is a preemie. This has helped him get the soothing he needs and he loves to hold it.
These are my baby's favorite pacifiers. They are good quality, good price, are super cute and come in a nice little case great for my diaper bag.
good price. had to buy as our daughters puppy keep getting ahold of these and ate them. guess he thought was his. lol  Good quality for the money
Use them constantly and the baby loves them. Don't go for the less expensive pacifiers! These are worth the price and I'm glad we purchased them.
My son loves his Wubbanub, I have two now and will order another one. They are great in the case they wake up at night and have to search for it.
this product better that others. the quality is good and it works as described. highly recommend for those people who breast feed their newborns.
My baby cant use it yet since her mouth is so small, but I have had one before with my son when he was a baby... Can't wait to see her with it...
my grandson couldn't stop using his music box and he's a great dancer.  he's a sesame street characters lover and elmo happens to be his favorite
exactly as pictured. secures well to crib. colors are perfect for any baby girl's room. so glad i finally found a mobile that works as described!
My daughter loves these! You can prop it against something so it stays in her mouth better, and she loves holding onto the stuffed animal part :)
Perfect for my grandson.  The nice thing about these is that they are easy for a little one to grab and find, especially when they wake at night.
Great! Fast delivery and my baby loved it! The Best one I've tried. The sad part are the brazilian taxes. They are more expensive than pacifiers.
I ordered this for my baby before he was born...turns out he won't take a pacifier.  But this is really cute!!!!  Love it, wish he would take it.
Keeps pacidiers handy. Fits 2 soothie pacidiers. I've had this for several months now and the Velcro is still strong (unlike some other reviews).
LOL this is hilarious. It's so &#34;gansta&#34;. I got this for my friend's baby shower. She had the mustache one. She couldn't stop cracking up.
i love it,  my son does too<br />makes it easy for him to put back in his mouth (3m). easy to find anywhere,  great as gifts,  will deff buy more
My baby who is ebf doesn't usually like pacifiers but he really likes this one. Unfortunately so does our dog who ate the other one in this set..
Same as the Pacifier that you get at the hospital in the nursery just  in a pretty color so the baby doesn't know the difference and adjust well.
Love the new WubbaNub. My 8 month old daughter loves the elephant since there are many places for her to grab and easily put back into her mouth.
Works great. Easy to wedge in place near our baby so he can suck on it but soft and squishy enough it's not something he chokes on when he barfs.
great sippy that doesn't leak.  most sippy cups leak, this one doesn't.  i like nuk and the lids are interchangeable.  plus, it's a training cup.
love it for kids bathtub toys.  out of the way and keeps everthing tidy.  delivery was quick and the quality is good for being a plastic product.
This is the same brand pacifier that was given to my daughter at the hospital so when we lost it we just got some more and my daughter loves them
this blanket is as soft and cute as it looks!  my little boy drags it around everywhere it goes, and it still looks brand new after a few washes.
My grandson loves his WubbaNub Brown Puppy. I got him a blue one too. He is just beginning to hold things and likes to grip on the stuffed puppy.
Since both liked this pacifier has also bought more than three months. Recommend. The shape and material are excellent. Congratulations to Avent!
this is my favorite gift for baby showers. these cards are beautiful, and newborns love to look at them! they also make great nursery decorations.
Bought this when my son was only a few months old.  It made sleeping time such a breeze.  He still has it now and has become his Security blanket.
These are our favorite type of paci - just great quality and we like the &#34;Air&#34; design which doesn't smother that sweet delicate face skin.
this product works great for keeping children's hands and puppy paws from tearing screens! it is very flimsy but sturdy when secured it works well
We callit Steak and he loves it :) We never lose it and he's easy to find in the dark or the car. My son also loves having something to hold onto.
These glow in the dark for many hours! Makes finding them when my son spits them out in the middle of the night very easy. Definitely recommend!!!
i think i need a guide to know how to use it as expected.<br /><br />the instruction just told me how to use, rather than how to use, you know it.
my 2-yr old grandson sleeps on it when he is at our house.  i double a small throw for a pad and use a towel to cover him up.  it works perfectly.
I love these. I just wish they came in colors so we could find them easier. The binky monster strikes again! I know he is hoarding them somewhere.
These are great and can be used upside down as well (which I was concerned about when I ordered) though we try not to sport our Cards upside down!
My baby doesn't like pacifiers, my dog hates all dog toys. My baby LOVES these. My dog ate one and loved it. So yeah, totally worth the 5 stars :)
the cutest thing ever!  our grandbaby loves it.  she spins the flowers on the mirrors.  the stirring wheel plays several different songs.  love it
Ordered for a friend who just had a new baby. My daughter LOVED hers when she was first born. Plus it helps keeps the pacifier in and/or close by.
love that I could find a bundle on for the price I have an autistic 3 1/2 yr old daughter who hates chewy tubes and loves to bite these pacifiers.
i received this in a timely manner; and was very pleased with the product. it works perfectly in my grandson's bedroom. very pretty and well made.
My granddaughter loves to hold her wubbanub and so does my daughter...who can find this pacifier one handed in a deep diaper bag. Shipped quickly.
this is such a 'why didn't i think<br />of that?!' product. perfect for schlepping my wiggly 2year old through airports on international flights..
My son LOVES his Mustache and cries when he can't have it! Not to mention it's super cute! Grandparents, it is a must have for your new grandsons.
I am very happy with my monkey wubbanub. It is small enough to be comfortable for an infant.  I think it is so cute, hopefully the baby enjoys it!
Easy to read, pretty sturdy ( had been drooped couple of times ) and pretty handy if you have a baby at home ..  even will work with adults ..  :D
much cheaper alternative to the medela breastpump wipes- perfect size.  Also place throughout the house for quick pacifier clean. Will order again
My 2 year old still uses a binky and loves wubbabnubs! This bull is cute and well made. We have about 5 different wubbanubs and he loves them all!
Our sons loves this! We can't go anywhere without it. It is his comfort piece. He doesn't just use the pacifier, but chews on all of the legs too.
you will find this easy to install on your bike, its well made, solid construction, good directions and replacement parts are available if needed.
I love these it allows us to easily clean off pacifiers and teethers! Smells really good too! They are great because what is not always available.
These are the only pacifiers that our little one will use.  They're great and inexpensive, so it's no big deal if you lose one, which will happen.
love love love!! i was wishing to find this product one day while exclusively pumping! and i just love them! i highly recommend this product line!
love the swaddle me products!  these organic cotton swaddle me's are silky soft and the velcro really sticks well!  highly recommend this product!
I breast feed exclusively and my baby is able to easily switch between this pacifier and my nipple. My newborn is also able to hold this pacifier.
fits my dream on me 3&#34; spring coil portable crib mattress perfectly. loved the design and nice and soft for baby. just what i was looking for.
Best thing ever for infants!  Easy to find and rarely lose.  Plus it's cute.  Like the giraffe the best because it's easiest to find in nighttime.
i love this canvas-style print and the ability to take this with our family when we move instead of leaving the marks behind.  very pretty colors.
Was so very tickled to find a wubbanub tiger to put in my daughter's hope chest.  We are all LSU tiger fans and I just love the little tiger wub!!
i loved it my niece looked so cute=) im gonna end up buying more as soon as i start having my own kids they look funny and its a unique pacifier..
the bedding set was even nicer than on line. my grandson likes trains and  i just happened to see the bedding set on line and he needed a new one.
Received quickly.  Ordered as a gift.  Parents thought it was very cute!  Baby has yet to be delivered to try pacifier.  Gave 5 stars for cuteness!
There are lots of styles of binkies out there, this one is only one our baby likes.  Have a few of these, in your diaper bag, purse and stroller...
i love it! and easy and secure way to carry baby facing front, it carries in other ways too, but i got it specifically for my baby to be facing out
Small enough to hang from anywhere but big enough to hold two (I use the Mam pacifiers) I love that's gender neutral and doesn't take space at all.
we bought one of these before for our 2 year old.  now he's three and he's got a one year old brother so we bought a three pack.  really good idea.
I love this.  Some reviewers need to lighten up.    Our 10 month old doesn't use a pacifier, but we got it in long enough for a few good snapshots.
i bought these for my grandkids because their little hands just can't hold the larger cups without all the spills.  these are perfect for toddlers.
i bought this, already have two others of two different brands.  i am really impressed with out strongly this one grips.  i will buy more of these.
.the package didn't include 8 corners what is advertised. excellent quality and cost effectives, though the seller sent the missing pieces promptly
I knew as soon as my friend announced she was having a baby, that I HAD to get these for her, and delivery of the item was SUPER fast. Thank you!!!
No more lost paci!  It is also more difficult for it to fall out of her mouth.  Now that she is a little older, she loves to rub it and snuggle it.
finally the monitors last through the night, good fit in our graco monitors the lead wires are actually a little longer than the original batteries
my daughter loved having this toy on her highchair to play with while in her seat!  the suction worked great.  the toy is very sturdy and colorful!
this monitor is perfect.  i can see the baby at all times, hear him and talk to him.  i love everything about this monitor and highly recommend it.
imho absolutely best pacifiers out there.  my baby loved these from day 1 and we tried many different brands. i've already bought the next size up.
This is one of my baby's favorite paci.  The hospital gave it to him first and I have bought a variety of paci's and he enjoys this brand the most.
He is super cute. His legs aren't quite as heavy as some of the wubbanubs to keep him in place, but the shape of his legs kind of make up for that.
This is the 4th one I have bought. This one was for a boy baby shower. They are so nice and babies just love them. I highly suggest for a new baby.
Our son has had one of these since 6 months, and now at 12 months is more attached to it than ever.  we now own 3!  They're adorable and practical.
Love it! Much easier for me to keep up with and he can hold it while he uses pacifier. I have two, so I can wash one and he still can play with one
these are totally adorable!  and great for keeping baby's ankles warm as well as for easy diaper changing.  and i like that they are boy designs :)
Our 2 month old loves her wubbanubs! I would highly recommend for any baby who uses a soothie pacifier. Easy to wash- right in the washing machine!
It's sooo cute and my daughter loves it! It's super soft and she likes to hold on to it. I would recommend this product for anybody who has a baby!
i purchase this for my niece & their parents like it very much while her father is driving she was in save as she sleeps<br />& she use it as a toy
I am a very clean person and with my husband and I's first child I wanted to make sure that the baby's pacifier stayed clean. This is a great idea!
These are the only pacifiers my daughter will take and she loves the glittery ones! great pacifiers but would love it if they came in bigger packs!
This is the same pacifier my son used in the hospital and has used ever since. I love them and they're easy to sanitize. A must have for all babies
my daughter really likes these now that she is 5 months old. (at 4 months she didn't as much.) she finds the ends easily and appears to enjoy them.
we bought this for my 4 month old for christmas. she likes to get her hands under the bands. it's bigger than it looks. this sensory ball is great!
Perfect for my little one, just like the ones she got at the hospital.  Only downside is not having a ring to hang on to, but not much of an issue.
just what i imagined it would be. wife thought the tote would be larger, but she failed to look at the dimensions in the description, so go figure.
I bought this for my 4mo old grandson. He looks even more adorable when he's sucking; I just cant keep my eyes off of him. Sizing was also perfect.
Adorable and hilarious.  Got it as a gift and the newly proud parents love it.  I thought it would be a good gag gift but they use it all the time.
The sound it makes resemble more a truck passing by than in uterus sound BUT the battery lasts for ever and my little man seems to enjoy it anyway!
Have not tried very many pacifiers but my baby seems to really like this one. The covers that come with each pacifier is very nice. Colors are nice.
pillow is amazing, my wife sleeps like a charm with this i would recommend it to every pregnant woman out there for a very comfortable rest and more
My sob loves his wubbanub so much that he has 3 I would highly recommend any of the different wubbanub creatures as my son has a dinosaur a girraffe
has a good locking system to keep baby out of my cupboards. looks like shoe laces only nicer esp since i had tied all sorts of weird looking things.
baby took a little while to get used to it cause she had a standard regular one for a while. but when she got used to it, there was no turning back.
cute design, functional, serves its purpose. my husband did have to zip tie it to the faucet so it wouldn't fall off, but other than that no issues.
we tried several different door locks to keep our 2year old inside.  this was the only one that she couldn't figure out!  you won't be disappointed!
My baby boy loves his Lambie. So much so that I am purchasing a second one.<br />The lamb is soft and cute and is still going strong after 5 months.
i started w newborn guava mitts.  they were big the first two months.  but after the 3rd month, it fit so nicely.  i purchased more in a large size.
works well for my daughter.  easy to clean and helps reduce tummy issues.  she loves the bottle, but it does not take away from her desire to nurse.
Great, I just loved the baby MUTE BUTTON pacifier! It arrived in a timley manner in great condition and looked even better than described in the ad.
The only person who's opinion matters would probably give this 3 stars because it is not the duck WubbaNub, but your little one may think otherwise.
She pets his ears and pulls his face to hers when she is sleepy. She can easily find it at night and his ears helps her know which end to insert. ;)
These cardinal paci's help make my nephew a cardinal fan from head to toe. Along with his Cardinal outfit , bucket hat and blanket he is a true fan.
Bought this for my son when he was born. The animal was a little small so it didnt quite keep the pacifier in place, but for the price it was great!
These weren't for me. It was a present for someone expecting a newborn. But she seemed pleased with them: cute and conveniently stored and BPA-free!
love this hippo! water flows out perfectly from harry's mouth. he keeps a soft cushion on the faucet in case a head gets too close during bath time.
I purchased this for a co-worker who has a son due to be born this summer. An inexpensive gift idea that's BPA free and officially licensed by NCAA.
Mustaches were meant for babies.  Super adorable, about large...but kids will fit them eventually.  I would recommend buying for family and friends.
the pacifier box really worst money,it can fill 2 pacifier, the handle u can put on the stroller, car seat or on diaper bags. it make pacifier clean
Gave as a gift - the family loved it - -appears to be well made - no comment on quality / usefulness as they haven't yet used it - 6 month pacifier.
Love this product. We especially love using this while our baby is in the car seat because the weight of stuffed animal keeps the pacifier in place.
this product is great leaves ur hands free and makes breastfeeding in public easy! easy to use and a great price. i would recommend this to any one.
The thermometer comes in handy when you have a fussy baby who refuses to stay still and need to know if they have a fever. Medicine dropper same way
i am so glad i found the baby dipper feeding set!  it has made it fun and easy to feed my son.  i wish i would have had this sooner!  great product!
this is the cutest and much loved item my great-grandson has.  he loves it and it soothes him which i believe is most important for a teething baby.
this us the most affordable thing i have ever seen! it is everything the description says and more. it arrived as promised and was packed very well.
I did not want to use pacifiers however the NICU gave these to my daughter. She loves them and this is the only pacifier type she will not spit out.
these are so great! you can see the face of your rear facing infant and make sure they are ok with just one glance. i would definitely buy it again.
Good service, cute product. It was fun to see a baby with this and take pictures. Some of the younger kids wanted to try it and hummm...some adults.
My son loves these! This is the same one that comes on the wubbanub and my son likes the soothies. I buy them for every friend I know having a baby!
We bought a lot of different kinds, but my son loves this kind. At first time I bought it just for fun. Very good quality. Made in Germany. Love it!
Oh my lord this little guy is ubber adorable and TINY! My second baby is not here yet, but the item appears well made and is very soft and adorable.
work very well and has lots of space for different bottles. was purchased for a baby shower and a \\must have\\ was cheaper here than in the stores.
this blanket is very soft, warm and beautiful! its a great accessory for any beautiful baby :) i got this as a gift to my niece and her mom loves it
we got one for one grandson and liked it so well, we ordered one for another grandson!  good size, colorful and good quality!  arrived very quickly.
It works great our daughter uses it all the time. It was recommended by a friend of ours so we tried it and its a good thing we did its pretty cool.
These are great, just like her others but have the Hello Kitty on the front.  Cute and fun.  Gets washed all the time and the image hasn't worn off.
Just exactly how I imagined it would be. Great prouct; even fits a couple bulky Soothie pacifiers and easy to access as well as attach to diaper bag!
My son only likes MAM. We've tried other brands but this is the one he always asks for. Carry case/sanitizer case is great and convenient for travel.
My youngest daughter's favorite toy, lovey, paci, etc.  Adorable, washable, durable, functional. Is easy to clean and holds up well to wear and tear.
These are absolutely adorable and useful. They are bigger so they keep the pacifier in babies mouth and also are good for baby to hold. I love these.
i had to buy a second one of these.  moo moo has been my daughter's favorite cuddler since she was 6 months old.  she can't seem to sleep without it.
We have used these for all 3 of our children! We love the giraffe.  Very prompt delivery after a not so good transaction with another seller. Thanks!
my little girl kept biting holes in her sippy cup nipples.  these fit perfectly and even worked on other sippy cup brands.  i know where to get more!
she's cool, really twirls to my expectations, arrived on time.  i didn't know they are inter changeable so i want to collect more and change them up.
Same as what he was given in the hospital. Thicker rubber then most pacifiers. So by the time he start teething, he's not going to bite through them.
Haven't found one that hasn't been enjoyed.  When I put together a diaper cake or gift basket I want one of these included.  They are fun and useful.
My baby loves this pacifier. The giraffe makes it easy for her to hold on to it and keeps it from falling out of her mouth. It also doubles as a toy.
These are soooo cute and great deal! Everywhere else we've seen them they're at least 4-5 dollars! We got these as add ons for a little more than $2!
Our four month loves his Wubanub's. They give him the independence to control when he wants his pacifier. Easy to locate because of the attached toy.
Bought one of these to go along with my sons vampire costume and everyone loved it. Decent buy that put the finishing touches on my sons costume. >=)
My sister in law says that this will definitely help when the baby is born if he takes it. She is so excite and so nervous for this is her first one.
Mam pacifiers are the only ones our baby will take and the glow in the dark makes it much easier to find when he drops it in the middle of the night!
good product. works perfect. syncs great with exisiting set. would recommend the summer infant baby touch camara for moms who need visual reasurance.
these travel caps are great. we had thrown out the originals for some reason when we first got the bottle set so its nice they sell replacement ones.
The same pacifier that is given to you in hospitals. We lost our free one and had to buy replacements. My son never used any other kind but this one!
These are our fav. We used the smaller sizes as well. The stars lured me in, the glowing handle is neat but not super useful, but we still love them.
This is the only pacifier we could get the baby to take other than the soothie, which covers the babies whole face. Very thankful for an alternative.
Never a problem with MAM! I especially love how open these are. Help keep the area around the mouth from breaking out as bad with all those slobbers!
My baby loves these! It's nice because the binkie stays in their mouth when they are little, and gives them something to grab onto as they get older.
our friends were delighted..it met their needs in style<br />we would suggest this to anyone. all inclusive<br />easy to use and comfy for the babies
This is the only type of pacifier our baby will take so far. The hospital only gave us one and I was afraid we'd lose it so we ordered this 2 pack :)
Favorite binky by far.  In fact our first one(which our dogs loved also...) was so great that we ordered a second after it was defluffed by the dogs.
we bought two of these seats (one for the lexus the other for the bmw) and love them.  the colors blend nicely and the baby is happy.  no complaints.
cute then, cute now. my toddlers love their skip hop zoo lunch bags! held up well for over a year and still going strong! would definitely recommend!
My daughter loves these pacifiers.  The size is perfect for her 4 month old mouth.  The design ensures her nose is not blocked by the plastic shield.
Love these glow in the dark pacis!! They don't stay super bright all night but they are lit up just enough that you can find it in a pitch black room
From what I've heard, little guy is enjoying it very much.  Gives him something to hold onto a little better, and it sure was nice as a baptism gift.
I bought this &#34;stachifier&#34; as a surprise for a friend's little boy ...best and most adorable present ever!!! Definitely would buy this again!
this is an amazing mat, it has soo much of activites for baby. the batteries have to change, my music did not work as yet. would def. recommend this.
you never have enough hooded towels for baby either after bath or later on the beach.  gerber has always made a quality product at a reasonable price.
had a lot of trouble with company that handled the product.  two months to settle the problem. a person from amazon helped me with solving the problem
these scissors are great for little hands and nails. i was so terrified to cut my son's nails after he was born, but these made it easy and pain-free.
It's soft and flexible. She used it at the hospital and doesn't like any kind of pacifier but this one. Glad I was able to find it. Not sold in stores
my son loves sassy rings and at a great price u can't lose!! i had gotten bright starts rings and they were made cheaply and my son showed no interest
Is the only type of pacifier that my daughter wants. She refused all the silicone pacifiers and this it was our last chance. Fortunately, it worked!!!
was using summer infant pad but our son's head was small so bubbling everywhere especially while sleeping. these elephant ears lock his head in place.
Love these. They are exactly the same as the ones in the hospital. I have bought 4 packs already and only because I'm clumsy and keep losing them lol.
My 7 week old loves these more than Any other brand. Not bulky and light, he can actually hang on to these as opposed to the all rubber/silicone ones.
This was the only pacifier my son could hold in his mouth while he was a newborn.  It really saved my life that the pacifier held itself in his mouth.
Avent really is a great Brand! Love the styles, everything I wanted! Great buy! The only thing I don't like is that you don't get to choose the styles
i have these near the floor so my daughter can play with them, she likes them and they have stayed on the wall very well. they look great in her room.
This is such a cute pacifier. Used to have a duck but lost it so I ordered this and my little man loves it to. He loves holding onto the elephant leg.
Best pacifiers available :) Only thing to be aware of is that this is an infant pacifier, meaning they are easily chewed up once your child has teeth.
My 5 month old daughter has had these since 3 weeks old & loves them!! We're tried to introduce other pacifiers & she did not want them. Only these!!!
this blanket is so soft. it is great for my newborn son, and he won't outgrow the pattern. this company has such high quality items that are also fun.
my daughter is a little wwe diva in training. she is absolutly brutal when it comes to her toys and this thing really stands up to the abuse. love it!
this playpen works well. it is not that high, but little dogs can't jump over it.  i had to buy the extension to make it larger for more than one dog.
My daughter loves these. I'm glad I bought in bulk because they tend to end up behind the crib - so it reduces the number of escavations I have to do.
good for holding diaper prefolds in the correct shape and freeing hands to handle the diaper covers. saved a lot of time, especially with wiggly kids.
As Anyone would know These are Essential for a Newborn or infant. These were made with a Good design,  Baby Proven!! I would recommend this product...
great bib for any police officer to be. i wish they had more police officer related items like this. my son loves it and husband got a kick out of it.
I bought this for my newborn granddaughter last year.  It helped to sooth her to sleep so well that I ordered another one last month as a shower gift.
Love this pacifier. It doesn't get lost as easily as other pacifiers. My grandson can find it & hold onto it a lot more easily than regular pacifiers.
My son loved wubbas but I like this one in particular because it's light and the ease of stuffing it into a jean pocket!  Not all wubbas are equal....
Got this for my nephew for his first birthday.  All the adults in the room couldn't stop laughing when he used this, and he seemed to like it as well!
My nephew wasn't liking any of the pacifiers they tried, I got these for him and he loves them! Now that he's 7 months he still uses them as teethers.
Love this little caterpillar.  I bought this for my niece, and she loves it.  Such a sweet little toy for her to play with while sucking her pacifier.
i gave this to my tow grandsons (one is 2 and the other just turned 1) for christmas and they loved. an old fashon simple toy that needs no batteries.
item was received as a gift for our newborn grand babies.  we are excited to be able to hold both babies with confidence that they are happy and safe.
after several blowouts with my one month old, i purchased this for my britax b safe carseat. it fits perfectly fine and saves tons of time on accidents
My son will only use MAM binkeys and these ones glow in the dark so its easier to find it in the crib. Only wished the glow would last a little longer.
These are our favorite pacifiers hands down. As an added bonus, the football design is perfect for our little guy at Texas high school football games!!
He would not go to sleep without his Wubby! He always held on to the little animal like he was hugging it. Both my sons did this when they were little.
giraffe's long neck allows my baby to grab it easily. unfortunately, my baby is a hand/finger sucker rather than a paci sucker. product is good though.
I love these little guys! So cute, so easy to find, and pretty cheap. Just make sure your kid loves the soothie and your dog doesnt find it before you.
Purchased these for our daughter that is to be born in a few weeks. Our son loved all time tippee products and we are hoping the same for our daughter.
granddaughter loves it. sleeps well on it and fits perfectly in the pack and play. recommend this to all looking for a mattress for their pack and play
God-son loves this :)  Wish they were available at more local stores too :)  Pricey though.shew!!  Don't like that you can't exchange pasies with it...
the original battery on the avent baby monitor dropped to under 4 hours after 18 months of daily use.  this battery starts with over 30 hours lifetime.
this very durable and comfortable. my kid love it. weve been using is for awhile and never have problems, easy to detached if i need to wash the cover.
These are a must for parents! Our baby takes well to them and this color is easy to spot on the floor when they're dropped, especially in low lighting!
great cover and really cute. we've been using it for 3 months. the diaper has held up nicely, and i love how it grew with my son. it's so customizable.
Good quality product and very very cute and snuggly. Could also cute the giraffe off the nuk when you are phasing them out which may stop some tantrums
bought this chair for my 20 year old cat and she just loves it.  easy for her to get in and out of.  i choose the brown gingham and it is quite lovely.
love this color! runparooz and thirsties are my fave covers and they do not fail! i love that the newborn is adjustable and fits up to 15 lbs i think m
Never disappointed!  I remembered having a pacifier pod 8 years ago that I loved, so I knew just what to order with this baby!! Best quality out there.
This is too cute. Got it in mail quickly. Holds the pacifier in my grandsons mouth and he holds on to elephant. Will be a big hit come football season!
just the right size and match!  nice deep slots perfect for storage and bins in front.  will make a great shelf after changing pad is no longer needed.
works great. after use i just rinse off in warm soapy water , let dry and use later. it's great because i don't need to put them in the washing machine
These are the only pacifiers that my 3 week old likes. They absolutely save the day when my daughter is being fussy. I absolutely love these pacifiers!
My wife like them more than the baby himself. But he really likes them too, because he spends hours sucking them, unless he's hungry and spit them out.
This product is quality we really liked me and my wife this will look good on my unborn child this, I hope to continue buying in the future with amazon
this is an excellent kit to use with the pump.  the cooler bag fits perfectly in the pump bag and the bottles are just the right size.  great purchase!
This is the only passy my 6 wk old will take.  I think it resembles a real nipple the most and promotes her to suck in the same way she would latch on.
Everything about this transaction was great.  I bought this as a gift for a co-worker's baby shower.  She loves vampire shows and obviously loved this.
My son does not like a binki all the time but this one he does love.  He likes to look at the bear and hold it.  The teething ring is a great addition.
My baby kept getting a rash where the pacifier sheild was against her face so we started giving her these at night. They fixed the problem within days.
my baby refused to sleep on hard surfaces like the pnp mattress. this sheet gave it a nice plush softness and cushion so that she'd finally take a nap.
we were very happy with this little coverlet. it is just the color and design we were searching for. it seems to be well made and we like it very much.
I love that these pacifiers are made in one piece, with no nooks or crannies for dirt, fluids, or food particles to get stuck in.  Washing is a breeze.
lived up to fisher price reputation.  very colorful and attracts baby's attention.  mat is great for rug surface.  would not recommend on hard surface.
It's a really cute bobo (pacifier) makes my lil' cutie fat man have a lil' extra personality, love it! Would suggest this and any other one to anybody!
Pacis are exactly as described! Cannot go wrong with these! The same ones they give you in the hospital except pink and purple! So adorable for a girl!
They are adorable. My daughter loves them. I like the quality of the Wubbanubs. They are great for little hands to hold into their pacifier in the car.
These are the only ones my 8 month old will take. By these I mean this brand. They last!  I recommend the night ones for use in the dark....very clever!
this product is a must for babies.  very safe... i found a amazing deal on amazon.  research the vulli sophie the giraffe teether if you havent already.
I couldn't make it a night without these! Since they are glow in the dark I never need a light to see where my daughter has dropped them. Easy to clean!
very good.  i bought it for my 7 months old babies and it keep them inside.  improvement - need to improve on suction so it will stay up and more sturdy
Wubbanubs are a real hit with my 6 month old.  She loves sleeping with it at night.  A pain to clean, but totally worth it :)  Have a few in rotation...
i purchased this gate for my boston terrier.  it works great because there is nothing for him to put his back legs on to climb out like the other gates.
i have used this pump during a couple of years for some short trips i have made without my baby, and the pump is still working properly ! great product!
I wish I had thought of this!  My infant granddaughter loves it, with the little stuffed animal she can easily grip the binky herself.  Really adorable!
My little guy LOVES this pacifier.  He's just learning to suck and gets frustrated when his paci falls out and this helps him keep it in! Great product!
Recommended by the hospital! High quality pacifiers! Even the pediatrician recommended this brand! Buy with confidence! I highly recommend this product!
My daughter is really enjoying these pacifiers.  They stay in her mouth better than others we've tried and they do not leave impressions like others do.
very nice material for baby to scoot, crawl, and learn to walk. it is hard enough to allow for crawling but soft enough to protect a baby if they falls.
I love this product and would recommend this to everyone.  The price is so much less and comes in fast.  Our family loves this product and use it often!
There is nothing wrong with this product, but our baby preferred another brand. They were even shaped the same, so I'm not sure why it made a difference
Thankfully we got the color we wanted. :) my son loves these pacifiers since they are symmetrical. Not sold in a lot of stores so glad to find them here
These are great for my daughter, as she likes to read a bit before going to bed. They are bright enough that she can read for a while, then go to sleep.
i bought this and several others of this brand to make a cloth diaper cake for my sister-in-law. they were a great quality and worked out really nicely!
this product is high quality, i was afraid it would be of a cheap material.  i highly recommend it, it was delivered faster than the estimated delivery.
Got as a gift for a mom to be and she loved it. Came in retail packaging and looks like the real deal. Not sure why other reviews said it was knock off?
I think our 2 month old is starting to hug this cute guy when she is soothing herself.  It also makes for some sweet pictures with two sets of big eyes.
These are the exact same Pacifiers that come from the NIC-U (Hospital). Our little one got used to this one and only this one. therefore we needed more.
Perfect! My son loves his wubbanubs. We have bought the cow and dinosaur too. They last and are easy to clean. Will definitely be ordering another soon!
absolutely the best purchase we made, i love this stroller, as does my daughter.  i highly recommend the bob stroller,  it is great for our daily walks.
I love these pacifiers, they are wonderful and everyone recommends them. I love this product and will continue to purchase them for future baby showers.
This Rubber Pacifier works really good, and our baby loves it very much. I've tried no less than five pacifier, and this is the only we are still using.
My baby is really happy with these. I think it has to do with the fact that the nipple is flat not rounded. I like the clear look - really slick design.
My little one adores this paci. She had the teddy bear and loved it so I purchased this one to add to her collection. Cute, good quality, easy to clean.
This is a cute one... I got it for my sis-in law I hope she and her husband likes it and most important her baby (who is not even born yet) likes it :-d
used for a 12 hr each way trip with a 20 lb 12 month old.  worked great and she slept well in it.  have  it in a van pilot-type seat and it fits easily.
his nanny bought him his first and he used it so much that i had to find the exact some one to replace it. i bought two. great product. would recommend.
the projection is amazing... my wife and i find ourselves staring at the projection more than our daughter! it's fun and practical with classic tunes...
There's not much more to say.  Give your baby or your friend's or your friend's friend's baby a cool 'stache.<br /><br />(Annoying minimum word review.)
i use these decals to help keep the birds from crashing into my windows. they have been very helpful. the number of fatalities is significantly reduced.
these work great for my 8 month old son. he loves the different feel of each block. some are noisy, some have mirrors, etc. great entertainment for him.
Great product for keeping a paci in an infant's mouth!  I wish I had known about it sooner.  Monkey is cute, too.  I can see my son learning to love it.
i sleep better knowing my baby is sleeping safely in her halo sleep sack! we have been using these for about 3 months and i would highly recommend them.
can not wait to have my little man here , everyone told me that these are amazing so i went ahead and got a set. they arrived before i thought they would
My daughter loves these! The stuffed animal makes it easier to find it and my little one loves holding on to it when she's got the pacifier in her mouth.
great-grandaughter already has a horse like this. it is her favorite. we almost lost &#34;horsie&#34;. now we have a friend in case that tragedy happens.
i love the minky for the price it is worth it no leaks no rashes ( super diligent on changing diapers often) does the job well without being ultra pricey
great for attaching toys, snack cups, and sip pies to highchairs, jumperoos, and strollers.  use your imagination, i have several of these and love them.
i love the waterproof pads that velcro off and on.  i don't have to fiddle with fitted sheets to change my baby's crib.  the piddle pads make it so easy!
we use it when we are changing his diaper and at night when he is in his swing.<br />he loves the music and looking at the images on the wall and ceiling
These paci's are great because they are slightly weighted with bean bag limbs. It helps keep the paci in place and the characters make them more visible.
These are my daughter's favorite pacifiers. They're a life saver at nap and bedtime when she just wants to fuss. Easy to clean and no hard plastic parts.
My granddaughter started using a WubbaNub at birth and is still using it at 5 months.  All the designs are really cute - I haven't seen one I don't like.
my little ones favorite book! some of the word associations are abstract, but he live it because it has mickey mouse. it is helping him recognize letters
I really like these pacifiers! I always wondered how she'd breath when she had a stuffy nose, so I had to give these a try! They work great and are cute!
these burp cloths are soft, cute and they deal with the drool with no problems.  i received my first set as a gift and loved them so much, i bought more!
i have previously had a similar rocker and glad i bought it again..item was received on april 12, which was quicker than anticipated, which is fantastic.
I just couldn't see a teddy bear making my little one fall asleep, but it works!!! I suggest you swaddle your child first then place the teddy bear down.
Our daughter loved this binky! I was upset when out new puppy chewed it up!!!! Would buy again if we wasn't trying to break our daughter on the binky now
We received a TT pacifier in a bottle set that someone bought us. We tried the pacifier  and baby enjoyed it enough that we invested in more for daycare!
Great and BPA free.  Also nice that they come in different patterns so it's easy to tell which one has been out longer and needs to go in the dishwasher.
We had one of these before and it lasted a long long time... until a big man stepped on it... so I love this pack of the m! The lil ones will love these!
I love that the nose is cutout for infants!!  Soooo smart!!! We always thought the ones from the hospital looked like they were blocking an infants nose!
gave as a baby shower gift.  they loved it!  i loved it - it's beautiful.  i stuffed it with a clothesline gift of baby clothes, books, bibs.  a big hit!
These little wipes are fabulous. Not a strong smell and so convenient for when a binki  gets dropped. Clean well. Buy a few packages, you will need them.
These are exactly like the pacifiers given at the hospital. I had a hard time finding some just like it, and they are the only type my daughter will use.
Super cute and baby loves it. It's so cute when she holds into the dragon. This is actually the second one that we bought; needed a backup (just incase).
My daughter loves these!  I cannot have enough.  I don't leave home without them....... The quality of the stuffed animal is beautifully made & adorable.
Only ones my daughter wants.  I have tried others but these are the ones that soothe her.  For me I would highly recommend them.<br />They worked for me!
cute pattern, but this is not 100 percent cotton, as advertised. it鈥檚 not that big a deal, so we use it, but i really was looking for 100 percent cotton.
Bought for my future niece/nephew, dad-to-de thinks its awesome. It may be more of a novelty paci, vs. an everyday go to, but it is right up their alley.
My son was born with PRS and these are the only pacis that work for him and his high palete.  He can hold it in his mouth and create suction.  Love them!
These are by far my favorite binkies. My little guy is nursing and used these right from the start with no problems or confusion. Seriously a life saver!
if your baby likes smoothie pacifiers then this is perfect! no more lost binkies! my son loves it and it's super cute, i ordered another one the next day!
excellent product ...looks nicer when you recieve it than online! our granddaughter loves it!!<br />it is made of ceramic material and is easy to turn on.
so handy.  i bought two for a shower gift and the new mom uses them all the time.  you always know where the binky is and it stays clean.  very good idea.
This little thing is cute and holds pacifiers well.  My son doesn't use them very often but it is nice to have them nearby and clean when we do need them!
If you have an issue with your baby trying to put it in their mouth and are afraid they will choke, this cannot fit in any way that they might be able to!
[[videoid:e718ad4e25e6a2a86536d7bffbfbf6ab]] bought this as a gift for my friend who is 23 weeks pregnant. this video shows her using it and her feedback.
My little one loved this pacifier, it is like a Soothie (which she loves) but does not hit her in the nose and you can easily put a pacifier holder on it.
our son has been using it for a while now and there is still 30 lbs left - car seat is up to 60 lbs. we just love it, no problems at all! and, is stylish.
I bought these in bulk so we weren't constantly looking for the pacifier. I put 2 or 3 in daughter's crib so she can look for it at night and self soothe.
I bought one of these for my nursing nephew not knowing if he will be taking a pacifier.  HE LOVES IT!  They are all so cute.  It's hard to pick just one.
I gave these a five star because they are good quality and I wanted them to work, but my son wouldn't have it. He is ebf and only takes the MAM pacifiers.
I bought this for my newborn son. We have yet to use it, as it is for 3 months+. But it is very cute and well made. Would recommend this product to others
so soft and well made. it looks just like the picture and it's actually bigger then the one he had before. i will definitely be buying one for his sister!
so so soft. the baby loves it. he is 5 mo old and it is one of his favorite things . he holds it next to his cheek and dozes off.<br />definately 5 stars.
This is the only pacifier my baby will take. I like the different sizes for the different ages. Says it's ok for the teeth, i guess I'll see in 5 years :)
we strapped these to our car seat and love them. the rattle noise is a soothing sound, not hard and plastic sounding. the colors captivate our little one.
My daughter is in love with the wub a nub. If your child uses soothie pacifiers these are a must. I like them because they are hard to lose with the size.
Love these things :)  I don't know what I would do without them.  My daughter loves them also.  They are easy for her to put in her mouth if she drops it.
I purchased several different pacifiers and this type was my daughters favorite and she kept in her mouth much better than other brands that look similar.
Totally grand! My grandson is so very happy with his new &#34;Ellie&#34; and so am I. As always, Amazon is my go-to marketplace for all my shopping needs.
I think these are the best ones I've found so far. The best part is I don't have to worry about soap or water getting stuck in them like the other brands.
bought this as a baby shower gift. my niece now has twin boys and loves the monitor. it works great. the clarity is very good. highly recommend this item.
We love these Philips Avent Binky's. They are hard to find and are great to have around. We keep them all over the house as my daughter loves her Binky's.
We lose pacis all over the house so it's nice to have something a little bigger.  It's also easy for a small child to hold onto when sleeping.  Love this!
My new nephew received this for Christmas. He was born in November and my sister said he's sleeping through the night since she started using it with him!
My baby LOVES these binkies. She refused binkies as an infant until we discovered these. The price on this 2 pack is lower than anywhere else I have seen.
this was a adorable night light.  very sturdy. we purchased this night light for our great nephew who spends the night with us quit often and he loved it.
We love this little tiger...our newborn does, too! He can grab it and hold it so much easier than other pacifiers! Great shipping and service.  Thank you!
My son loves to teeth with this Wub and also likes to snuggle and play with the stuffed animal part.  A great, great buy and we have three different Wubs!
bought these for my grandaughter and fits perfect. this is a wonderful quality product.<br />fast shipper<br />  great soft cotton we love hello kitty!!!!
great sheets for the price!  they fit the dream on me 3&#34; portable crib mattress perfectly.  i'll be purchasing a few more as the quality is very good.
wow thanks to everyone who recommended this as a transition off the bottle. it has worked perfectly for us after trying so hard to get our son off bottles
This is my grandson' s favorite pacifier!  Having the stuffed animal attached makes it easy for him to hold on to it.  They also make a great baby gift!!!
It's best to buy in bulk! I saved money and had backups for when pacifiers got thrown out of the stroller! It's the only kind my granddaughter would take.
delivery was incredibly fast! was a gift but my daughter said it works great. the baby wants the cow, so it doesn't stop the door since she plays with it.
i have choose this rating because i luv quality the timing it was deliver n the stuff butterfly is adorable n my grandaughter luvs it can sleep without it
loved this mat! bathtime is not as hard to manage now. my son loves his bath and likes to stay in for awhile, now that i have this i can enjoy it with him.
awesome product! medela is a great brand for pumps and pumping supplies. used these as backup shields for my pump and no problems or complaints whatsoever.
We love this binky!  Our son loves the rounded tip, no nipple confusion and we dont have to worry about the quality of material he is putting in his mouth.
My daughter loves all her wubbanubs. I bought 4, 'cause she doesn't accept any other pacifier. The blue bear is really cute and babies love vibrant colors.
I've ordered a few of these plush toy pacifiers and the giraffe is definitely my baby's favorite (she likes touching the &#34;horns&#34;). It is very cute.
i ordered this recipe book as  it was a much better value, saved quite a lot.  there are a lot  better of smoothie recipes in there so have a large choice.
Great size for my little 14mo baby, flat little plastic thing to suck on, good size, she popped it in her mouth right away and had no cares in the world :)
These are my daughters &#34;lovey&#34;, such a brilliant invention.  She learned how to put her pacifier in and out at 6 weeks on her own, can't beat that!
I was worried about it coming off, but it is very well attached to the pacifier. This is my second, and will probably buy more! Son loves these at naptime.
my wonderful dhu'l excellent quality and fast delivery, excellent choice<br />there're a lot of choices out there but i stumbled on samsung video monitors.
i really like the way this looks.  easy to put together.  perfect storage solution for the price.  doesn't look cheap and about to fall apart all the time.
This pacifier is so adorable. Brought it for my then ten month old baby. Definitely an attention getter and does it's job as a &#34;mute button.&#34; Haha.
My daughter loves these pacifiers. They are lightweight and I like that they are one piece. There is no hard plastic that can shatter. Just one soft piece.
My twins like them, looks great too, I like the fact that they are light and easily kept clean, you could put them on a table with the nipples pointing up.
Avent is a great brand and there products are always 5 stars.<br />These pair of pacifiers are really good material and excelent choice for newborn babies.
One of my baby's favorite pacifier!! Really cute!! The shape makes it really easy for baby to hold. The material is easy to maintain clean. Love this paci.
Purchased for my Grand daughter to assist with feeding<br />Help with strengthening jaw muscles<br />Good product<br />Have used on my other grand children
it fits a lot of stuff inside; not just dr. brown's products. we go through lots of bottles and pumping equipment and only have to run it twice a day, max.
love how versatile this is to keep toddlers either in or out of a specific room. we use it to keep our toddler out of a room that's not totally childproof.
we absolutely love this crib! can't beat it for the price. my sons crib is nowhere near this nice and we paid more. this is definitely the perfect crib! :)
My daughter loves it, we got this one as a second one because she loved the first one so much (ella bella).  Also bought as shower gifts for all my friends
it's the best blanket ever! is great for the cold nights because covers your baby and it's soft at the same time. my baby loves it. the size is also great.
They gave my son this pacifier in the hospital and I had to get him more of them since he loved them. Especially the vanilla ones. I highly recommend them!
bought as a baby shower gift for some one living in oregon and i live in minnesota , she had a on line shower , it worked , and she was thrilled, good idea
beautiful and functional.  not as strong as some other gates but gets the job done.  i like it bc i can open with one hand and slam shut as i walk through.
this dresser is perfect! it is really built well, very sturdy and definitely has some weight to it. my husband and i love it and we know our baby will too!
Orderd my Serta Baby Sheep from Pack_rats and I love it. I would definately order from them again. excellent service quick turnaround and sheep is adorable
my son loves his pillow; very soft, and perfect size. it's his first pillow, so we're very pleased. great quality; hasn't even stained from toddler drool :
One of the best pacifiers for premiee babies. My daughter loves these and the vanilla scented smoothes her and while she was in the NICU it was a blessing.
These are the cutest pacifiers I've bought my grandson. Even though I wish he would give them up, I would rather he have these that look like a bigger boy.
this hamper is ridiculously cute and practical.  i have it in my son's bedroom.  the design is great...would love to see them get even more animal designs.
My baby is obsessed with this pacifier now that she is a little older, she always took it but now it's like she prefers it. If she likes it then I love it!
light weight and very very convenient. it is &#34;must haves&#34; when you have a bay in a capsule. love the big basket at the bottom. highly recommend it.
For some reason my baby doesn't care for these. They are a great product, soft silicone, flexible, sturdy and well-made.. Your baby may love it, who knows?
My kiddos love their pacifiers and as they grow out of using them I cut the pacifier off the animal and they still have their little lovey to comfort them.
This item was GREAT! it is awesome! GET THIS!! My experience was great! You're baby will love this! I very much enjoyed it because it was soft and squishy!
captain calamari is just too cute!  i love the name of this little guy, and how colorful he is!  perfect for the little grandson's nautical themed nursery!
I love this. I have seen other babies with these and could not wait to get one for my grand princess.  She will be her Nov so we will see how she likes it.
These save our life when he wakes up at 5am -- you can see where the paci is and pop it back in before the freakout. The only brand that our baby will use.
perfect tool for the transition from baby food to table food.  should be used earlier rather than later...once a child has teeth it becomes less necessary.
Really love these. They came in a timely manner and i like how the nipple has the hollowed out portion.  It may make it easier to get rid of her pacifiers.
It helps especially when I drive and baby is in the back. Using the pacifier calm he down during long drive. Baby can latch on properly without falling off
I love these. My son I'm sure will too. They seem to be made very durable for babies. I can't wait for my son to be here in a couple weeks to try them out.
my son calls his pacifiers &#34;ball&#34; because he loves the sports themed nuk pacifiers.  we got all basketball ones sent to us when we ordered, just FYI
love them. they work great and match our crib and crib set. great value for you money. definitely would recommend if you don't want bite marks on your crib.
My granddaughter absolutely loved this I wish they would have had something like this when I had my kid. I would for sure recommend this product for babies.
My baby has used nuk pacifiers since he was born. He loves them and I love its colors and designs. I feel very comfortable and secure with all NUK products.
perfect, simple, gender neutral, pacifier. Although our little guy never really got hooked on the binki we like these, they come wih a nice little cover too
this is a comfy blanket and sheet set and the reversibility allows my 3 year old son to decide which superhero he wants to have each night.  very good item.
So easy for my 10 month old son and I both to find at night. He loves the MAM 6+ shape, though as a younger baby he didn't prefer the MAM newborn pacifiers.
18 months later this is still my daughter's favorite sleep item.  it's cute, it's cuddly.  she likes it so much we got two of them just in case we lose one.
These are amazing.  I have one in every space (kitchen, purse, car, stroller, diaper bag) to keep a clean pacifier- they are so handy.  The hook is perfect!
i bought this for my grandchild.  it is much easier to tighten with the knobs that i found fussing with the strap in the front that is in my daughter's car.
bought this for my 2 year old and he loves it! takes it everywhere. great little monkey & nice size.<br />-just bought a second one for school! great monkey
MAM pacifiers are fantastic. I bought these thinking they glowed in the dark but they do not. However, I ended up keeping them because the colors are great.
I love how conveniently packed it was, and that it came before my little girl's expected arrival!! Thank you! Will definitely be ordering another one soon!!
Love this pillow.  It is perfect and makes sleeping so comfy. I read reviews that said the pillow wouldn't stay together I have not had that problem at all.
item was exactly as described and shipping was prompt. very simple design with solid pieces so nothing can fall off or become dislodged. highly reecomended!
This is the one my daughter picked out for her new baby boy. Its adorable. My granddaughter has a giraffe one and she loves it. I hope my grandson will too.
I cannot stop playing picturing my nephew with pacifier in his mouth. I can't wait until he comes back so that i can snap a gazillion photos of him with it.
She said she show it to her GYN doctor and the dr told her this was the best one on the market right now she loves it now she want the bottles also by Avent
My son's room is decorated in knights, castles and dragons so this was perfect! He never really took a liking to pacifiers but this looks great in his room!
The pacifier shipped right on time and matched my sons costume wonderfully. I was very pleased with this purchase and would definitely recommend this item .
great for the cold. super warm. never had to be one of those parents chasing a tossed out blank or trying to remember it. this is great for the winter time.
I have bought tons of binkies and this is the only one that hasn't disappeared.  I don't know where the other ones end up.  My daughter loves this Wubbanub.
we ordered this for our daughter's nursery. it was delivered very quickly, in great condition. it did take a while to put together but it was not difficult.
Greatest pacifier I have ever found. My kiddos love them and when they out grow the pacifier I cut it off and they are able to keep their lovey for comfort.
Orange and Blue! Great product, very happy baby, durable, washes easily.<br />Chomp Chomp, bink, bink! It's great to be a Florida Gator...<br />GO GATORS!!!
fit in small escort perfectly! nice and snug. defiantly extra protective of your child . tall sides are great!! buy this car seat! you won't be disapointed!
very easy to put together and a great bookcase for the price! would not recommend in a children's room, unless you bolt it to the wall.  unit is very heavy!
no complaints. these work just like they are supposed to! we bought them for a trip to disney so baby brother wouldn't loose his toys while in the stroller.
EBF newborn took to this pacifier quickly and easily . . . 4 months later still prefers Dr. Brown's over any others!  Small nipple size is the key, I think.
My breastfed baby resisted taking 2 other pacifiers before trying this one.  I really like that they come with tops which makes carrying a spare super easy!
my grandson wouldn't put it down (unless he dropped it by accident). his particular goal was chewing on it, but the tunes and lights fascinated him as well.
this horse was bigger than expected.<br />really loved it.<br />the horse neighs and has a really nice sound when you shake it.<br />totally recommend it!!!
These are the cutest things, very good for a unique baby gift.  i got 3, two for friends of mine that are expecting and one for my 2 month old.  He loves it.
i bought this for my new grandson, but his three-and-a-half-year-old sister loves the music and has taken it over as her own. she'll share it with him later!
My son has reflux, and he loves his wubanub. We call him coco the monkey, and when he has coco, he squeezes him and never looses his pacifier. It's great. :)
These are the cutest things, and trust me after 3 brothers she is definitely the Princess. The pacifier just helps everyone else to know she is the Princess.
lovely quality, holds up well to the frequent washing that is inevitable with a baby, the colors stay true and the material doesn't pill like cheap clothing.
awesome. these give me so much ,ore space in my dish washer, and the parts lok cleaner too. it has a spot for the bloe valves at the botom of the bottle too.
love this stroller! best thing for my two boys! my oldest is 3, youngest is 10 months and it couldnt be more perfect! pleasantly surprised with every detail!
This is such a sweet gift. It's perfect for a newborn baby and does help hold the pacifier, that newborns often easily spit out. It really is a darling gift.
We absolutely love WubbaNubs! The elephant is no exception. It's the perfect size for my little guys hands and he loves it as a lovey, chew toy, and binkie :
my son loves this.it's a really good teething ring and easy for him to you. the seller was a hundred percent accurate with description and fast with delivery
these were for my daughter - she loves them. they arrived fine and are really cute.  the material is squishy and hopefully her little boy will love them too.
Even when it's not in his mouth he loves to hold onto it. We received the giraffe as a gift from my work, my son loved it so much that we had to buy another.
I had several friends who were having babies within months of each other.  I bought 2 blue pacifiers and 2 pink ones and each mother thought they were great!
Great price and so fun! My baby doesn't like many other pacifiers. Tommie Tippee evidently knows how to mimic an actual nipple when compared to other brands.
Bought this for a friend's baby.  They were excited to receive it because they were looking for it, and couldn't find it anywhere else!  It's soooooooo cute!
Impossible for my baby to spit her paci away now! This keeps it close enough that even if it's out of her mouth, she can get it back in! Genius idea! LOVE IT
sooo cute, plenty of room, and my kids love to use them!!!  the little details of the ears and trunk are super cute and, most importantly it keeps food cold!
This is a great pacifier for a newborn. This was the pacifier that they were using in the neonatal intensive care unit at the hospital and our baby loves it.
wonderful,beautiful playpen!!\\hard to find\\ square size is perfect & roomy for baby to play in!!! very colorful & well made!!would definitely recommend!!!!
i bought this mat for my son's playroom. he loves looking at the bright colors and learning the letters and numbers. it is easy to assemble and good quality.
These are wonderful. My baby loves them and they are beautiful. I like the fact that they glow in dark and makes it easier to find in the crib at night time.
These work great for my baby. The two larger bottles come with size two nipples instead of size one, so order extra size one nipples if you want to use them.
My baby loves this pacifier! I love the simple look and quality of the rubber. This is very durable, so far this pacifier has had no cracks or pieces broken.
My son loves this pacifier and its perfect for church! It is very soft and easy for him to keep in his mouth- not to mention its easy for me to keep up with!
This is the best thermometer ever.  You can take a child's temp without disturbing their sleep at all.<br />It does everything it says it will.<br />LOVE IT!
I gave this to my 2-month-old nephew for Christmas.  Not only is it adorable, but it is his FAVORITE pacifier.  He loves it, and we love watching him use it!
these pacifiers are my favorite for my son. they make it so much easier to find instead of blindly searching around in his crib in the dark for the pacifier.
i received my wall decor in good time..it was wrapped good..decal was placed on wall n looks great..i would recommend you ordering from them all went smooth.
this product is excellent!  i can fit 6 bottles, 2 full sets of pumping accessories, several pacifiers and several other items on it at once.  it's also cute.
It was tricky finding a case to fit the Philips Soothie pacifiers. This one fits wonderfully and I really like that it's hard plastic, as it is easy to clean.
our son loves this soothie! its the only thing he will use. he gags when we tired to give him the other kind of pacifier (he's so dramatic). he just loves it.
This was my granddaughter's fav so far - but she loves ALL her wubbies!!! She calls for them & if she drop one she says &#34;Oh Nooooo, Wubbieeeeeee&#34;. LOL
very simple to assemble. only complaint is that it sticks to the floor so you'll have to lift the chair to push your child closer to the table. great product.
We tried different styles and brands before and she didn麓t like them. But she likes this a lot. It works so she stops crying when there is nothing else to do.
So cute.  And I'm not too sure why but even when placed in the freezer (teething, only for a few minutes) they still glow after being in a drawer before hand.
Great thermometer! My son has had this one for five years and recommended it to me.  I love ours so much it has become one of the gifts I give to new parents.
We love these for the size and the fact that they're made of one piece of material.  Of course, none of that matters if your kid doesn't like them and our do.
great, but not the exact one you get at the hospital :(, the hospital ones are smaller, softer, and have a space cut out for the upper lip to make it comfier.
easy to hold, can be use with hot or cold beverages. quality is pretty good, thicker than our other stainless steel cups and prettier too. highly recommended!
My baby girl loves wubbaNub's! I bought the puppy & this one. When she would chew through the pacifier I would cut it off & she would still have her Elephant.
This is a gift for my soon to be niece, my brother complained that all the presents were too girly. This is the perfect fit to the little girls collection!!!!
I was worried that changing from the orthodontic type to the bulb type was going to disturb my little guy, but these work better for chewing on in my opinion.
We love this and will be sad to give it up when we hit the 6 month mark!  He sometimes will suck on any available piece which has been a source of fun for us.
the delivery time was good and the product was a great buy.  there were really more pieces than i needed for decor and i will give the extra stuff to friends.
use it for my elderly grandpas bed works like a charm ordering 2 more this week it saves me from changing the sheets twice a day highly recommend this product
i bought this one as a gift, but had 2 different britax back seat mirrors of my own and they are all great. convenient and a must have for rear facing kiddos.
love sproutware. measuring inside in case you want to know how much they are getting, my son loves using them. great for feeding and bringing snacks with you.
I purchased these for my granddaughter who isn't here yet.I'm sure she'll gets lots of use out them.They look like they would be the right size for a newborn.
this was a great addition to the care package i am putting together for a family member who is expecting. this mirror will be perfect for traveling with baby.
this is really a cute set that goes with all the other kitchen littles appliances.  nice and durable! makes a nice addiction to the other kitchen little sets.
Cute little bag! Love that it's made in the USA. The waterproof material on the inside is of much better quality than any other waterproof style bag I've had.
Great colors--requested by soon-to-be-mother. Should be better for baby not to swallow air like old pacifers. Ordered several so there will always be a spare.
Got this for my newborn who loves the soothie pacifiers. He already puts his arm around the little froggie. I'm sure he will grow to love his little wubbanub!
these little guys are so adorable and much larger then i imagined. i can't wait to hang them in my sons nursery. perfect touch to his sports theme. love them!
I like that these are clear.  Unfortunately my daughter stopped using a pacifier, but when she did use it, I liked being able to still see her beautiful face.
We tried about six other different (more expensive!) brands and yet these are the only pacifiers my 6 month old will take. Such a lifesaver in long car rides!
i choose this rating because it got here when it said it would.<br />My grandson really loves it alot.<br />and yes i would recommend this product to any one.
We are very happy with our new little monkey paccie! It's just as pictured and we have used these products before. Easily washable and easy to find if dropped.
love this turtle.  my son falls asleep to it for every nap and at bedtime.  works like a charm.  the waves are really cool.  i would definitely recommend this.
the seller sent the towel very quickly. it's our favorite for our little one . it's so soft and absorbent but not bulky like most cotton towels. we all love it
this is a great potty seat! it fits great to the seat as it adjusts to fit snug. it doesn't slide around on the seat like other ones i've purchased. i love it!
They really do glow in the dark, which is a wonderful thing when it's the middle of the night and you're delirious from sleep deprivation.  Highly recommend!!!
This is a great item to have around. It makes it easy to sterilize paci's and even nipples from bottles. We use this daily. Would make a great shower gift too!
This was requested by my granddaughter. She is acquiring all that she needs before the birth of our great grand baby. This will be helpful in the early months.
installs in a second and works perfectly. i love how when you use this adaptor you can use both sunshades, the one on the stroller and the one on the car seat.
Excellent product.  My granddaughter loves these pacifiers.  Now we don't worry so much when they fall to the floor when we are out and about in public places.
I tried several pacifier brands and my girl loved this one the best. No issues with breastfeeding when we introduced it, which is what some people worry about.
as grandparents, we purchased these for our granddaughter. the pricey disposable diapers were giving her baby boy a diaper rash as well as these do save money.
nice lightweight fabric valance with large rod pocket. really liked that the design wasn't too infantile or juvenile. we are using it in a pediatric exam room.
This is the ONLY paci my breastfed baby would take.  It is pricey and not the most attractive pacifier on the market but they are good quality baby loves them.
Our baby loves these. We ended up buying a different style nipple though, just to get her to be flexible. She doesn't have a problem switching between the two.
this shield fits perfect on my chicco keyfit 30. does a nice job of shielding the baby from sun and insects. haven't figured out how to fold it back up though.
Amazin product great great great my kid love them they have good material and safe for babys... I would love them in another color like clear because is unisex
i could not find a cup for my son and he drank from this one during the first try!! great cup, doesn't leak and very easy to use. can't go wrong with this cup!
You simply cannot see a kid with any of these and not laugh - cannot be done.  Got these for the granddaughter and getting a picture simply cannot go unshared.
these are fantastic. we have twin boys and we use these sleep sacks every night. i use them for bed with a long sleeve onesie, they sleep comfortably and warm.
purchased these in addition to the paytex drop in bottles as my son was too young to use the medium flow nipples yet. they work great! love these bottles also.
Love our wubbanubs! She played with them and didn't suck on them after we ordered more but the first one she had that we lost was awesome! Definitely recommend
really fun game to play, got a laugh out of the group trying to stick the dummy on babies face, pretty cheaply made but good for a fun game at the baby shower.
this is super cute!  and i got it for a great price.  it's for my 1.5 year old and it fits her well.  the quality is decent and i love that it covers her ears.
great seat and super comfy for my 4 year old. recommended by the national highway traffic safety administration. cheaper than britax, but quality just as good!
i had this product when my children were babies and loved it then!  you can use a regular bathtub hands free and the babies love being submerged in warm water.
great buy for a high chair that fits all the basic needs for a child!! mine still in the kitchen  waiting for my 2nd baby to come! sturdy and very functional!!
Before coming across this pacifier, we had tried 3 different kinds of pacifiers and neither one of our 2 babies liked them. Finally Natursutten saved us... :-)
My boys love these. It gives them a nice sense of security almost like Linus' blanket. I bought multiple so that we didn't have to worry about where they were.
my boys love these. it gives them a nice sense of security almost like linus' blanket. i bought multiple so that we didn't have to worry about where they were.
He loves this .he holds on to it can not go without it and he is 3 weeks old .if you have a baby or grandchild I recommend  you get as many as you can of these.
I love these pacifiers for the first few months. They are like the ones from the hospital and are super easy to clean. Very happy they come in girly colors too!
this is the cadillac escalade of baby buggies.  bought for my daughter as a baby shower gift.<br />durable and the combo of car seat and carriage can't be beat.
My baby loves these! When she was brand new she didn't really like them but now that she is older, she loves them! It's the only kind she really uses anymore :]
i ordered two and they work great. they are secure in the shower and don't budge. easy to move to a different spot but helpful in keeping a person from falling.
easy to assemble.  sturdy and well made.  i am going to put cushions on the top to double as extra seating in my office/craft room.  i bought two and love them.
i just bought this monitor and i love it. the quality of the night vision is excellent. all of the options are great. the audio is overall good.  dont hesitate!
I love these and my son prefers them over all other brands. The colors are soft and subtle. Very cute and they stay in the mouth! Perfect size for young babies.
My baby loves her Lamby!  We got one as a shower gift and I bought another one as a back up because she loves it so much.  This is by far my favorite baby item.
I love every thing about this pacifier! Doesn't look like it's made cheap either...the mustache has grooves in it to make it look more like real hair!! AWESOME!
my only complaint with this is that its not 2ftx1ft.  its small and fits on the counter great and helps dry all of the different parts of a pump and bottle set.
Although my suga mama is way too old for this pacifier it is soooo cute and I love when she says where is her herraife, we did loose it but it was way worth it.
easy to install and very sturdy, my daughter did however figure it out quickly and ended up pinching her arm badly i. the parts of the gate that slide together.
he loves them, and i love that i can put them through the washer (even though it states to surface clean). i like to attach one to his carseat to play with. :-)
My 3 month old has loved this since she was 2 weeks old. She can hold its paws and keep it by her mouth, and it is easy for me to find at night if she drops it.
this toddler bed is awesome!  my granddaughter is almost 3 years old and she just loved her new bed!  she outgrew the pack & play and this was a perfect option.
This mustachifier says &#34;I will complete the 72 oz. steak challenge at the local saloon.&#34;  It turns your little baby into a country ladykiller instantly.
Every Princess' baby daughter needs a Princess pacifier to begin her reign!  Pretty white and pastel pink coloring with glitter and a crown emblem on the front!
We were looking for a pacifier for our 6 month old that was ok for a growing mouth and this did the trick. She uses it only at night but it fits her mouth well.
This went up with no problems and stayed up with no problems.  What a transformation in my bedroom for why it cost much cheaper than a picture and looks great!!
Baby loves his wubbanubs! Zebra is super cute and attractive to baby due to the black and white high contrast. The easiest of our wubbanubs to find in the dark.
My son was born in 2012- year of the dragon, so this was perfect!  It's absolutely adorable and very detailed with the cute blue wings which is ideal for a boy.
Only pacifier that works. I now what to reorder, but the picture shows a bottle????<br /><br />What am I ordering, the item name or what's on the picture??? :-)
my daughter is 6 months old, 26.5&#34;.  she fits perfectly in this sleepsack.  she loves it because it is soft, warm, and comfortable.  plenty of leg room too.
Wonderful because my four month old son could manipulate it himself after just a few days. Saved lots of time searching for a pacifier, especially when driving!
very cute bath toy for a frog fan.  floats and hasn't gotten icky yet, though it may just be a matter of time, bath toys just seem to do that.  great price too.
this dummy is hilarious. i bought it as a joke for a friend and i'm sure it will be well received. hope she uses it on the baby becaise it will look hilarious!!
we bought one of these items for our family years ago and our friend thought it would be good for her grandson. they love it. thank you for a great transaction.
super cute and soft. i am still pregnant but i am excited to use this for my lo. it get's a little chilly at night and these seems cozy enough to keep her warm.
These are the best and are darling. I had them for my kids and I buy one for every baby shower. I can't resist them. A binkie and a stuffy! What could be cuter!
love this pregnancy pillow!  it's the perfect length for me (i'm 5'6&#34; and overweight).  noticed a lessening of back pain shortly after i started using this.
It keeps the pacifier in with a &#34;light&#34; amount of pressure.  Everyone sleeps better.  You can easily tuck it into the swaddle as well.  Highly recommend!
My son (3 mos old) loves these and everyone gets a kick out of seeing him with them in his mouth!  They're a hoot!  Just as durable as any other pacifier we use.
My baby love it! And I think  it is the best pacifier to stay in baby's mouth. And the little animals makes it even more cuter and easy to baby hands to hold it.
we have been very satisfied with this car seat. i researched for weeks and finally ordered the britax roundabout. it is comfortable and secure. thank you britax!
avent pacifiers rule.  my nieces came home from the hospitals with them and my sister swears by this mold.  a pair is always included for every baby shower gift.
My daughter loves her WubbaNub so much so that we have had to buy spares! Super cute, just wish she hadn't gotten attached to one of the most expensive ones! LOL
my wife says:<br />i love this!  my baby sleeps directly on it.  it is soft unlike the old ones that were stiff and uncomfortable.  i will be buying another one.
My little one loves this pacifier. I also like how the pacifier comes with its own case to help keep it clean. Plus I love the unique skull. Shipping was prompt.
So soft, and latex free pacifier. Any baby will love this in a carseat so they can hold it. Buy more than one and a different animal for each baby for multiples!
Fantastic!So much better than snapping it on to their clothing!They have the pacifier,as well as,a toy!!I would recommend this for any new mother or grandmother!
absolutely love it! it goes with my nephew's bedroom theme. contemporary without being too bulky. love the stickers. my brother and sister-in-law are so pleased.
I don't know why these didn't exist sooner!  They are perfect in the middle of the night when so you don't have to fish around for passy in the crib in the dark!
I have foster babes and they all love this brand. Our children's hospital uses it. Buying the six pack means I can always find one when I need to (well usually).
This is a great little paci keeper and I can manage to fit a Soothie and an ortho in it. I put it inside a small pocket in her diaper bag and we are ready to go.
This is so wonderful! I love that it dries everything! Such a time saver! Plus it gives extra piece of mind knowing the bottles/pump parts/pacis are extra clean!
the best pacifiers for babies. my younger 2 only took these as bitty babies.  its hard to attach paci-catchers to these without an adapter, but not impossible :D
My kid loved to traditional avent pacifier. I decided to try these and they worked really well also! Cute and easy to hang onto with the more traditional handle.
life saver!  we attach this to the high chair when we are out, the car seat, and the stroller.  they keep toys from hitting the ground and needing to be cleaned.
I had a hard time getting my baby to take a pacifier, but we had the most success with this one, and it didn't leave marks on her face like the plastic ones did.
i love how absorbent and trim these are. i can use alone or add just one of these as a doubler during the night and my 7 month old will last all night 10+ hours!
Super cute.  Baby loves it.  Much cheaper online than in the stores.  Seems to be good quality.  We ended up buying a pink giraffe too because they work so well.
this bottle newborn feeding set is the best! my daughter loves all dr.brown麓s bottles! the bottle reduces the air intake in the child's mouth and prevents colic!
my son loves his wubbanub. it helps keep the pacifier in their mouth when they are nb and when they get older its easier for them to find and put in their mouth!
My son loves this pacifier. The bright color was easy to find when looking in my diaper bag. It is also very flexible and fits in any pocket when your on the go.
My baby's favorite pacifiers. The glow in the dark only works for a short time and is very dim so don't buy it expecting it to glow all night. Its also orthotic.
This is very cute, and it comes with a cover for the nipple part. I am taking it to a baby shower, and will probably get lots of comments on it. I'm very excited!
I love this!  got it for my daughter(3 wks old) and the stuffed animal really helps nubbie stay in place instead of falling like it normally would. i recommend it
My son loves these pacifiers.  Every other brand he spits out, but these are great.  They also have a little space around the mouth, so that spit doesn't collect.
I love this product. My child could not get by without this. This perfect for breast feeding mothers. It also allows you to see anything inside your babies mouth.
Whoever thought of glow in the dark pacifiers is a genius. These are wonderful. If my son loses it in the night he can find it himself and go right back to sleep!
my  grandson and his wife are expecting their 1st baby.  they are both gator fans.  i will include this with the other baby items for the baby shower.  thank you!
If you are a Hello Kitty fan, these are a must for your little princess!  They are exactly like the regular NUK pacifier 6-18 months, just adorned with awesome HK
i received this item fairly quickly and it was still in its original wrapping.  i am very positively impressed with this purchase.  highly recommend!  thank you:)
i previously ordered the graco twin bassinet but realized i may need to separate the twins so they can sleep if one is awake and vice versa. this should be great!
Baby loves it. Pediatric Dentist Suggested. A bit expensive and we all love free shipping but worth it to save on dental bills later. Would recommend to a friend.
I bought it for my baby that don't born yet. But i think that she will love it because i read a lot of things i listen a lot of people and everybody recommend it.
my 5 month old will only take this kind of binky. i can only find the green ones and pink and purple ones in store so i was super excited when i found this color.
I had a friend who was having some difficulty getting her baby to suck during feedings. I bought this for her and now the baby sucks again. Thanks Dallas Cowboys!
i have been using this for almost 3 years now and it has worked very well. of course by now it has some signs of wear, but i was very pleased to buy this product.
It is nice and deep so pacifier won't fall out even if the Velcro is not closed. Light weight, also due to Velcro. Fit around any diaper bag strap or a belt loop.
we wanted a nicer mattress for baby in the bassinet portion of our graco cuddle cove pack n play. this fits snugly and provides firm support for baby. good price!
a friend turned me on to these scissors, and i'm so grateful. they make nail-cutting so much less terrifying. i'll be buying these for all the new parents i know.
I luv it and my daughter luvs it too. I've ordered this product before and i will continue ordering til my daughter grows out of it.. no more losing her pacifier.
I brought this for my 1mo old grandaughter because she is always grabbing and reaching for things, mainly her face. This worked wonders:) Perfect and Adorable!!!!
We have had three kids who all loved Soothie binkies more than any other. I love that they are one piece and all silicone so it is easy to boil them to disinfect.
My daughter Loves this binky! it is perfect for me because i cant loose it in my bag and she can grab it and get it into her mouth by herself! It is so adorable!!
i love it!!! looks very nice....holds lots of toys.  i bought a cushion for the top and i use it as a bench for my grandson to sit and ready when his not playing.
i looked all over for a base that had the level on it.  thank goodness we found them on here! :) we bought 2 extras - one for ganny's car and one for daddy's car!
Great product! Contoured tip fits great and comfortably into my sons mouth. Have tried multiple types of pacifiers and this is the only type my son will tolerate.
the only bibs for age 2 and up! it catches everything and my toddler and child can scoop up their lost food and eat it by themselves! so easy to clean and sturdy.
i love this contoured changing table pad and actually works well with other teddy bear bedding sets. especially geenny and eddie bauer and of course jojo designs.
My son loves this pacifier and I love being able to find it in his car seat when it comes out of his mouth. My only SMALL problem is that he likes to pull it out.
These were the only pacifiers our baby liked, I just had multiple because I seemed to misplace often. The best part about these are the same as the wubbanubs use.
my baby shaniqua loved looking like a hippo after her bath. these robes are so fun and we had great customer service, they accommodated every request that we had!
this is such a great present for  any baby! they are cute, fashionable and comfy. perfect for your baby or for anyone you know having a baby! this is a must buy!!
These are great... Real hard plastic that my little puppy can't gnaw through when he steals them...these are the only ones I've found that are stronger than him!!
good little caddy for our babyjogger.  please with the quality to price ratio.  the top edge has a wire running around it so it keeps its shape for the most part.
Perfect deal, faster shipment, recommended to all, A++++++++<br />I made a comparison with similar and for me this was the best choice and the purchase was great.
Nice finishing. It works for what it was ment to be. My baby is 3 weeks old and this still a bit big for him but in 2 more weeks I am sure it will fit him perfect
I had seen a baby with this pacifier and thought it was cute.  I purchased it for my grandchild.  It is real cute and her mom had wanted it without my knowing it.
i have used several bibs on my son. however dibs on bibs is number one. its huge and the food/drink does not leak through bib. its number one in my book. thanks!!
They are awesome!  So cute and keeps the pacifier in the babies mouth. It also makes it easier to find. I give them for gifts as well because I like them so much.
This is a good quality pacifier, and with the mustache it is special!  There are types other than the cowboy, so you can get the look you want for your little one.
I purchased  these for my twin granddaughters. They love the hello kittys.  I should have ordered another package, because they keep loosing them around the house!
My kid didn't love paci's but if we could get him to take one this was the only one he would take.  Seems like its lighter and easier for him to hold in his mouth?
very good quality and it looks adorable. it would make a lovely gift, my son's pictures turned out so cute with this pacifier and the style is a little different .
We have other Wubbanubs but wanted something different. This is a very cute pony and matches many outfits. The baby likes this paddy just as well as his first one.
Love the wubbanubs! Can't find them locally! My newborn grew out of the Soothie pretty quickly and switched to a regular pacifier but she liked to hold the animal.
purchased product to counter issue with electrical interference with old baby monitor.  works great, only negative is that it has very bright operating led lights.
My two children have both used and LOVE the &#34;soothies.&#34; These were exactly as listed and were shipped quickly. I would recommend these pacifiers to anyone.
these wall decals are easy to apply, and easy to reposition! couldn't beat the price either! would highly recommend as this looks adorable in a little girls rooms.
My nephew loved this thing.  He loved being able to hold onto the dog while sucking on the nipple part.  Helped him with his hands and learning how to hold things.
we somehow lost a ring to one of our bottles.  this fit the bill and, more importantly, fit our supply of philips avent classic bottles (the 4 oz, 9 oz and 11 oz).
good size for little hands to hold.  good quality.  nice bright colors.  gave to my grandson at 6 months and he still chooses them to play with at almost 9 months.
My daughter wasn't impressed at first.. I kept offering it to her and after about the 4th or 5th time she decided she liked it.. now she won't take any other kind!
Another one I ordered for my granddaughter.Easy for her to hold and she calls it her binky boo.Even tho she is 15 months old,she still wants this kind of pacifier.
They last a long time, I can only find the blue ones online.<br />They sell pink at walgreens for girls.<br />Only passifier my 10 month old will take since birth.
My baby nephew loves the pacifier. It looks like he's kissing a dinosaur. Its his favorite pacifier and one of his favorite toys. Its basically a two for one deal.
easy for him to grasp & hold, and i'm not picking it up off the floor all the time.  the rubber is soft and squeezy and he loves the shape.  not stinky like others
my granddaughter loves it.  makes managing her pacifier so much easier.  She can get it back in place by herself and loves playing<br />with the legs of the turtle.
This was one of the many pacifier we tried with my breast fed baby. Hard to leave a review bc she ended up just not wanting any pacifier. But the delivery was fast.
I gave it to my niece for her baby girl who was teething. It worked great and is an excellent alternative to medicine. Fast shipping and very good price. Thank you!
my daughter hates it. she can't get past it. now we have peace of mind knowing that she won't get under our feet in the kitchen. great should have bought it sooner.
great stuff. it smells good, is gentle on the skin, cleans well, and lasts a long time. for over 8 months starting when my baby was a newborn, i've had no problems.
this is a really nice babybook and it is not at highway robbery prices. remember this is just paper and plastic. how some of the companies ask so much is beyond me.
I bought these for my 4 month old daughter and they have quickly become her favorite and now ONLY pacifiers she will use. Great quality and easy to clean/sterilize.
Second time buying the cow, my dog ate the first one. He gets a little dingy because of the white but we just toss it in the wash machine and it comes out like new!
so cute and pretty. the light pink beads on the top wings don't show up as much in real life as it does in the photo, but i still love it for my little girl's room.
these are great and come with lids for all 3 bowl sizes. similar bowls by munchkin used to come with all 3 lids but now only come with 1 lid for the smallest bowl!!
super happy. i thought i only ordered one case but got 4 for this price!  look exactly like the picture and love the how they feel. they fit perfect on my galaxy s4
i really like this belt for my son who's 18 months (weighs 27lbs). i like the ease of the belt and not having to worry about poking holes in belts that are too big.
These temp pacifiers are great!! Easy to read and are accurate.. A easy way to get that temp when your baby doesn't feel good.. Great quality.. Highly reccommend :)
Product is a bigger version of the 0-6 months pacifier i liked those pacifiers so i bought the 6 - 18 month pacifier and the baby is happy can't ask more than that!
My daughter loves these and wont take any other pacifier. They are easy for her to hold. She's been using these pacifiers since birth and she's almost 5 months old.
These are my daughters favorite pacifiers! We have three dogs who love to steal them so I am constantly buying new ones. I have the best luck with prices on AMAZON!
i love this halo sleepsack, my baby is 2 months old and we have used it frequently because he does not like to have his arms swaddled but stays warm in this fleece.
this is a great baby calendar. it has premade stickers to place on the calendar when appropriate.  this is a must have to keep track of your baby's accomplishments.
my wife has this by her side every second we got our boy in bed. i catch her checking monitor, moving it around and zooming in and out lol! it's been awesome for us
I purchased this for a baby shower gift. It is absolutely adorable, comes with protective cover to protect the nipple. Was delighted with quality and fast shipment.
my baby daughter will only use this kind of pacifier. she is breastfeed and she would not take the other kinds, especially  the orthodontic kind with the funny end.
My baby girl could not keep a binkie in her mouth. My friend recommended the Wubbanub and my baby was able to keep in the binkie and hold onto the cute little lamb.
I love this thing! It is so adorable when my daughter sucks on it! She hates pacifiers- except for this one. She plays with the bear and loves her &#34;wubbie.&#34;
a perfect toy for the car seat. i don't have to worry about toys falling out of his seat. he bats at the toys and they make sounds and play music. easy money spent.
My daughter LOVES her WubbaNub's! We have purchased 6 different types so far. She will not use anything else.<br /><br />PERFECT GIFT for anyone who is expecting!!!

Purchased for my granddaughter and she loved it. Easy to find. Also bought her the caterpillar and little doll. Hospital recommended. They last a long time as well.
i love this wearable blanket.  it's very soft and warm, and not static as acrylic is.  i wish they made them in bigger sizes, i can't find anything like it anymore.
We keep this strapped to the baby's carseat so we are never far from a clean pacifier in public. Great concept! It never opens on it's own, has a good 'lock' to it.
the bag is perfect for my son's stuffs...diapers, small toys, milk, small food and few clothes. the bag is very spacious and very convenient to take anywhere we go.
He absolutely loves his giraffe.  It stays in his crib easier then a regular pacifier, which can fall between the slats.  He loves holding on the the cuddly giraffe.
this seat is great!  my 3 year old daughter loves it, she is able to sit at the table and it is comfortable.  we even used it our atv side by side rzr, worked great!
These were recommended to me by a nurse and they are great - they are smaller and nicer on my daughter's face!  They hold up wonderfully and the six pack is perfect!
Not sure why, but after trying several brands my son only likes this ones<br />they are vented, so you can also fill it with water, freeze it and use it for teething
i use this as a second car seat and take it on travel. it is light, easy to install and comfortable. my 22 mth old daughter loves sitting in it. highly recommend it.
My granddaughter loves her wubbanubs. She has several different animals.  They are well made ... soft and cuddly.  Pacifier is securely attached.  Worth every penny.
when my hubby was in nh he needed a hamper and i got this one. it's size was great and all the staff & hubby loved it. it's a great way to bring a smile to your day!
like all avent products, I found an excellent product, can not speak to their quality as I am not the one who uses them, but I think my daughter is happy to use them
We get so many comments on this from people just passing by.  His first bday party is going to be a mustache bash now that he's known as the mustache baby.  Love it.
The baby loved this pacifier.  Plus it was fun because he got a lot of double takes and laughs with it.  It was very unexpected to see a happy baby- with a mustache.
these work great. the baby had a hard time with other &#34;newborn&#34; pacifiers because the nipple was too long. these are just right and he takes them right away.
I bought this for my granddaughter and she loves it!  But the best part? It is so much fun!  People love to respond when they see it!  Very happy with this purchase!
My grandson loves his Wubbanub. He is able to keep this pinky in his mouth while the others would just pop right out.  He gets soon excited when he sees his 'Wubby'!
i love love love these! they are adorable and easy to apply to the walls in my baby's room. there doesn't seem like a lot of stickers but there really is! great buy!
Wonderful d茅cor for our granddaughter's room,, done in dragon flies and woodland animals.  we got a yellow and green one also arrived in a quick manner she loves it.
wonderful item, it serves a great purpose: to keep my baby from running off into parking lots, etc. and it doubles as a small diaper bag, that she can carry herself.
i love this! it fits perfectly on my changing table topper on the dresser i ordered. it's exactly what i expected... love it! would definitely recommend to a friend.
amazing! my son was potty trained, but wouldn't use a toilet, just his little potties. we took this thing everywhere. now we just keep it in the car for emergencies.
good buy for the price. keeps your little one safe and secure while comfortable.  allows for growing with the child, with no need to replace at each stage of growth.
it's an awesome car seat. i like how sturdy this seat is. the only thing i don't like is its easy to open top buckle for a toddler. but on flip slide easy for me too
We haven't tried the monkey yet but we have the giraffe and my son loves it even at a month old he wrapped his little arms around it while sucking it washes well too
Our 2 month old has loved these pacifiers since birth. We bought the 6 pack so we could have them in the diaper bag and around the house at all times. Super helpful.
My baby wasn't big on the pacifiers. We tried pretty much every brand out there and these are all she would take. We are still using mam at 3 months and loving them.
my mother-in-law just bought it for my 5.5 months old baby girl. she did not take it out of her mouth for 2 hours! i think her razberry has some serious competition.
These are just like the Soothie pacifiers babies get in the hospital but in pretty girlie colors! I thought they were way cuter than the big Green one they give you!
The pacifiers came just in time for my trip to see my grandson.  He absolutely loves only these types of soothies and they work so well.  Fast delivery great service.
was hesitant to purchase because of the price, but it is so adorable and much larger then i expected. we are using it as toy storage for our infant and it is perfect!
We had a blast seeing our son use this pacifier. He doesn't take a pacifier very long usually but it kept this one long enough to give us a few laughs and great pics!
I bought 3 for my baby boy and want them all now! It really helped him learn how to put his paci in his mouth and its so adorable when he cuddles with it! Recommend!!
Bought these for a baby shower. Couple went to South Carolina and are expecting their first child.  These are great and are being sent to a baby shower in California.
I now have the classiest baby on the block!<br /><br />I would highly recommend this product. If only so you can know what your baby will look like as a classy adult.

great product. easy to install my daughters crib is next to an outlet that we put this on. it has done its job. ordered another one for the baby we are expecting now.
I love tomme tippee.. I trust this product so much... My daughter's love the pacifier because it's so soft and harmless for the baby specially for the new born baby..
I love this!  It's so cute and my daughter loves that she has something to hold on to.  She actually pulls her pacifier out less since she is holding onto the animal.
blocks were just what my daughter wanted for her baby girl. so, as grandfather i had to get them.<br />they arrived on time and were exactly what we were looking for.
We got one of these pacifiers at the hospital when my baby was born. I bought others after we came home but he really liked these best. I recommend them for any baby.
works great on my car windows so far. i just stuck it on and then smoothed it out with a credit card.<br />i like that i don't have to worry about it being dangerous.
i put this together by myself in an hour, the instructions were simple and it was a breeze. it's super sturdy and looks beautiful with the rest of my oak furniture :)
JUST like the ones they give you in the hospital (but they never give you more than one so if you lose it you're out of luck!) but in cute colors! Highly reccomended!
I love these wubbanub's. this one is super cute girly and durable! My 15month old has no<br />Problum trying to find it in her crib when she is sleeping. It's awsome!
This item was for my grandson. He lives on the other side of the country. I have no personal experience with him and the teether. However, I am told that he loves it.
I ordered this for my great grand baby. She loves it - in fact it is about the only pacifier she will take. I would definitely recommend it to anyone with a new baby.
Good to keep the pacifier clean.  I keep it all the time in the baby carry bag.  Unfortunately, my grandson doesn't like the pacifier by the time he was 5 months old.
I got this as a baby gift for a friend. Hopefully her and her baby will love it. My little girl has 4 and is completely attached to them. These Wubbanub's are magic!!
they were just what the mother to be was looking for. soft, colors are brighter than they appear on the website, that makes them a greater asset to the babies warmth.
this is the one to buy, as far as toddler step stools go.  easy for the 4yo to move around and use.  also sturdy and inexpensive. i wish i'd bought this one long ago.
We love that this paci is exactly the brand my son loves, doesn't fall far if it falls out of his mouth, and is easy to find in the night because if the sie and feel.
very nice quality; very soft.  these are more expensive than other pads, but i found them to be worth the moeny and purchased extras for the nursery and my diaperbag.
What a great deal on something that you'll always need tons of-and they are great, bright colors. I am so happy that I found these-and free 2 day shipping-so helpful!
Best invention ever! My daughter started using it right away and it is so nice when we're in the car, we don't have to worry about losing a pacifier during the drive!
We have several Wubbas at our house and they're a huge hit with our 5 month old. He can play with it and grab it all on his own. It also works great for soothing him.
we love sophie the giraffe. my six month old can't get enough of her - great teether and easy for her to grasp. would definitely recommend this to anyone with kiddos.
wish it was for 6-12 months...little small for my 8 month old but the frog is cute.  I would recommend to a younger baby.  My bad for not seeing the months suggested.
the single most used item we have ever gotten for our son we now own 6 of them makes it easier for him to manipulate and gets tons of compliments cuz its just so cute
We have 2 and they are both awesome and easy to find around the house. My daughter loves grabbing the stuffed animal and putting the pacifier in her mouth on her own.
This product was perfect and so cute! The shipping was fast and the item was as expected. Very pleased with this purchase. It was a gift and it was very well received.
perfect for taking around town and everywhere we go while potty training. well, my daughter is a champ, what can i say, but this has been helpful keeping her on track.
hahahahahahahahahahahahahaha my wife thinks its just a reason for me to keep my mustache hahahahaha he looks so awesome its the coolest thing i have ever bought my son
love these- no need for dryer sheets, i put a drop of lavender essential oil on mine if to make my laundry smell fresher and i really feel it cuts down on drying time!
great for keeping baby warm in northern canada! i would recommend going up a size then what you normally are wear for extra room! loved it! can't wait to use it again!
At first, the duck helped keep the pacifier in our son's mouth, but as he got older, it provided hours of entertainment as well. Also, he does not lose it in his crib.
About the size of a small womens hand. Perfect for first my essential oil first aid kit. You could probably fit two ish handfuls of cheerios in here if that helps too.
this product works well in my daughter's nursery....it was a nice addition to all the other jojo ladybug parade items that we have purchased for her new addition......
I bought this as a gift for my friend for her baby shower. As of yet, the baby has not been born, so I don't know how it is rated as a pacifier. But it is ADORABLE!!!!
my baby loves this!  it's soft and snugly.  she takes naps in it daily.  and o can take it on road trips so she has a place to lounge. wish they made it in adult size!
i bought this couch for my nephews second birthday and he absolutely loved it! it is a weird kind of material and it is hard to clean, but other than that its perfect!
i love this dogie, it's the cutest squeaky toy ever! baby loves it too. it's super soft and squeaks when squeezed and it's really adorable. i love everything about it.
love this thing!  it fits just about everything and i can throw it in the wash as-is.  i can usually get the belt to wrap around something to keep her secured as well.
Product got lost in the mail and they were great about sending out another one. The product was just as promised and I would definately do business with them again. :)
We love the Wubbanub! My only wish would be for the pacifier to be rated hire than 6 months. Still worth 5 stars. Easy to wash, easy to find, and well worth the money!
Thank you so much it's just what I wanted it actually came earlier than expected which was great thank you again I will definitely be purchasing more from this seller.
i bought as a gift for a friend and it was a hit. the baby is not born yet so i can't tell you that he liked it, but i am sure that we will have a lot of fun pictures.
its great, waterproof and very warm. looks smart and just as nice as more expensive versions. perfect for the east coast winter. plus faster than anticipated delivery.
My newborn will only take the hospital style soothes and I was so glad to see these sold on Amazon. I love that they come in a pretty purple and pink color for her. :)
We have gotten plenty of laughs from this passy for our son. Worth the fun and reaction of others. He liked using it as well once he got old enough for how big it was.
works great. suction works well but not to hard to where i am worried that take to much of a suction. that was my number one concern and my friend recommend this kind.
I wish I would have though of this!! So much easier to find a pacifier when the baby drops it! Especially in the middle of the night! Not to mention how cute they are.
The mustacho is a bit large for newborns. The plastic rubs against his cheeks and nose. It causes chafing. Other than that, the nipple was supple & super cute for pics
easy clean up and easy to clean under it. i love the harness it keep my daughter in the chair and i know she is safely strapped in because she can be an escape artist.
My 4 week old can keep these in for a while on her own. Some she won't take some fall out easily but these seem to be doing the trick! Love that they glow in the dark!
sleep sack was large enough to last through a year's worth of growth and keep my grandchild warm through a minnesota winter.  high quality fleece and just as pictured.
I was always a fan of the Soothie pacifiers but didn't like how big they were around. I think these are just what I needed. My son loves them and the Blue is so pretty.
This pacifier is light and shaped right.Soft and consists of whole thing not different parts. Our son's favorite pacifier.It lets him breath as it has a space for nose.
these stickers are well made and super cute!  so far we have used the one month one and really enjoyed having it! the older children are having fun taking the pictures!
My lo  was teething and the drool was hanging out under her bink causing a rash that wouldn't go away. A few days with these and it's gone. We're sticking to these now.
just used the go glass bottle for the first time and love it!! more importantly my one month old loves it! super cute as well 馃槃 easy to clean definitely recommend 馃憤馃徎
i bought this for my niece and fits perfectly with her pretty in purple bedroom theme. the quality is soft yet sturdy and has survived many washes without color fading.
My sons LOVED and LOVE these, and have since birth.  Ingenious idea and highly recommend!  My 15 month old uses at bedtime for both his pacifier and his &#34;lovie&#34;
super cute and comfy. my son loves it because he can see out of the window much easier. it also feels much safer and sturdier than the bucket carseat. highly recommend.
i already have one but bought a second for our second changing area. you don't realize how well these work until you try using a regular trash can for a diaper garbage.
These are the 3 month+, even though they don't say that.  Very excellent, daughter likes them.  She is starting to teeth a little, and she chews on them.  Hold up good!
i really like the babybjorn baby carrier. it is easy to adjust and my little one is really comfortable in it. he usually falls asleep within minutes of being put in it.
Try these pacifiers first, I wish I had. My baby loves these, I only wish we could attach a clip somehow. No matter, I am sticking with these as long as he adores them.
wish my daughter would've liked them. she didn't like ANY pacifiers. she's almost 1 now and we gave up. at least we don't have to worry about her not wanting to let go.
good quick sale. the bottles that arrived didn't match the ones in the pic which i didn't expect but turned out happier anyway as i got the bottles i originally wanted.
My daughter doesn't use a pacifier, but this is great for her to nibble on while she's having trouble falling asleep.  She loves it and it's easy for her to keep close.
This is the only pacifier my granddaughter would take. We loved the scent and she loved the taste of it. We went thru several! Great size and perfect fit for her mouth.
great addition to our bedding set!  love how it ties neatly at the end of the crib for easy access.  out of the way, but still a nice accent to add to the room's d茅cor.
I like that they make a clicking sound from the handle hitting the shield when they drop, so you can somewhat tell where they go in the middle of the dark night ;) hha.
i love this chair! i take it with me every time i head out of town or to a restaurant. i love its small size, portability, and practical design. it's easy to use clean.
way easier for my 1-year- old to hold and get to her mouth than the super long and kinda skinny nuby ones i also have. these are definitely well designed for a learner!
One of the BEST purchase for our daughter, yet!  (4 months old).  :). It stays put, it a perfect for in the car seat, and she loves playing and talking to the lamb.....
nice gift for a one year old - the straw is unique in that you can tip the sippy cup and still drink from the straw which is good for new drinkers.  plus it is stylish!
She loves it and it's helping with the teething.  It makes me feel a lot better that it's not plastic and made out of real rubber.  Wish I had known about these sooner!
So of course I can't NOT have my baby represent the NY Yankees, born and bred, perfect quality and very durable the vinyl colors don't seem to be wearing off. I LOVE IT
Great pacifiers. So great, my dogs won't stop eating them. I'm convinced they smell like dog treats so that I have to continue buying pacifiers each month. Conspiracy?!
love the safety features, it's a bit big when it's rear facing, so we had to place it in the middle of our back seat, but it seems very comfortable and my son loves it!
best crib sheet we have ever purchased. we look for the aden and anais brand when we buy anything for the kids. hopefully they will start making adult size options soon
i bought this pink color summer training cup when my daughter was  2 years old. she loves it. now i am finding hard to change her bottle from training cup to sippy cup.
Our twins prefer Dr. Browns over any other pacifier they have tried. The handles can be distracting for them when they are going to sleep, so we usually cut those off .
These are just like the one they gave my daughter in the hospital.  After so many knockoff purchases that she wouldn't use I finally purchased these and they are great!
so far so good. no leaks, small setting fits perfectly on my newborn (7lbs-12oz) and poo easily wipes off if when i am changing him some accidentally gets on the cover.
no fluff here. it is what it is and it serves its purpose in protecting the crib rails. fits our wider front crib rail. easy to apply. toy tethers are a great addition.
My son loves his WubbaNub so much I had to share with others and purchased this one for a gift.  I've noticed having something on his chest gives him security at night.
After getting used to these in the hospital, these are the only pacifiers our granddaughter will accept, so it's great to be able to buy the same one the hospitals use.
Great pacifier. Stays clear of baby's nostrils for easy breathing and suction if needed. Cute patterns/styles, as well. Soft edges won't hurt baby's gums when teething.
bought this for my newest grandbaby ( momma ) he's now 4 months and he really enjoys his play time. he rolled over and discovered the mirror, such a precious smile came
i love the symphony pump, and this was much less than purchasing with the rental. i'm a nicu mom, 12 weeks pumping and not nursing- so this was the best pump out there.
medela labeled good quality bottles.  fits my medela advanced (pump in style).  great for storing milk as well in the refrigerator, have not tried freezing the bottles.
We've tried a number of pacifiers, and these are, by far, the best.  We really like that they glow in the dark, and thus can be easily found in the middle of the night.
I love these pacifiers! It made it easy to find them art night. I would recommend leaving them near a light source for awhile before they will glow longer and brighter.
love, love ,love. prefer over thirsties for sure. this cover is a little thicker due to the soft lining on the inside but i love that feature. velcro is awesome quality
this toy is super adorable....so gorgeous! looks like the characters....very pleased with the purchase!!!! xo<br /><br />i can't wait to give this to my 2 yr old niece!
you could buy the same gate for pets at a chain pet store at 3 time the cost... works the same, looks the same, so cheaper is always better! very happy with my purchase.
baby loves it.  too small for my toddler's helmet head, but perfect fr the nine month old.<br />my frost time buying this type of product and t was well worth the money.
overall, this charger has worked great. if you're like me, and need a large number of 9v batteries ready to go at a moments notice, you can't go wrong with this charger.
this thing is freakin awesome to maneuver and it was assembled within 25 minutes. i really liked the whole paris eiffel tower theme on this stroller. very unique design.
We tried several different pacifiers, but these are my babies' favorite ones. Light, not too big and have air flow. Much better than the rest of pacifiers on the market.
After trying some, I give this pacifier a try because it was orthodontic. Now my daughter only likes this one and never used again the others. I wish it comes with a cap
It didn't exist for my first child, what a shame! This is a great idea, well executed. My son has had this one and the lamb one for 16 months now and they're still fine!
The cow is adorable. My daughter does not take a pacifier, I was hoping she would use this one but she just chews on it. But I have nothing bad to say about the product.
One of the cutest pacifiers out there.  Have bought quite a few of the Wubbanub pacifiers and they are high quality, durable and everyone I have given one to loves them.
they are huge and cover to his pants. which is perfect cause he drop food in the high chair all the time. perfect and cute. a little pricey but very bright and colorful.
She took to it immediately and has been using it for about a month. There are similar products out in stores, but not this nipple. My daughter won't use any other pacis.
I love the blue pacifier because it is a different color than the one you get from the hospital. This is a great pacifier for a nursing baby. Also consider the WubbaNub!
My granddaughter loves this &#34;paci&#34; as she (8 mos.) can manipulate it, thereby keeping it handy at all times (mostly!) The legs and body of the bear do the trick!
LOVE THESE!  Can easily be sanitized without the nasty seems that other brands have.  The quality is fantastic!  I own about 20 of these...one for just about everywhere!
These are wonderful. Our child loves them and the attached stuffed animal helped them hold, control, and find the pacifier. We felt it helped with hand eye coordination.

MAM pacifiers are the only brand my daughter likes. These are super cute, the crystal plastic is a nice change, and if course, they are typical, high-quality MAM pacies.
Nice product, a good quality rubber. Too bad it didn't work for my kid, no matter how long I've tried to make him suck this pacifier. I need to try few more pacifiers...
Two out of three of my sons have taken to a pacifier when they were babies.  This is the only pacificer that either one of them would use.  Makes for a very happy momma!
These are my favorite pacifiers. I especially love these for night because they glow in the dark and are easy to find when you鈥檙e trying to put a upset baby back to bed.
it is lightweight, easy to fold and unfold, handy storage basket.....great stroller for nana & nana loves the tangerine. tired of fighting the fancy stroller i can never
These are my all time favorite pacifiers. I have had a harder time finding the glow in the dark ones in the store. Still I would keep looking before paying more than $7.
price is amazing, and so soft and comfortable - so much nicer than the cheap cotton one i got from a regular store. ordering another one! and buying in another size too!
Bought this for grandson. Had one just like it for my son when a baby and it was his fav thing as it is with my grandson. Very flexible and well made.  Highly recommend.
purchased this item to install on the corners of my outdoor grill. the edges are not rounded, so every year i have to buy a new cover. this will solve my yearly problem.
i love these cups. easy to clean, no extra parts and a perfect size. my son loves them too, especially the adjustable handles. great product, fisher price does it again!
Wubbanubs are a lifesaver!  Easy to find and we have never lost one in the year that we have been using them.  Would absolutely recommend to any baby that uses soothies!
Super cute! Seems to be well made. Bought it as a baby shower gift. It is a little smaller than I thought it would be, but then again, it needs to be small for babies :)
Comfortable, soft material with nice padding on the sides. Pretty design. Best of all the safety features with side impact give peace of mind. Excellent quality overall.
Perfect for a little boy! Similar to the Nuk pacifiers (6-18 month) usually used by him, so he took it with no problem. That made me really happy because it is so funny!
these are super soft and unnoticed. i'm a first time mom so breast feeding was a whole new ball game i love these definitely recommend hold up great in the wash machine.
The only pacifiers my little one will use...this was the brand given to her in the hospital.  Easy to disinfect and cheap enough to replace if they get lost.  Love them.
I have yet to find a pacifier that my baby doesn't get board with. It's light weight  and if it's not in her mouth then  it's right by her side. My 4 month old loves it.
Her favorite, gives her something to play with while she soothes. Highly recommend! Happy Baby, Happy mommy.<br />Easy to clean too. Throw in washer in an intimates bag.
I will be getting another one for my granddaughter. Her kitty chewed the nipple off the one I got her and she will not take anything esle. She loves to hold the giraffe.
excellent product / doesn't smell like plastic / great design / plant-based / baby loves / fyi: it's supposed to slightly cover babies nose to mimic the breast / 5 stars
Minha filha comprou para os bebes que vao nascer. Foi indicado por varias pessoas,inclusive aqui no proprio Amazon. Ela vai usar quando os bebes nascerem se for preciso.
These are the only pacifiers that our daughter's will use. These are similar to what we received at the hospital.  They hold up well and she refuses any other pacifiers.
I love the yellow! I was concerned they might be heavier like the blue ones but they are they are just like the green but yellow!  Im going to be ordering more of these!
Love this cow! So cute. My daughter loves it. Very soft and easy to find when my daughter drops it out of her mouth. Would recommend any of the WabbaNub line to everyone.
Order was filled quickly, shipping was reasonable, and we got a free sample pacie. All around a great experience. I would definately do business with this merchant again.
the lionheart seat saver does an excellent job in keeping your car upholstery like new.  i was able to get a tight fit by \\getting in\\ my child's seat while installing.
Our grandson started on this binkie while still in the NICU. The monkey's weight keeps it pretty much in place - and because of its size it hasn't been misplaced or lost.
I love this thing, more like my son loves this a lot he is always holding it and everything.  we do not regret getting this that's for sure id recommend this to everyone.
another great lamaze toy that i have hanging on my grandsons play mat that makes different noises and has different textures.  he likes to hear the crumpling sound of it.
i love this mobile! the music is great, the movement of the animals is great and it keeps baby entertained for quite a while! very easy to put together and great quality!
This fits just right in my newborns mouth. The suction on the nipple works great in my babies mount. This will help reduce overeating as well as crying. Clear and BP free
these work just as expected.  they cover outlets tightly but not so tight so you would need a screwdriver to pry them off. good for keeping little fingers out of sockets.
My newborn baby girl likes it too much. I have tried some other soothies. But all of those are harder compared to this one. This pacifier helps soothing a child to sleep.
Just like the other reviewer said, the shape of this product has helped with rashes around my daughter's mouth.  Not the prettiest pacifier out there, but very practical.
I bought these the first time when I had my oldest son and he loved it. He refused to take any other pacifier. I purchased them again for my second and he loves them too!
My granddaughter loves her WubbaNub!  So I always buy 2 for the baby showers I am invited to.  So far my favorites are the elephant, the lamb, and the Christmas reindeer.
my son is six and a half months and we also have the activity mat. he loves this one too. it is very portable and he loves the pattern and the little toys attached to it.
my grandson had colic really bad and screamed all night.  bought him this, and while they rocked him at night he listend to the little sheep.  well made, soft, very nice.
Wubbanubs are the only pacifiers that our son would take, and now they are a go-to gift for me with new parents.  My son sucked on the paci, the legs, the tag... Perfect.
Worth the money if your baby uses these pacifiers! Without the wubbanub, my baby would spit her paci out and I would have to chase it down, wash it off every few minutes!
used this my whole pregnancy and it worked wonderfully as i needed something for leverage. now it serves as my back support for my middle-of- the -night nursing feedings.
i am so glad i could still find these. my 7 month old son will only use this type of pacifier and we could not find them anywhere when i wanted to find some replacements.
i looooooooooove this stroller!!!! my son was so excited. very light and comfortable for him. perfect to go to the park, mall store even for travel. its the perfect size.
I had one of these for my 18 month old and she loved it. So upon the arrival of our new baby I just knew we had to have another one and now I can't leave home without it.
These hello kitty pacifiers are so adorable!!! I can't wait to have my little one use it in her ill mouth :) if she doesn't like them I can always keep it to look at heh.
My baby definitely prefers the Avent pacifiers.  We like these because they are so much easier to find at night in a dark room.  I just wish the glow lasted a bit longer.
Love It!! We also have the little lamb. My grand daughter is two months old and already she holds on to it. And it's a life saver because you can always keep track of it.
love these!!!  works great!!  no leaks. bought 8 for my 2.5 yr old and 4.5 yr old. they love them too. they don't even notice they are wet. which is great for night time!
got this as a gift for a 6 month old niece who's teething. she loves it and would put it in her mouth all the time. great deal, bought it based on rave reviews on amazon.
Cute, Fun, Well Designed, Highly Recommended, especially for fun photos, Fast Ship Love this Seller-<br />Great Price and makes a great present for anyone who has a baby.
My little boy love's his George, that's what we call his WubbaNub Monkey! Great product... Helps with keeping the pacifier in and the most important thing, not losing it!
the rug was for my grandson and fit just perfectly beside his crib. he is just learning to crawl and loves the bright colors. the rug arrived on time and without defects.
These are great. My kids were loosing there pacifiers at night while they were sleeping and screaming their heads off. These are much easier for them to find in the dark.
Very cute elephant. Our daughter loves the soothe pacifier and having the elephant on it makes it cuter and gives her something to hold. Plus it stays in her mouth better.
love these bibs. the snaps are great so no more velcro scratches. also, they are super absorbent so for the drooly-teething tots, they are perfect. great for feedings too.
Absolutely adore these pacifiers.  My daughter and her husband farm and of course have John Deere equipment.  This is great for either a boy or girl and just cute as ever.
love these diapers- they are great and fit well. patterns are perfect for a boy or girl. i prefer to use charcoal inserts in stead of the microfiber that comes with these.
my two toddlers had been getting into everything, so i bought these in hopes of saving my sanity. and they worked! easy to install, easy to use, and totally toddler proof.
perfect for chilly nights in the sf bay area. much softer than i expected. should work well for winter too as i'll dress him warmer before putting him in the sleeping bag.
The pacifiers themselves are great. But the 'colors may vary' concept caused us to end up with a girls set rather than a boy's set. But other than that these are great. :)
When my daughter was born these were the only pacifiers they used at the hospital and consequently the only ones she will use. They are wonderful and she loves using them.
If you want quality plush, Mary Meyer is the way to go. Their corporate offices are so helpful and the animals are top quality. I was thrilled to find this dog for my son.
These are the only only pacifiers my granddaughter likes!  They're most like the ones she was given in the hospital when she was born. If she loves them, I love them, too!
Our daughter will not go to sleep without it. I have bought three of them. This is because she pulls the pacifier off the elephant. Other than that, it is a great product.
my little one loves his pillow!  it is a perfect size and softness for him!  we even take it with us when we travel- it fits perfectly in his suitcase.  wonderful product!
You can't have too many of these. If your baby likes the Nuk shape, these are a great buy. We have them stashed in strategic places around the house and at grandma's, too.
This light and easily-folded model is ideal for quick outings and especially travel. Wonderful for airline trips when you're juggling a stroller, the baby, and diaper bag.
We like our diaper champ because you don't have to buy special bags and it let's you know when it's full.  We don't have any smell in our babies room, and she poops a lot.
These are hard to find and I was thrilled to get them! My daughter will only take this kind so when these came in the mail I was so happy! Great product and quick shipping
My house has a love hate relationship we these things. My kid loves them and I hate them. I really need to get rid of them cold turkey. Keeps the kid happy when he sleeps.
safe and easy to use; open, close and store. terrific to put in car and take the baby around without having to remove the car seat from the base.<br />a satisfied grandpa!
Have to buy another giraffe because my daughter can't sleep without it and we just lost it at the grocery store. Lesson learned and I'm buying 2 so we have one for back-up
Love these pacis! All 3 of my kids have loved these and took them the easiest at birth and beyond. The only disadvantage is that most pacifier clips don't work with these.
i cloth diaper my daughter so these bags are a must have! this one is my favorite by far. i love that the draw string allows me to close the top. great product all around!
the pillow seems just right for my girls.  my oldest is 3 and had another pillow that just went flat.  my youngest hasn't used a pillow yet,  but i think she will like it.
It works. There's not much more that I  can say about some goofy vampire teeth! I got a few great pics out of it, and a happy nephew, so consider it a purchase well spent!
These are the only pacifiers my baby will take & not spit out. They are great for smaller mouths & don't have the huge mouth shield that covers up their nose like some do.
I love this paci. Well, actually it's my baby who loves it and he only take this paci.<br />The only con is that it's hard to sterilize. Other then that it's good product.
i just bought a second wubbanub for my 12 month old son.  I bought the first one a year ago and the soothie is barely hanging on.  He loves walking around with the monkey.
Wubbanubs are great. Help keep the pacifier with the baby, if they spit the out or pull them out they tend to stay in the carrier and not roll and bounce out and get lost.
this is really a great umbrella stroller, i actually have two of them.  its so lite weight and easy to fold up and put in car.  and i love that it comes with a rain cover.
i bought these for a close friend, she said she was very happy with them. they were very useful and durable. i will ne buying some again for my nursing days in the future.
Stores around here do not carry this type of pacifier and my toddler won't use anything else.  I was down to my last one and then this package arrived and saved the day!!!
My sister-in-law thinks this is quite funny. They said that they intend to take pictures of their infant and send it to me, but from what I have heard they really love it.
begins to fit a child right around 17-18 lbs. still a little loose for our little guy but the size ones fit him still (16 lbs chunk) and look so slimming for a cloth cover
My daughter will only use this brand and style of binky. The glow in the dark is very useful when she drops it at night!! I believe these are the best pacifiers out there!
excellent product from avent. worth the money. it works perfectly for avent feeding bottles. fits most of the microwaves. its easy to use and would recommend this product.
Wubb goes everywhere with my daughter! The lamb doll is adorable and has enabled her to pick up her own pacifier and self soothe from the time she was a very small bundle.
These are the same pacifiers that our hospital was offering. Our baby girl uses them to fall asleep sometimes and she loves them. They were the perfect size for a newborn.
my granddaughter was so thrilled when she got this for christmas.  she is not a toddler but 13 and has always loved piglet.  this was one of her wish list items on amazon.
this was a christmas gift to my granddaughter & my daughter-in-law said she just loves it :) she even sent me a picture showing me how much fun she was having with them :)
This product is great. It's really nice that they glow in the dark. It makes it really easy to find they and put them back in your baby's mouth in the middle of the night.
works great at keeping my son from trashing the back of my seat in my new car. you can hardly notice its there since i have a black interior.<br />study and stays in place.
so cute and wonderful to buy for your child or as a gift. it arrived in time and well packed. when my sons is using it everyone comments on it and ask where to get it from.
These tethers are long enough to allow baby to play the attached toy but not too long to be dangerous.  Snaps securely on both ends.  I'm quite happy and would order again.
Fantastic product. We use this so much. I even hang it from her playmat. Great for not losing the pacifier during long car rides. This is my new go to for all baby showers.
we got these once my daughter got her teeth as she was biting the side of the crib and we didn't want her damaging the bed or eating paint! these work well and wash great!!
Such a simple concept well executed. It is one piece sewn together, i thought it was just going to be a clip on- but its great bc the whole thing can be thrown in the wash.
A must have for a fun baby shower! Can't say that the babies are into it, but I know my two year old nephew loves to walk around with this in his mouth and get some laughs!
Our son will use these until he's about 18mo.  We are happy with the quality - he chews on them sometimes, and they have held up well.  We also used the 0-6 and 6-12 sizes.
Perfect for babies that don't like silicone nipples.  I've had the paci for a month now and my child prefers to gum it down.  It better than nothing and it is still intact.
Swallow your pride and suck on it hard for about 1 minute. It will expand and you will have a contented baby and a better nights sleep. I cannot believe that's all it took!
Our 7 wk old daughter loves her Ella elephant- it is the only pacifier she will take! Ordered this bunny for her first easter basket (she will be about 14 wks). Super cute.
Bought these for my new little one and never once has he had any issues taking them.  They smell great and are a big hit.  I am BF and he has had no problems with latching.
Can't stop laughing. Such a cute idea. Great gift. My 15 month hasn't taken it out since I put it in an hour ago. So adorable. Lots of laughs on the afternoon walk today :)
These pacifiers are by far the best out there......I feel good about the material and my daughter loves them. These are the ones to buy....you will not be sorry you did so!
we use daily for feeding our 1 and 4 year old kids breakfast.  durable through a year of daily dishwasher cleaning.  green plastic part pops off but is easy to put back on.
Item was exactly what we were looking for.  My son loved it and my wife was happy as the different colors allowed her to color coordinate more outfits to pacifiers as well.
These are great! My daughter had skin irritations with the regular Paci's that covered her whole mouth, but these worked great for her and allowed the irritations to clear!
Bought this one for my niece. My daughter has the elephant one, and it's so cute. She'll hold onto the plush toy and try to get it back in her mouth after she spits it out.
this doll is great. it has been teaching our 1yr. old the parts of the body. if doll isn't being touched for about a minute it says \\i'm bored\\.<br />this is unnecessary.
The wubbanubs are cute and my granddaughter and great niece love them. With the animals attached to the pacifier, they are easy to find when they decide to throw them down.
This is cuter than it looks online and my nephew -- a newborn -- has already figured out how to put it in his mouth. I love these & I plan to give them as baby shower gifts.
i was totally pleased with my purchase, it came in a timely fashion, was exactly what i ordered and i thought it looked even better in real life then it had on the computer!
Super Cute Pacifier for Baby Girl 6 Months+!  These are just adorable and I consider them fashionable.  My baby girl enjoys these pacifiers, they're easy to breathe through!
super soft and does not pill!  our daughter will not sleep on &#34;regular&#34; sheets with out a fight now.  she loves to &#34;pet&#34; the sheets as she is falling asleep.
This is the only pacifier I will ever use. It's easy to find, the baby can hug it and does get spit out or pulled out as easily as others. Easy to wash and just hang to dry.

The product was purchased as a gift and the new Mom loved it.  She thought it was very clever. It was delivered in a timely fashion and there weren't any problems to report.
great storage set for the price i purchased two of them for double the storage and it worked out great !! it just makes my sons room look so much cuter and it holds a lot !!
Babe likes these a lot. Her first time using a Binky she took to these right away! My breasts are so grateful! I like that its BPA Free and has the extra holes for air flow.
my granddaughter loved it for her new arrival. he'll be sitting in it after a couple of months and mom will have no worries about germs going into his mouth or on his hands.
So cute and love the colors.  Can not wait for my baby girl to use this!  Wish I would have ordered the one for my son on Amazon instead of the 3 basic options they BRU has.
we bought this to protect our leather from the indentations of the car seat. it does seem disperse the weight well and when removing compression marks fade withing the hour.
Got one of these as a freebie when I was pregnant. Unfortunately, it was clear and got lost easily. These stand out awesomely no matter where it falls and my son loves them!
amazing!  our 4mo old is loving walks now.  we used the car seat but he was never really comfortable in it.  this has made a huge difference!  wish we had bought it earlier!
purchased to use along a sharp tile edge in my pool so the kids don't poke an eye out when being rough. works good for the purpose. i had to be creative to find something...
works flawlessly, and 100% necessary if you want to take your tot on walks before she is old enough to sit in the bob itself (outside of the graco seat). highly recommended.
The plush animal helps keep the pacifier from rolling away once the baby has let go of it (or spit it out).  We find these to be one of the best baby purchases we have made.
Keeps your pacifier clean and easy to find. Additional great attributes include the product being well-made, stylish, & functional. Love this product & love<br />This brand!
This is the only pacifier my daughter will take. We used to have the rounded version without the butterfly shaping and she didn't care for them. These seem more comfortable.
cute idea!  Mommy & Daddy-to-be were impressed with it and goes well the theme & d茅cor of baby's room! Fast delivery and in good shape-was here in plenty of time for shower!
These are some great pacifiers. Our daughter is teething.  These will last a week before showing signs of wear versus other brands that she has wore out in two days or less.
my mistake i thought this was a diaper its a cover...its great the designs are cute the buttons are really great they snap fine and stay closed my niece looked cute in this.
The MAM Air is a great product for little ones who tend to get skin rashes from saliva.  The mouth piece allows the skin to dry easier than the other pacifiers.  We love it!
my toddler daughter loves her new pillow.  she gets excited to go to bed when she sees her pillow in her crib.  this pillow fits perfect in the crib and for her little head.
These pacifiers are great. My son wouldn't take any other pacifier until I found these on the internet. They are reasonably priced and a really nice pacifier. He loves them.
Amazing!!!! Beautiful!!! Sparkly!!!! Look better than the actual picture!!!! Very happy and satisfied with the product!! I definitely recommend these butterflies to anyone!!
My baby loves these MAMs and even at 13 months old they are the only type and size she'll use.  We love that they glow in the dark and are so easy to find during night time.
i've purchased a few of these sets for family gifts, newborn gifts, and baby shower gifts.  everybody loved the zatswho.  it's a great gift, unique and certainly affordable!
the stars look great on the ceiling and they form constellations. It comes with a guide to the constellations as well as a story book . This is an awesome little nightlight.
Great value! These are so hard to find in our local stores, my daughter is super finicky when it comes to binkys. This brand is the only one she takes, other than her thumb!
quite reliable and easy to operate.  no problems so far.  i like the minimal set of features, without the lullabies/temperature b**l.  very nice it has wall mounting option.
It can fit two Philips Avent Soothie Pacifiers, stacked. Nice big handle with one open end to bend and fit easily around anything, purse handle, baby links, car seat handle.
the structure of this bottle is great in minimizing stomach issues:  colic, burping, reflux, etc., and we've tried lots (tommy tippee, avent, medela).  dr. brown knows best.
My daughter uses only these pacifiers, they're great. However when i bought it i wanted girl's colours, but i received boy's colours. I live in Brazil so i had to accept it.
The  Chomp  baby pacifier is hilarious! I sent it  to my daughter for my new grandbaby.<br /> She isn't here yet,but when she's old enough for it,  I'm sure gonna want pics!
so cute, my oldest daughter was a steelers fan, since she has passed 2 years ago and found out my daughter was expecting twin girls, just had to get these, she loved them :)
She had latched onto to these pacifiers quite well, however, not latched as in &#34;I need my paci&#34;. Once she's had her comfort, she spits it right out, which is a plus!
ove it...was easy to install and looks gorgeous on the landing of my stairway.........would recommend this company and will probably order again for another room in my house
shaped a little differently than most pacifiers, as it doesn't contour to the baby's cheeks, but that's perfect if you need to increase airflow and discourage teething rash.
My sister has triplets and they love this brand of pacifiers. It was nice to find a package of pink and purple gumdrops that was large enough to accommodate all three girls.
Daughter started on these and we can't buy enough! They are chained and tethered to everything we own! She won't take any other style and at this price, I can afford double!
The product is really neat, I saw it in an article and bought it for my child that is not born yet.  I think it will be a nice item for the baby if the baby takes a pacifier.
Love love love love.... Perfect condition. No complaints. Fast prime shipping. This is for 3 months and older. BPA FREE.. I cannot wait to give these as a gift. Gooooo BROWNS
worth the price and quite spacious. i can take it with me wherever i go and baby is not excluded because he can see through the mesh  sides.  really happy with this purchase.
we love this product, music is very soothing, know on the wood, baby sleeps quickly...very satisfied with this product since it is power plugable along with battery operation
Nice pacifier holder.  Very sturdy material.  My daughter never cared for pacifiers or I would have used it more... but for the time that it was used, I thought it was great.
these are probably my longest running sippy cups. they do not leak. they have an attached lid to cover the mouth piece which is great for travel. cute designs, easy to clean.
This is by far my sons favorite pacifier.  Even at 1 month he was able to keep a hold of it longer than the average pacifier. However, you can find it cheaper at Babies R Us.
These wipes have multiple uses.  These are safer to use when cleaning surfaces that come in contact with children's mouth (i.e., toys, pacifiers, and breast-pumping flanges).
All 3 of my kids each had their own longhorn Wubbanub.  They are great and are easier for your baby to hold and keep from falling on the ground. Perfect for any longhorn fan!
this product is great note 100 i loved this purchase and recommend everyone do not go up arepender the quaidade and spectacular.i loved that car here in brazil all appreciate
I got this for my 10 month old son. I wasn't sure if he would like it because this is not the brand of pacifier he normally uses but he loves it!! I plan on getting him more!
These have a much softer texture than your standard binkie and I like that they don't have a bunch of mysterious plastic ingredients. I do wish they would last longer though.
Our theme is monkey's so it's perfect that way and it's really cute but it also helps the baby keep the pacifier in and not just spit it out so my baby loves it and so do we.
My daughter has become a pacifier snob. She is not happy unless she has a Gumdrop pacifier. I have tried other pacifiers that I was given as gifts, but she won't accept them.
I got this item for a baby shower and I was not disappointed when it arrived. It made the perfect baby gift and I would recommend it for anyone with a baby or one on the way!
My son will only use soothie pacifiers, and he loves that this one has a monkey.  The plush toy makes the pacifier easier to keep an eye on when we are out, so I like it too.
It looks just as cute as in the picture. Haven't gotten to use it yet. Purchased for my daughter who is expecting a baby girl. I think they will both will be pleased with it.
we are very pleased with the set. the pillows could used a bit more stuffing but everything else looks great. the wall hangings were bigger than i thought and that is a plus.
This is Zac's new favorite &#34;chew toy,&#34; according to his mom.  He prefers chewing the foot rather than the pacifier, but that's okay if it is soothing a teething baby!
This is the cutest pacifier pet I ever seen my baby name is bella and I had to get her this it arrived very quick I was surprised very good size never lose a pacifier again:)
I was this and just had to get it.  I love the pink on it for my daughter.  I got a lot of laughs and cute pictures with this.  It seems to be comfortable for my daughter too
this little light works great. just enough light for our baby, but low enough not to keep anyone up. lasts several days, just in case you forget to plug it in, which is nice.
all the parts work perfectly with my medela pump-in-style.  the one piece shield/connector is even better than the 2 piece medela: one less part to clean, and better suction!
i've purchased this machine to blend fruit for my baby. it's saved me a lot of time since i no longer need to use the big blender. would definitely recommended this purchase.
my wife always tossed and turns. while pregnant she wouldn't travel with out this pillow. worth every penny. helped keep her on her side and helped her get some better sleep.
My nephew loves his long horn bull soother! He can cuddle it while he falls asleep. Fur is soft and the bull is a good shape. He's a nice weight and feels good in your hands.
these are so soft. they are so great for swaddling and cuddling. they are perfect as burp rags, staying cool in the summer, blocking the sun, as a blanky. i highly recommend.
I bought the Ella Bella Elephant and its just the cutest thing, everyone always comments on how cute it is, it also helps my baby girl keep it in her mouth without losing it.
product is of good quality, and washes up nice, and very soft. would reccomend this product to anyone wanting good quality crib sheets. very pleased with the whole experiance.
i would recommend this product to everyone. my son adapted very well to using the potty seat. much easier than the traditional potty trainer that tends to be a messy clean up.
My little guy LOVED these pacifiers! He wouldn't accept any other ones except for these. He's finally out grown them but I promise you I will be buying more for my next child!
i love this. it is a life saver. it helps to calm out daughter down every time. it never failed. i heard about the technique but when i realized there was a device i was sold.
we're very happy with this cup. my 8 month old dislikes all bottles and barely drinks from other sippy cups, but she drinks pretty well from this. easy to clean and very cute.
i just received this and it's precious! i don't know what i'm having yet and wanted an affordable option to bring baby home with if i have a girl. this fits my needs perfectly
i love these!  because really, wubbanubs and sophie the giraffe are waaaay to pricey to replace frequently. we haven't lost a nice toy yet in almost two years thanks to these!
If you're a breastfeeding mom - it's likely your baby will prefer these over the orthodontic kind. They hold up great and are easy to clean (follow manufacturer instructions).
Beautiful and perfect. My children use the Mam pacifier since they were born. Now they have 2 and a half years old and still use the pacifier wich are very safe and durable!!!
My new grandson loves these pacifiers! He could not keep a paci in his mouth until we got these, he holds onto the animal and it holds it in! Of course he is only 3 weeks old!
Bought these for my infant because I could not find these colors locally. She love them and used them until I broke her from them when she turned 10 months and had from teeth.
these were fantastic valences put i would of had to change rods and more holes in walls lol so i had to send back but they are prompt and exactly what they say they are thanks
I'm soo happy with the WubbaNub I got for my daughter! It's becoming the new &#34;it&#34; baby item everywhere, I had to jump on the band-wagon and get one for my newborn! :-)
Love these cute novelty pacifiers!! Unique styles and made well. 5 stars for this seller even though it took longer to get than I thought. I definetly will get more as needed!
The only pacifiers my baby will use.<br />Great message on them also.<br />I have about 15 of them now!<br />Here is another sentence to satisfy the word count for this review
Love this little pacifier giraffe! Got it for my grandson and it is one of the things that is always near him in the stroller or in his baby swing. So soft, colorful and cute!
My baby loves these pacifiers but I love the glow in the dark ones. Charge quickly,  charge lasts a long time and makes the pacifier easy to find in crib or bassinet at night.
My daughter loves these. the toy is plush and soft. I wash them in the Born Free sanitizer then hang dry. the toy helps keep the pacifier in place and makes it easier to find.
It is great.  Can't live without it.  You can only appreciate this if you have a child that loses his binky in the middle of the nite....easy to locate...happy, quiet child :)
i am pregnant right now and due is april 18. i bought this so that when baby is born he has a pillow already to use and not to have a flat head. i like it. its soft and comfy.
I got a few different Wubbanub characters for my nephew and the giraffe is his FAVORITE! its perfect for him to grab himself and he also enjoys chewing on the giraffes legs :)
My little man &#34;wakes up&#34; in the middle of the night. He's not really awake but my constant searching for his paci would end up waking him...this solves that problem!!!
Great delivery time and product was in perfect condition. This helps with keeping the binkey in my newborn's mouth or at least in close enough range to where he can get to it.
Avent products are the best: I like the product, I like the quality, and I like the company care and respect to its customers! Whenever possible I will always recommend Avent!
my 6 month old ate her first solid food with these spoons and had no issues eating the whole serving of food. she also liked to chew on the spoon and tried to hold it herself.
This pacifier may seem big and bulky to some, but it is the absolute best for baby's mouth and teeth and my son loves it.  I plan on buying the teething pacifier soon as well.
This brand is the best pacifier in the whole entire world.  My child loves them and they are easy to keep up with since the puppy makes it such a large item.  It is wonderful.
this arrived just as pictured and described. what a lovely gift for my first granddaughter. :) i would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a special gift for a new baby.
Cute reindeer.  Granddaughter loves all her Wubbanubs and will not only suck on the pacifer but she also chews on the stuffed animal. Just wish Wubbanubs weren't so expensive.
not only does look really cute on the little ones it seems to really soothe my son, sometimes!! i love it! it goes with everything he wears! i'll be getting the bracelet soon.
this was a great tool. of course its medela and they have just about perfected the paraphernalia needed by nursing moms. these were a great addition to the ones i already had.
these are so terribly cute. i have bought every single one that is for a boy or gender neutral, so he always has one to match his outfit. hope baby likes them as well as i do!
My baby loves her wubanub!  The little pink bear helps keep the pacifier in place, and she can hold on to it, even though she's only 2 months old.  Also makes for cute photos.
i bought this because my 1 year old needed something before just being in the regular tub. this item is fantastic !<br />holds air and is very comfortable. he sits well in it.
This little thing spared my sanity. My 13 month old has used a variety of wubbanubs throughout the past year. They have some kind of magical soothing quality. Buy one. Or six.
My 4 month old loves her Wubbanub and this one is just too adorable! If it's not in her mouth, she's cuddling with it or playing with it. Definitely one of our best purchases.
With the glow in the dark pacifiers my daughter can now find her pacifier in the dark and put it back in her mouth so I don鈥檛 have to get out of bed an help. It鈥檚 wonderful!!!
this is a great product, our 6 mth old loves it. the tray snaps on securely and removes easily. clean up is a one wipe job and its deep enough that spillage stays in the tray!
I never thought it would be so useful to have a glowing pacifier, but believe me you will need it when your baby wakes up crying and you can麓t find your pacifier in the dark :)
We bought this as a gift for a baby shower, then had to go out and get it for ourselves. We love it! It is easy to clean, easy to carry, and looks fabulous. Highly recommended!
We were given these for our preemie in the hospital  and have been using it ever since. He's sort of grown out of having a pacifier, but we still keep them around just in case.
There really is no difference between these and any other pacifiers just the look.  But beings that my wife is a Packers fan it sure is fun having the Cowboys pacifiers around.
This is such a cute desing.  My baby boy loves this pacifier and used it since he was born.  It was the first object that he started grabing and keept him busy in the car seat.
A erect combination of pacifier and soft cuddly toy. The lamb's leg is great for holding in the mouth so to free up the hands for crawling. Holds up great for regular washings.
It has that uneven shaped nipple with a flat part on it. Baby is picky about which pacifiers he will use, but he liked this one. And looked adorable in it. Signed, big brother.
Bought this for my grand daughter who is three months old.  Works great.  She can hold the monkey and the pacifer<br />stays in her mouth.  Monkey is nice and soft.  Life saver
These are amazing and my babies favorite. I had some similar that had no loop to hook to her but these are so easy to find a paci attachment for and so soft for her to suck on.
These pacifier are the bees knees! My son loves them AND they do not leave indention's around his mouth like EVERY other hard plastic pacifier does. Will not buy anything else.
We have three wubbanubs: the monkey, dino, and the puppy. The shape of the puppy is great. It's legs are just the right size for my four month old to grab. Plus, it's precious!
Son loves these!  The pacifier is sort of cheaply attached to the doll portion, but you could always sew it back on when it falls off like my mother had to do for her grandson!
If you look at your hospital soothie and go to the website, it redirects to Philips, and this is the same product.  Less time hunting on the floor or between cushions (for now)
They are soft and comfortable. i like that the shape is designed to create a comfort fit around baby's mouth.  My newborn loves them and amazon has multi pack at a great price.
the rattle is admittedly small, but adorable.  it's held up remarkably well in the few months that scarlett's been gnawing on it.  i would buy another for a baby shower basket.
These are great and we love the 49ers out daughter loves them and the sports ones are the only ones she will use she will not even touch other brands even though we have tried.
My nephew who is 6months loves this pacifier. I brought him a monkey one and he loved it, so I had to get him another one. He wont leave home without it!! Well worth the price!
my grandbaby loves her chair.  she is truly a tv lover, opting for such deep and moving films as cloudy with a chance of meatballs.  any kid - 3 years old will love this chair.
so cute, well built. my daughter loves it. Soft, bright colours, The pacifier is also very soft not what I expected and my duaghter has no confusion between pacifier and breast
I love these! The nipple part is the same size as the 0-3mo pacifiers, but these ones are a lot thicker around the base and also the nipple is a lot tougher for their teething.
its cute! its not exactly the same color as shown in the picture its a little darker for some reason it looks lavender to me on the picture but its actually very pink and cute!
I love Wubbanub pacifiers now! My daughter learned how to hold them by two months of age and loves snuggling with them. I especially love that it holds the pacifier up as well.
I love it for my daughter. She gets to cuddle the monkey while sucking on her binkie. It also helps when ever it drops it doesn't always land on the nipple side and gets dirty.
sheet is exactly what my daughter needed putting the baby to bed. the sheet is cozy and warmer when she lays him down and not the shocking cotton sheet which would wake him up.
I LOVE these pacifiers and are the only ones my son will take! Exactly the same as the hospital gives! Cute colors. Expected by delivery date! Definitely happy with the service.
The attached toy helps keep the pacifier in the babies mouth, it also gives something for the LO to play with or hold. To clean, stick them in the washer and then sanitize them.

what a cute teether....it is pretty large though.  very colorful and cheerful!!!  my grandbaby really likes it and i love the color.  great buy.  you will not be disappointed!!!
this is an great product. it was comfortable and easy to use and allowed me to pump at work while still getting things done on my computer. a must have for working/nursing moms!
this is the only paci that my baby will take and actually keep.  for some reason he really likes the soothie.  this is a great product and it makes such a cute baby shower gift.
Bought for my sister an she absolutely adores it! Says all of it will fit her needs perfectly! Excellent present.. An if I lived closer to her I am sure I would love it as well!
i was a little hesitant on ordering after reading that others didn't receive authentic medela adaptors. ordered it anyway. real medela part. works great, happy with replacement.
good product, it's quite simple to use and not much to say about it as there is no real space for anthing to go wrong really. if you have dr brown bottles then this works great.
my son is three and i've been looking around for a toddler pillow. this comes with a pillow and pillow case great for a starter bed set. the pillow is very comfortable yet firm.
Recently purchased this for a friend's new baby.  He is three weeks old and previously wouldn't take a pacifier.  She gave him this and he contently kept it in for over an hour!
this is a really good cover for the price. would recommend this on an older baby. hook and loop has remained sticky for five months and there have been no leaks with this cover.
I bought my daughter other brand pacifiers with fancy color and designs. However she loves this one the most.  I believe it has to do with the texture and design. Easy to clean.
These are soooo adorable. I got it for a baby shower gift, but have used several myself. Any baby I have had loves them. Quality is great and it is the Original Soothe pacifier.
My son's daycare turned us on to these pacifiers--they are the best! He started using them when he was 4.5 months old. They stay in much better than soothies, and he loves them!
works great. i was also impressed with the pen. i love the way it writes. the cap snaps on and stays on tight. if your reading this because your researching stylus buy this now!
exactly what i was looking for - not available in stores as a simply, \\snoogle\\ cover. it has to have the leachco name on it - not available at target near me or babies 'r' us.
fit is true to size, good quality, reflects the good experiences we've had with this brand of sleepsacks in smaller sizes. zipper works well, fabric washes easily without fading.
This is one of my twin's favorite pacifiers.  I'm not sure if its the darker colored nipple or something else but we've tried a handful of others and this is always his favorite.
really worth the price.looks good and it's secure.my child loves it too.i really suggest you should get this kind instead of spending more money on stuff where kids grow everyday
this is a great sun shade - and it is really needed for this stroller to keep the sun off the toddler riding in the back. good for keeping the kids dry in light rain showers too.
i love these packets! they are so easy to use and i love that i can throw them in the dishwasher and the freezer. they make baby-food pur茅e storing a breeze! i want to buy more!!
We ordered this for our son's first birthday party coming up and it's so funny!  He likes pacifiers and this one isn't too different in feel from the one's he has, so he uses it.
My husband bought this for our 3 month old son, and he adores it! He even smiles when he sees it! I highly recommend the WubbaNub! I think we'll get the turtle and elephant next!
i ordered this for my grandsons birthday and i had days to spare. it made it on time. the set is great because of the sippy cup. i haven't found a set with all the needed pieces.
I love these to quick clean my pump parts between pumping at work. Cheaper than the medula wipes. I just wipe them and keep them in the cooler until I'm done pumping for the day.
i ordered this the other day and so far so good. the only thing i strongly dislike about this item is how hard it is to out together when you're alone.  worst 4 hours of my life.
This was the only pacifier my son would take.  And I like it because it is rubber and he just chews all over it now and I don't have to worry about hard plastic hurting his gums.
Cute binky.<br /><br />However, my baby doesn't like this type of nipple. He always rejects this. Not taking off any stars because of that. All in all this binky/pacifier is cute
My baby transitioned from the newborn pacifier to these without any issues.  She was fine with the size 2 or size 3 but I guess it depends on you kid.  Mine was fine with either.
My son loves Dr. Browns binkeys and they said its good for 12 months plus.  My son is 18 months.  I know I should ween him off but he teethes so bad that I just cant take it away
My son and i both prefer these pacifiers to others we have tried because my son likes shorter styles of pacifiers and i like them as they do create less gas for baby when sucking
do not ask me why the medium size comes with the pump.  i do not have large nipples, but pumping is much more comfortable with the large.  also, my production went up with these.
I bought this for my nephew and got a whole outfit for him on amazon because my mom is a big Orioles fan and she loved dressing him each time she had him before he outgrew it lol
our six month old is always trying to get at our remotes.  we finally got her this one and it has become her new favorite toy.  lots of sounds and lights! hours of entertainment.
These are the easies to clean and best shaped pacifiers out there.  Both of my girls only took these pacifiers and I trusted them and the product.  You can't go wrong with these!
this was delivered faster than i expected. the cover is exactly what you see and i love it. it has all the regular things a baby book should. even space to write up till month 12
We did not think we would be able to find these. Our new baby feel in love with the hospital pacifier. He loves them and they are much more durable and less expensive than others.
met every expectation i had. baby loves it mommy and daddy love it can't beat it. only problem not made for extra tall babies.  our baby will probably fit in it for 3 months or so
fisher-price products are always quality assurance. how could it be different, this purchase was exactly what you were looking for my baby. now is enjoying to replace the battery!
great pacifier for our baby to soothe baby. no other pacifier work as great as this one for us.  She can played with the stuffed animal as well. wish i had this for my first baby.
I thought the pacifier part would not be appealing since, my daughter hates every pacifier. She loves it! She snuggles with the frog at night even if she is not using the pacifier
CUTE FUN AND GOT LOTS OF AWWWs at the BABY SHOWER. I put pink bows around froggie's neck and made it perfect for a little girl baby who's mom decorated her room in green and pink!
Super fast shipping great product.  Excellent seller I needed this for a baby shower and the seller got it to me super fast!  Would definitely recommend and buy again.  Thank you!
it all works. we can see her, hear her, and carry this to other rooms. check check check. worth the peace of mind, and a little higher quality to hopefully last more than one kid.
i have many brands in my stash and this has been our favorite for the past 17 months. as other brands have failed i will replace with the easy fit to keep up my stash for baby #2.
It was just what I wanted. The baby likes it better than others. I ordered more than one the company sent them separate. They should try to combine all purchases into one shipment
Our daughter loves these pacifiers, however, just make sure when purchasing you realize Amazon chooses the color for you. We were not disappointed, we received 2 purple pacifiers.
My baby loves this particular brand, I'm not sure why maybe because they fit better orally in his mouth then other cheap brands. Like that they are backed by the Orthodontal docs!
this item was purchased as a gift. we were told by the parents that the baby likes it and is convenient for both the parents and the baby. it arrived quickly and was as described.
product has worked as promised.  the baby,  who has chewed through several pacifiers in the past, has not bitten through this.  he's had it a month.  and it's still in good shape.
The stuffie is wonderfully made And my sweet girl looks adorable with it and genuinely seems to like it! I recommend it and am ordering a second these rock!!! :) Very happy momma!
great waterproof bib. the scrunch collar to prevent dribbles is brilliant! the bib is soft and machine washable with micro-fiber terry cloth front and a waterproof polyester back.
this is a life saver.  our baby loves it and has gotten tons of entertainment.  great for rides in the car or while at restaurants.  keeps baby entertained.  wonderful investment.
i could not live without this! keeps diapers and wipes neat inside the diaper bag and is easy to grab while on the go. i love the print on the inside and it is very easy to clean.
We LOVE Wubbanub's this is a cute holiday one that can be use year round. They keep the paci in the babies mouth and give them something to hold ob to. Best baby shower gift ever!
The best pacifiers ever! They are rounded away from the face so you don't get a ring around the mouth mark like most traditional pacifiers.  This is the only one my son likes now!
Bear was adorable and my 3 week old grand daughter was very interested in it . Seem to give her comfort. I would tell all mothers to purchase one for their baby.  Love that bear .
this walker is light weight and folds down easily for storage.  it was perfect for my grandson who wasn't quite sitting up yet. provided back   support and is entertaining to him.
I am breastfeeding my daughter and it seemed like she hated every bottle I tried to give to her. except this one. I noticed this one she doesnt burp or spit up as bad. I love them
My baby is very picky with pacifiers. If you buy these in the store for a 2pack its about five dollars. Its worth it to a big pack and if you lose one then you know you have more!
this holds more than it looks! i had a skip hop of similar shape but because of the design it held much too little for the needs of a newborn! this is beautiful and well designed!
This was the only binky my baby would use. I have no idea why he loved it so much but I tried several others and he rejected them all. The only bad thing is they are hard to find.
Will be getting more of these! My little girl loves them! We have tried other types of pacifiers with her and these are the best one for us and her! Love the variety of them also.
These are so cute! We were so excited to find cute pacifiers in my daughters favorite brand. My girls each had a variety of Hello Kitty in their stockings for Christmas this year.
i thought it was great they did just what they said  . it arrived just when they said it would and my grandson loves it! so does his mommy. thank you. will difinately order again.
works great!  easy to travel with our baby.  infinitely adjustable to anyone in the family!!  we got grey and the color is exactly like the picture.  very happy with this purchase.
A welcome invention. I'm taking care of my new baby Granddaughter and loving every minute. Didn't have these when raising my children and always looking for the pacifier. Wonderful
My daughter loves feeling the monkey while she sucks and falls asleep. I had to change out the pacifier because she doesn't like the soothies. She prefers the orthodontic pacifiers
this cloth diaper is very soft to the touch ,comfortable and cost efficient. i recommend this pocket diaper to anyone wanting to add another cute design to their cloth diaper stash
very mobile. can bring to a restaurant. so far, it has strapped onto most chairs. also, love the reclining feature so baby can drink his milk without struggling to lift the bottle.
we love this car seat- and we use the chicco liteway plus stroller with it (which we now use as an umbrella stroller without the infant seat adapter).  very pleased with this item.
became my daughters favorite toy/teether. she could hold onto it by herself and she loved the texture. it helped that her first pacifier was also the same flavor from the hospital.
My dolly could not live without her wubbanub! We have a few designs and this is a favorite of hers. She loves to rub the tail as an additional comfort. OH, and it's super cute too!
I love this little pacifier bag! Keeps extra binkies handy and CLEAN! What a relief when you have your hands full and a crying baby to have the binky right there! Highly recommend!
Its cute its adorable and would recommend it for any one with infants.. :)  I bought it for my daughter because  she wanted it for my preemie grandson.. It is a huge hit in he NICU
If you haven't tried a Wubbanub for an infant or toddler who likes or needs a pacifier, you are missing out.  They are cute, durable, easy to hold, and keep the paci close at hand.
My daughter can not live without this pacifier.  She loves feeling the softness of the animal and she's able to keep it in her mouth with the help of the furry animal.  Love, love!
This was too big and clunky for sleeping with, but he loved it when he was awake. It was fun for him to play with and use as a teether in addition to sucking on it like a pacifier.
my baby loves this thing.  It actually helped her learn how to grab things better and it was easier to stick in her mouth when I was in the car at a stop light and she was whining.
My baby loves this pacifier.<br />She refuses all other brands.<br />They have different colors so I know which one I have washed recently and I switch them out on a regular basis.
there was mix up in my order they were very helpful in getting my order to me. i am sending these to my grandchildren . they are really cute and i'm sure they will be used  a lot !
My son's teeth were changing as a result of chewing on his regular (big) pacifier.  Started using the Mam with the smaller neck and his teeth and bite are normalizing.  Thanks Mam!
I ordered this mattress to go in a portable crib that I purchased from a daycare.  It has a snug fit, as it should, and seems very comfortable.  I am very happy with this purchase!
This wubbanub is great for helping my son keep it in his mouth. It isn't far if he spits it out and he can push it back in. Plus he likes to play with it to! Bought at 3 month old.
i love, love love these wubbanubs. not only are the super cute, but they work pretty good at helping baby keep pacifier in mouth, plus it also gives baby a soft texture to explore.
any a+a blanket is my favorite! our daughter has several of the dream (4 layers of muslin) blankets. they're perfect for tummy time and we also use it for her to lay on in general.
I use these to clean parts between pumping at work and they work great.  Essential item for pumping bag.  I wouldn't use regular wipes but since these are food grade they are safe.
These are amazing - newborn has loved them since she started using them. They definitely sooth her. Now we are buying the rest of the sizes for the months to come. Great purchase !
My son (14 mo) is ADDICTED to his pacifier. When Wal-M@#t no longer carried these in stock, i panicked!! So glad i could find these on Amazon. These are the only ones he will use!!
these are great! we used them as when she was an infant for burp cloths/ clean up cloths. now that she's  older they are the best for starting baby food because they cover so much!
we used and loved aden + anais blankets with our first daughter & ordered this blanket when we found out we were having a second little girl. very soft and warm. beautiful pattern.
it's great for kids who are slightly afraid of the dark. it's a great amount of light and it goes off after 30 min or so by then the kids are asleep, so it doesn't waste batteries.
just what we had hoped for, speedy delivery great quality highly recommend this product washes great in front load washer easy for baby to hold and not so easily lost when tossed!!!
This is simply the best pacifier we have been able to find. It is made of high quality rubber and our daughter loves it. It seems like it will last a long time. It is made in Italy.
Love this pacifier, and so does my baby. Next time though, I won't buy the transparent one, in the middle of the night it can be very hard to find. The colorful ones stick out more.
These are the only pacifiers that my breast-fed little one will use!  Easy to clean and the little handle on the front is perfect for attaching a binky clip or for his little hands.
this is perfect for what we needed. we put it on top of a dresser to create a changing table. it is a great size and the sides make it feel more secure while i am changing the baby.
I purchased this for a friend who still breastfeeds her baby. It worked wonderfully. She is able to still breastfeed while occasionally bottle feeding. The baby likes these bottles.
I used these with my first baby and they were the only ones she'd take. I bought the orange ones for my second baby and they are adorable, even though my second baby isn't here yet.
This is a Great gift for a new baby. Our grand daughters had several &#34;Wubby's&#34; and loved them til they wore out! They are much easier to keep track of than a plain pacifier!
They are the only pacifiers my daughter will take.  She is exclusively breast feed so we had a hard time finding one she would use. We tried 3 different brands before finding these.
Product is a bigger version of the 0-6 months pacifier i liked those pacifiers so i bought the 6 - 18 month pacifier and the baby is happy can't ask more than that!  more than that!
Unfortunately, my son refuses any and all pacis. We have bought several brands and this just happened to be one we tried. He hates them, but I am sure these are great pacis though..
These are perfect for our diaper bag! And they dont bother the baby at all. Im sure you moms know how often a pacifier gets dropped, so it is kind of neccesaary while out and abouy.
a great owl to add to my toddler's growing collection.  this guy is quite large, too!  we call him &#34;big owl.&#34; not really good for cuddling up with, but he's a keeper anyway.
my newborn is very picky , he loves this pacifier a lot. and it is durable, looks a bit weird when baby latching on it. but it is sturdy construction is safe and make me worry free.
favorite bottle brush cleans really well without scratching!!! dr browns bottles require some deep cleaning but this makes it much easier and it's worth it i swear by these bottles.
I have 10 month old twin boys and I got these when they were 2 months.  The plush toy makes it easy for the baby to find and put into his mouth.  It also keeps us from losing pacy's
My son is not a big fan of pacifiers, and was not loving the Avent 0-6 mo one, but this one was a hit! It has an intresting shape, I want to believe it's safe for the growing teeth.
This is our second Wubbanub. My son loves them. I do  wish you could somehow detach the pacifier to wash the animal, but they're affordable enough that I don't mind  replacing them.
these were the only bottles our breastfed daughter would use when i went back to work at 12 weeks.  i purchased them on recommendation of our daycare and have not been disappointed.
These pacifiers are the best on the market! Especially when you're trying to find it in the dark, or making sure it's still in your baby's mouth while out walking around after dark.
i own 3 of these seats , 2 for my wife and i and a spare for the grandparents. highly recommend this seat for you parents looking for comfort,safety,reliability and ease of install.
i started making homemade food for my little home.this is great for food that has been cook and needs to be mashed or fresh foods like bananas and avocados. easy to wash and sturdy.
my daughter loves this toy, when she starts to get bored of it i just spin it around and she is amazed again.  this thing is by far her favorite.  so much going on, on this one toy!
started using this kind of pacifier after the hospital gave us one. baby gives it 2 thumbs up. still using this (not 3 months + one) at 5 months. will replace at first sign of wear.
If you have a baby or toddler they will absolutely fall in love with these. You will too. We love the monkey-binky and my son can't sleep without it. This is our third wubbanub too.
There's a nice smooth cool side for hot days and a soft fleece side for warmer days. Nicely sized for hugging (not to cover baby) and teething corners make this blankey a recommend!
i love these cups. they stay clean, don't absorb odors, and keep the temperature of the liquid inside for hours. perfect for hot summers and cold winters, like we have in cleveland.
Love the open space in the pacifier.  The space is less plastic to keep germs and more breathing room.  High quality, but hard to find in stores.  Love Amazon for that reason alone.
My little ones LOVES these pacifiers.  She's tried more conventional ones, but these seem easier to keep in & more comfortable for her.  I will be buying many replacements of these!
Got this for my new baby grandson Keaton. He will be born on 1-16-12 and I gave it to his parents for Christmas. They were so excited and I know he will love his little monkey paci.
i like this toothbrush because it's safe, gets the job done, doesn't pose a danger to the child, and starts to teach the routine of brushing your teeth before bed and in the morning.
I live in Brazil and here it is difficult to find this product. Everywhere I go with my son using a pacifier, all love!<br />Besides beautiful, it is still very safe and comfortable.
Fun for baby to hold, colorful, holds in place on our newborn's chest when our arms wear out from replacing it over and over...now we gift these to all our friends with newborns too!
Great deal and so nice to have back up smoothie ! Cause in this house I have a smoothie monster always taking and never giving them back sobthis packed has been working out for us ;D
I bought 4 kinds of pacifiers.  This is the ONLY one that stays in my 2 month old baby boy's mouth.  He loves it.  I'm throwing all the other ones out.  They just don't work for him.
got this for my 1 year to transition into.  it was really easy to put together and is pretty wood. no complaints. my 5 year old jumps on it and it seems to be holding up pretty well.
Our baby girl (now 2) loved her caterpillar wubbanub and it made it easier for her to find and hold her pacifier at a young age. Recently purchased Ella the Elephant for our newborn.
I love how these pacifiers glow in the dark. My baby isn't huge into pacifiers, so it wasn't a huge help, but at least she was able to get it at night in her crib without a light on.
We bought this Wubbanub as a backup to another Dino Wubbie. It is the only pacifier that our baby looks for! He is definitely attached and Mama loves that it doesn't get lost easily!
BPA free plastics and nice shape for the development of your child's mouth. Highly suggest you get an 8 pack so you always have one around for a teething kid! Good luck and carry on!
My little guy is not here yet, he is due in Aug.. But I caint wait to use them then! they are super cute! And I have read a lot of good reviews about them that's why I bought them :)
what an excellent unit for the price. clear picture in low light situations and you can easily switch between camera and talk to your baby through it if you want. highly recommended.
These pacifiers are soo cool.  I have triplets, so I've gotten over 8 of them! They are soft, you can throw it in the washer and let it air dry!  People love them! they are too cute!
Best binkies ever. I even bought the pink for my son who uses them when sleeping because I couldn't find the blue. I wish they weren't discontinued. The only binkies my son will use.
Brought these for my infant because the cheap pacifiers keep saliva and mess inside now. Hate it! I went back to soothies because they are much cleaner then the regular $1 pacifiers.
I LOVE THESE PACIFIERS ( OKAY MY BABY LOVES THEM ) SO MUCH WE HAVE BOUGHT THEM SINCE OUR BABY WAS A NEWBORN. WE HAVE USED ALL SIZES AND OUR SON STILL USES THEM. FANTASTIC PRODUCT!!!!
This bear is so cute !!!  This is a fantastic product and I would recommend for babies!  My granddaughter thoroughly enjoys this WubbaNub and is the only kind of paci she will take !
This thing is a lifesaver. My son can find his pacifier anytime he wants cause when i put the plush toy on his chest, the pacifier is always within his reach. We can all sleep sound.
A MUST HAVE!!! The WubbaNub held my son's pacifier in (or close enough he could reach it) through the night! Eliminates that constant searching through the bed trying to find a paci!
My baby loves these.  He was using the newborn size, but I thought since he was getting bigger, I wanted one that fit his mouth.  Very happy with these and would recommend to anyone.
My Grandson was born just a couple days ago and has to be kept in the NICU.  It is very conforming to me that soon as they turn on his dexbaby bear he settles down and looks relaxed.
This pacifier was the best part of my son's Halloween costume. We got so many compliments on it. It is so much easier than putting a baby in a goofy costume they don't want to be in.
Just to clarify, there is no SIZE difference in these compared to the newborn to 3 month ones, but they are THICKER, giving the baby something more substantial against budding teeth.
great product. exactley what i wanted and recieved them early in the mail.my daughter loves this binkie and its hard to find the original product because playtex changed the product.
outstanding! the stroller is super smooth and life's with no effort. the only thing missing is a safety lanyard to keep it from getting away....a 10 dollar fix i took care of myself.
love this hands free bra! i started out using a medela hands free bra, but after a couple washes, the medela bra lost its elasticity and wasn't supportive enough.  this bra is great!
love this product. i got the baby buller as a gift but u love using this instead for some of her food. i stopped buying jarred baby food a d this makes it easier to make food at home.
Once our son started jamming the newborn sized MAM shield sideways in his mouth and getting it stuck, we moved up to the 6+ month size. These are great and very easy for him to grasp.
this item does a great job! we live in the sonoran desert, and being doggone hot to pleasant, we do not anticipate the problems other folks in colder climates have had with this item.
you only really need one of these, highly recommend to keep your hands cool when handling these. take the bottle out of the warmer, wipe the excess water off and pop it in the sleeve.
We got one like this in the hospital when our baby was born.  It is nice to have a simple one piece pacifier.  It is very easy to clean and withstood being boiled.  The baby loves it.
what can i say - it's a boob sucker!  it does what it's supposed to do.  i like these all-in-one designs over the medela personal fit ones where you have to buy each piece separately.
Love these their so cute & from these guys a lot cheaper then my local stores I can buy it from , I have absolutely no complaints at all , and have ordered several times here for gift
The picture doesn't do it justice. This is the cutest!  It has flowers on the belly. These are the best pacifiers because they stay in their mouth. These are a must have for new moms.
My baby LOVES his wubbie. Mild panic sets in if we are away from home and without wubbie. I initially thought the price of this was ridiculous, but now give huge kudos to its creator.
These seem to be the best size and shape preference for my little girl. Every other pacifier we tried, she would dismiss. I recommend the glow in the dark ones for bedtime. Lifesaver.
This is the best invention of the 21st Century: glow in the dark pacifiers. No more looking everywhere in the crib for it at 2am. I can see it from across the room. Such a smart idea!
My grand-babies love these, and I like the fact that they come in a case for storage. The case is also used for sterilizing the pacifiers in the microwave.Nice! I recommend this item.
What can I say my daughter after coming from the hospital just fell in love with this style of pacifier and doesn't want anything else. Shipping was quick and the price was excellent!
we just transferred our 4 month old out of our room and into the crib.  the baby is comfortable and sleeps many hours through the night.  this mattress fit in our ikea crib perfectly.
love these! so much more absorbent than other brands i have tried.  they are also relatively comfortable.  i wear them all day and even through the night and only have to change once.
this is a great towel set for your baby. the material is perfect for after bath time. the towel is a good size and quality is durable so i know it will last through the toddler years.
perfect for my 20 month old, who is approx 26 lbs. warm and comfortable for my little guy. great purchase for parents who do not want to use loose blankets in their little one's crib.
My son loves these pacifiers. I tried other brands but he wouldn't use them. These are cute, functional and liked by baby. I also got the MAM leash and nipple cover for it, I love it!
the dog gate works great for me, i have a little mop for a puppy with hardwood floors, so he sides around alot when playing, the gate is a life saver, so he don't fall down the stairs
My granddaughter loves this baby but it was a little smaller than what she had hoped for.  We kept it because we thought of it as a premature baby.  It is still loved and played with.
I give Wubbanub's as gifts to people with new babies for very good reason. New born's won;t use them, but after about the 2nd month, the parents realise why I gave them this thing :-)
Baby didn't use a pacifier until he started teething, and these work perfectly as a teething tool.  They are chewy and flexible, and have no hard plastic or weird odors.  We love them!
always a good idea. i use them for straps on our teeter totter (they don't have safety straps and they should). portable and can be used for many purposes. not just for shopping carts.
i love it, my baby loves it, talk about having a conversation starter. if you are looking at this, get one now. in fact, i am ordering more do give to my friends as a stocking stuffer.
our 2 month old loves this thing! her favorite sound is the rainforest. she doesn't love the other music yet. she loves following the animals and coos to them. great developmental toy.
i am in love with this bedding system. i have had it for almost a year now and i'm still really impressed with the quality and its effectiveness. great ventilation for my little one :)
LOVE Wubbanubs- Perfect for keeping passy from rolling all over or under the couch or bed, stays put when falls out of baby's mouth and easy to find if dropped. Also serves as a lovey.
My baby loves this. We used to have problems with her paci falling to the floor all the time.  Now it rarely happens.  She spits it out and just stays on her chest.  And it is so cute.
Got this for my 4 month old son, he loves pacis, and I love monkeys for him. This was perfect. I do suggest washing it before using because it was a bit dusty. Which is understandable.
We started with Medela bottles, then Tommy Tippee and finally got a free MAM from our OB. The nipple shape is very easy for my son to latch on to, and they seem to help a bit with gas.
i ordered this along with other items on my daughter!s baby registry.  it does just what it says, it soothes, great product and comes two in a package, just in case one gets misplaced!
I tryed all binkies out there and this is the one she and I both liked. Its no weird shaped and she likes it. She is solely brestfed and wont take anything silcone and she loves these!
Although it doesn't close when dropped (it closes after being dropped face down or if dropped on the side the nipple is safe) but atleast beats the hassle of carrying the cover around.
i love this pillow! it's a comfortable size and it doesn't flatten out with use. it provides good support... my low back has felt much better since i started sleeping with this pillow.
this chicco dj baby walker, splash is a very well made product!!<br /><br />my grand daughter loves to walk in it for hours!!<br /><br />for the price i recommend this product highly!!
the skirt is really cute in person, and a great deal for the price. the hot pink is definitely a bright pink color (not quite as muted as the picture) which is what we were hoping for.
my son loves this potty seat and he potty trained fast using this seat and the elmos potty time video. easy to clean and use and the white toilet seat part fits into a big toilet too !
that was the only one pacyfier for my douther, she didn't use any difrent because their felt from her mouth she used the one from 0-6 months, so i keep going with that one<br />love it
I'm so glad to find something natural- I don't know if the baby will actually like pacifiers.  My first didn't, but that has nothing to do with this product.  Please keep making these!
our 5-month old loves to hold this and, of course, put it in his mouth. he even snuggles with it!<br />plus, it's safe to put in the washer and dryer, which makes cleaning it a breeze!
just got this monitor because it had all the features i wanted for 3 month old girl and it was a great deal.<br />it works great so far and i would recommend it for anyone with a baby.
best baby monitor. we returned a summer one. on this one the camera moves so doesnt matter where the baby is in the crib you can always see the baby, picture is great, sound excellent.
i love this dust ruffle!! high quality fabric and coordinates with other items in the space bot collection.  easy to put on.  haven't had to wash it yet, but don't expect any problems.
This is a hilarious gift for any baby.  I got this for my friend and he always uses it when he has company.  It' always gets a laugh out of guests.  Babies plus mustaches equals funny.
excellent at keeping my babies drinks cold, it has handles many falls without dents, my daughter finds it really easy to hold and drink out of, i would recommend this product to anyone.
the maxy moo moo bibs are great! not only do the various color options allow for easy outfit coordination, but they keep my baby's clothes dry from drool and spit-up! i wish i had more!
My son isn't a big pacifier guy but he loves chewing in this thing! It really provides some teething relief for him. He has 5 teeth already at 10 months and this teether holds up great!
It's adorable and the little bear does help the pacifier from flying out of my newborns mouth.  And if she does manage to accidentally spit it out, I've seen her nibbling on his legs 馃槉
these are great little belts for the money and work well in my sidecar. they fit in the tight sides perfectly! the quality is good to boot and with fast shipping from the hand in texas.
I love these rubber pacifiers! I love that they are chemical free & come from a natural plant, the rubber tree, vs being manufactured like silicon. My little one loves to suck on these!
Purchased as gift and they love it.  My granddaughter had other wubbanubs and they are great for newborns.  I would recommend it for anyone who is expecting.  It makes a wonderful gift.
my 2 year old loves her pillow! she gets excited every night to lay on &#34;my pillow and get tuck tucked in&#34;. perfect size and great quality!<br /><br />thanks for a great product!
Baby isn't here yet, so haven't used it yet but it is super cute! Can't wait to use it. Appears to be good quality. Still need to boil it before use tho. Exactly what I was looking for!
i like these because they stand on the counter and i don't have them rolling all over. they work great and i use them for lots of things. i love the variety of sizes.  i recommend them!
we have been using this brand and kind for two years since my baby was born. these are good. slicon doesnt hurt her face. soft and colors are good. after they were off, we get new ones.
the recipient of these was very happy with them. she is breast-feeding and feels these work much better than the ones more easily accessible in general stores like walmart, cvs, target.
these are great. easy to dispense when you're in a hurry (which is often the case). thinner than some other brands but still strong enough. they do exactly what they are intended to do.
the book ends are adorable and the colors are perfect!  the workmanship is fine and the shipping was done in a timely manner. packaging assured the product arrived in perfect condition.
works very well. highly recommend constantly making certain the conct remains if you haven't used it for awhile for safety's sake. same product was much more expensive at a local store.
these things are pretty neat and your kid will love them. and it helps comfort them too. only bad this is im afraid my nephew might be going to pre school with it lol.......just kidding
these things are pretty neat and your kid will love them. and it helps comfort them too. only bad this is im afraid my nephew might be going to pre school with it lol.......just kidding
My grandson loves this little wubbanub and he has 4 and when it is time to break the passy we will remove it and let him keep the stuffed animal.  Makes for an easy break from the passy
Babies seem to love WubbaNubs. As a grandmother with three granddaughters these are adorable and durable. The pacifier can be cut off if the child is older and wants it only as a lovie.
this is great. my daughter loves them. it is so useful. she was able to shop for 5 hours at the mall. her daughter was so content. she is only 3 weeks old. i would highly recommend this.
my little one kept losing her pacifier, so i had to get up at night to get it for her. this little toy is a wonderful solution! you can use your own pacifier, which makes it even better.
Our daughter loves her frog so much that we now have two of them.  This is great because if she wakes up in the middle of the night and wants her pacifier she can easily grab it herself!
I love these bottles feed. My boy is 11months and never a single colic.<br />It can be washed so easily, i gain so much time.<br />Thanks MAM, moreover i've got 4 for the price of 2.5 ;)
my daughter loves her silikids siliskin sippy cup! i love that its durable and really easy to wash! i also love that the top can be taken off and it converts to a cup for my bigger girl!
The product was not supposed to delivered until June 12- June 27 and I received the product on June 2.  I was very happy with the product and would purchase more items from this buyer!!!
Item shipped on time and was exactly what we expected. Our daughter loves it and it is a great self soothing product for infants teething and working toward teething. A must buy! Thanks!
this drying rack is fantastic! it can hold so many bottles, pump parts, and pacifiers.  helps keep the clutter down to a minimum on the counter, which is a huge help when bottle feeding.
I had bought these for my cousin's baby shower and they are so cute. I will be ordering another set since I just found out that I am going to be a grandma and the saying's are so so true
Very handy, i like the idea that it's machine washable and it's in perfect condition even after multiple rounds in the dryer. My babies love them, we have already ordered three of these.
This is a gift to be sent to Turkey for my great grand son.  It is adorable and will be excellent for a baby's small hands.  Shipping was fast and item was in original wrapper.  Love it.
My son has been using it since birth. So cute I get many compliments on it & my son loves it he squeezes the monkey tight when falling asleep lol a little hard to clean but I can manage.
we love these bottles. the extra pieces to wash aren't really a pain, we either just soak them in hot suds then rinse or put them in the munchkin dishwasher basket and run them in there.
these are by far the best breast milk storage bags. they can only hold up to 6 ounces, but the pour spout it has its a miracle. it is so easy to pour the milk into a bottle. i love them.
this our second one.  it is easy to use.  as child gets older he will be able to identify which instruments are playing.  his favorite is the harp.the toy is easy for the baby to handle.
These are wonderful because it allows my baby to grasp it better than just a pacifier. If she misses the pacifier part she can gum the legs and she likes looking at the different colors.
Got this for my nephew as an infant and it was his favorite. He would fall asleep rubbing the beany bag dog in his fingers. Seemed soothing and also helped with the pacifier not falling.
As usual, same quality from Advent Classic, we all love. I just bought this bottle because it is limited edition and I needed to stand out from the other moms who use the classic bottle.
this has been a life saver, we live in florida so you know its sunny, our little angel hates the sun in her face, this shade is perfect, it installs in seconds and keeps out the sun.....
After trying SEVERAL different (much cuter) pacifiers, we have stock piled these for our baby girl. They are the ONLY pacifiers she'll use and they have been lifesavers on many occasions!
Dr. Brown's pacifiers are the best for our baby(three months old).<br />She prefers them hands down over other brands I have tried.<br />They work and the quality of the product is great.
These are NFL endorsed and are absolutely adorable.  They are the perfect gift for that Packers fan with a new baby.  They are a bit big though, so not for newborns but for older infants.
I ordered this for my girlfriend as an 'early' birthday present! It arrived in FOUR days, packed well & was in GREAT condition! Would definately deal with you guys again!  Paul  Tucson,AZ
I bought this because my newborn kept spitting out his binky and it was driving me crazy... We love the giraffe because I can prop the giraffe against him and keep the binky in his mouth.
My son will only take these pacifiers, and only on occasion.  These are a little harder/thicker than the 0-3mo soothies, which is fine with my son!  Easy to use, clean, etc.  Great price.
I am so pleased with this adorable erosion of the elephant wubbanub. This product is not only cute, it's a lifesaver for babies who constantly spit out their pacifier. Highly recommended.
This is the ONLY pacifier that my child would take! He is not fooled by any other pacifier! They are cute and stylish, durable, but the blue &#34;colts&#34; emblem rubs off with cleaning.
I have given these are baby shower gifts on multiple occasions and bought them for my two nieces. I always get the same review from the Moms...&#34;My child loves her/his Wubbanub!!!&#34;
My 3 month old daughter absolutely loves this!! She likes to try to hold onto thing while she's sleeping and this is perfect!! I will definitely buy more and will also buy them as gifts!!
each of my kids has this hamper in their room. it's the right size if you do laundy once a week. it's easy to carry to the laundry room, the perfect size, and can be left out in the open.
This is basically the best idea since diapers and onesies. My son loves his monkey so much he holds hands with him when he sleeps. We bought several so we have them in all his nap places.
These are major lifesavers when it comes to keeping your infant asleep when needed! They are durable and convienient. Even after the pacifier stage they have a stuffed animal for comfort.
We have had this for almost seven years and even though we no longer need it for what it is, it is still awesome. My husband has actually just recently made it into a bookshelf on wheels.
i was afraid this was going to look cheap because of the price but it looks like a good quality my only complaint is the stylus is cheap plastic but it was free with it so not a big deal.
this gate has held up well with almost one year of heavy use. the gate is easy to open and doesn't rip off the wall like the other gate we have. i highly recommend this high quality gate.
As soon as mu girlfriend gave this to her new baby ... she and her husband started laughing so hard & taking pictures. I was delighted. I got texts and FB msgs for days. It made my month.
this is a healthy way to keep baby happy, stress free  and have some freedom to get tasks done with a happy baby!  A great tool for any parents lucky enough to have a baby  who love them!
Perfect for my newborn to keep in her mouth.  Now they she's not exactly a newborn it's easy to keep track of and find when she tosses it or in the middle of the night when she cries out.
the level two nipples for dr. brown's wide neck bottles are just another step in progressing my child's development.  i am quite satisfied with the product, and i know others will be too.
very cute, i will enjoy putting my baby in this. i originally bought it because of it's unisex quality when i wanted to be surprised, but that didn't last long. my son will look adorable.
My son loves these. I think the teat has an &#34;easy to hold in the mouth&#34; shape. I've compared it to other pacifiers from different brands and this seems to be the most comfortable.
We have tried a bunch of pacis for our daughter but these are the only she will take. And by judging by the amount of kiddos in her daycare that use these, I'm sure they are a top seller.
I like that this stays on my child's chest while she sleeps, so it doesn't wander too far (until she learns how to throw!).  Nice also to find it - very visible with the giraffe attached.
i am very happy with this purchase and so is my little one:)<br />it may not have some features i am not even aware of, but it's doing the job, kid is comfortable, and wasn't expensive...
amazing! it's a modern technical when i first time knew it. it comes with lovely pictures and gentle music. this is the best recommend if you want to buy for a gift. babies gonna love it!
i love this mobile and so does my baby.  it was the first item that would get (and hold) her attention when she was a few weeks old.  it's so cute, i decorated the whole nursery around it.
I don't have a whole lot to say about these pacifiers.  The baby likes them, they work.  Sometimes the cat likes them too...that part isn't so good, but it's not the fault of the pacifier.
My child only uses Soothie pacifiers, and I found the wubbanubs...and my baby loves it.  I recommend wubbanubs to all babies.  They usually stay in place, better than the pacifiers itself.
my daughter is a pacifier junkie, and while it would be nice to start weaning her off of them, i value my sleep at night, so i got these to replace lost ones and seems to satisfy her fine.
Can't live without these in our house.  My daughter loves the frog.  Arrived exactly as pictured.  Will definitely be ordering ,ore of these in the event that this one gets lost or breaks.
The website was very user friendly and the wubbanub was a perfect gift! Product was what the picture had shown and described.  Very happy with my purchase and the gift was a great success!
great bibs, easy to wipe clean and nice to have the bottom pouch to catch drips and spills. if you like keith haring and dr<br />seus, you will enjoy the cute graphics on the bibs as well.
These are so cute! The pacifier is just like the ones they give out in the hospital! It gives baby a great tactile experience with the soft animal ,and it is also great visual stimulation!
this bag is great for any type of on the go wet items, we personally use for cloth diapering when we are not at home but have also used for swimsuits. product is well made and very sturdy!
We absolutely love the Wubbanub pacifiers.  We were given one as a gift when our daughter was born and now we give them to everyone we know who has a baby.  They are fantastic and so cute.
I purchased the Ulubulu Pacifier Set for my sister that is expecting a boy in May. I received a lot of good comments about it. Several of my friends and colleagues have  purchase this set.
These are the only kind my newborn will take. Unfortunately we ended up getting the pink pack for our baby boy since you don't get to pick the color, but for around the house they'll work.
it works great, is very sturdy and easy to install! definitely recommend it to anyone  needing a gate-i happen to be restricting dogs but the hands free option really works and works well!
these are great for pumping on the go, especially when you want to fill philips avent natural instead of the medela bottles. they are solid construction and boil just like the name brands.
Love these!! Best newborn paci's out there.  I love the shape and I really love the scented ones.  My daughter loved these when she was little and they were the perfect size for a newborn.
Best baby product ever. Great for babies in NICU since the pacifier won't keep popping out. Ibhave bought just about every style for my son or his cousin. She loves hers even at 21 months!
Received these WubbaNub pacifiers very quickly and they are so cute and adorable !  They were the last pacifier one of my granddaughters would take and she is adorable holding on to them !
My son loves these and after taking his bottle away at 1 year, these were the only thing that saved us at night time! They are strong, perfect for little fingers! Most definitely soothing!
These are very nice teethers. They are easy for my 3 month old to grip. They are nice and small and light which makes them easy for young teethers to handle. The vanilla scent is nice too.
omg talk about money well spent! i wasn't expecting that much when i purchased this pacifier but wow. the mustache part of the paci was made very well! almost like a soft silicone texture.
For the hipster in every parent.  We purchased this as a baby shower gift from a list.  Parents love it and it looks exactly like the picture.  Its a sucker, what else do you need to know?
My daughter loves them. We get compliments from everyone about them. She will not use anything else. I can leave one in her diaper bag, one at home, and one at grandma's. We LOVE wubbanub!
we use this mattress for when we travel. it fits in graco (one grandma's pnp) and a cosco (other grandmother's pnp). daughter sleeps well and the pnp sheet works for it too. great product!
My son loves his pacifier and this has been a huge help at night when he was 5 weeks old. Now he is almost 3 months old and he loves to hold on to the legs. I would highly recommend these!
My baby loves these.  I really like that they are natural rubber.  So far its holding up well and she uses it every day.  It has not caused any nipple confusion either with breast feeding.
Part of an outstanding pirate themed diaper cake i made it is so cute and once the little guy arrives we shall see how he likes it but as a mom and a gift giver to a mom to be i loved it!!
My daughter loves her wubbanub. I thought it was very cute. She is 2 months old and can easily hold it and put it back in her mouth if it falls out. I am very satisfied with this purchase.
used the animal alphabets along with the  jungle animal decals to decorate my granddaughter's room  they were easy to apply.  the room looks adorable and she loves them.  highly recommend.
it took a few tries, but after we figured it out, my baby lived in this! we took walks and did chores together, and she loves to see what i'm doing! she's now a year old and we still use it
i love this gate!!!! i babysit at home and was looking for a gate that will go between my loving room and dining room. it took me a long time to find something!!!! you wont be disappointed!
fantastic coverage of granddaughters eyes. i brought them into my shop to test them (licensed optician) and they pass uv and light transfer. buying for my other granddaughter and my nephew.
haven't used the cover yet as i have about another week or so before our twins arrive, but love the aqua color and softness of the minky fabric. looks great in our gray/aqua/yellow nursery.
My little man loves this pacifier! This is the only brand he will use. The large vent holes on the sides are great for him to get air but he also loves to stick his tongue out of the sides.
we've used each set and my daughter likes both of them equally. it's fun for her to see her food transform to shapes and she will eat more if she thinks the food is fun. this worked for us.
I love these bottles. Natural nipple helps baby like them too. Too many pieces but easy to pop in the microwave for a quick sterilization. And the paci's are the only brand my lo will take.
Love these binkies. They are more durable then the newborn ones. I Used them with all of my children. It is the only binky they will take. Thank you so much for the fast and speedy service.
This lamb is adorable. Really cute. I love its tiny pink nose. Our daughter loves the stability of the WubbaNub and the shape of the soothie. Everything came well packaged and came quickly.
Our first GumDrop was given to us by our doula.  We had tried others, but for some reason our son only took to this brand.  Ended up buying four more during the two years he used a soother.
We tried a few different types of pacifiers before these. These were the only ones that my daughter would use, so we bought a bunch of them. They last well through washes and sterilization.
This is my favorite gift to give for a baby shower! Puddles the Frog is my favorite, The cow and monkey are cute too. This is such a unique gift and such a great idea. LOVE, LOVE LOVE them.
Bought these for my new great-nephew. From what I understand, these are 'good ones'. Something about the inside construction. Anyway, these are his favorites, of course.<br /><br />Go Blue!
i bought these for my nephew. he's 7 months now and for the past 2 he's been able to hold these well. they have places for little hands to grab and the colors are bright. i recommend these.
My baby girl loves her wubbaNub! It's a cute cuddly stuffed animal with her comfort pacifier. When she would chew through the pacifier I would cut it off and she would still have her puppy.
What's not to love? A nuk, the brand most hospitals use - plus a cute dog? it's great for a child to grow with.  when you are ready to have them be done with the nuk, you simply cut it off!
These are the standard philips avent pacis, just with a larger (and cuter!) outer portion.  My daughter loved them.  Never had problems with staining or excessive moisture around her mouth.
this is the best play yard ever. from newborn to toddlers. i have used this for years and it is still in awesome shape! i especially loved the newborn napper they don't all come with these!
This is my daughter's favorite pacifier because it is just like the one she had in the hospital, it is my favorite pacifier because she can hold it herself! Well constructed, washes easily.
All I know is that both of my daughters (they are 17 months apart) LOVE these pacis....for some reason, they like the newborn ones, even though my oldest is two.  They really are pacifiers!
so comfortable, very high quality, and adorable.  this was the only place my son would sleep for months. he preferred to sleep on his monkey mat, rather than in his crib. and it's portable!
this is a beautiful starter bottle set. my baby loves the bottles, and i love them because they are easy to clean. my baby also prefers the pacis that come in this set to other name brands.
so far, so good with this monitor.  i ordered it to replace a graco monitor that would not keep a charge.  this one has been very reliable and i think it looks cool lit up in my son's room.
it is very sweet and cute, and soft. and it plays very well. and it arrived in good time, and in excellent condition. the pull cord is made very well and if used properly will last forever.
Great for in the car so you can reach behind you and locate the pacifier if it falls out. Doubles as a toy for your baby too. The only downside is you cannot wash or sterilize the pacifier.
My daughter loves the WunnaNub's plush doll cat and we love it as well.  It is big enough so we don't lose it, which saves on the cost of the other lost cheaters. Great product for parents.
we absolutely love this crib! it's small enough that we can fit it in our bedroom but large enough he has room to grow. at eight months and twenty one pounds that is really important to us!
i purchased one of these off of my friend's babiesrus registry for her baby shower. she loved it so much that when i needed a new chair i decided to get one of these from amazon (cheaper!).
great for toddlers learning to eat with spoon and fork-- the forks w plastic prongs are too hard for kids to grab the food.  the lip on the plate helps them scoop food up. highly recommend.
This was the only pacifier my son would take. But while sterilizing during a football game, my husband melted the only ones we had. This order came promptly and at a good price for 6 units.
great bag! i love the quality, look, soft red inside, and it arrived very quickly. only complaint is that the wipes container was defective, but didn't need it anyway, so no problem for me.
My daughter absolutely adores her wubbanub!! The giraffe is super cute.. At first I thought it was a bit small in size, but later realize it is the perfect size for an infant to hang on to.
our delivery nurse gave us and recommended these pacifiers and i ordered these so my daughter always had a new one and they are exactly like the ones provided at hospital. with added design!
daughter loves the variety and the high contrast. the ball is just the right size for her little hands. i likes that items are different developmental levels such as the book and the rattle.
i bought this to monitor my mother who had alzeimers when she was bed ridden.<br />i only used it for 16 days so i cant state how long it would last,but it really helped me when i needed it.
Before my dog chewed the this up :( My daughter LOVED it. She doesn't take this type of pacifier as we started her on a different one at birth but she still loved to play with it. Thank you!
These are great and go well with the Munchkin Latch bottle system. It helps avoid nipple confusion. However, my son seems to prefer the Chicco Natural Fit pacifiers, but will use both kinds.
Eco friendly and safe. My baby is 100% breastfed and took these with no hesitation. He likes to suck a lot and momma needed a break. I love the fact that these are 100% natural hevea rubber.
I love Avent products anyway, but the fact that this has UK references on it was a big selling point for me. The package came very quickly and I would definitely recommend this seller again!
fits perfect in my 2012 malibu. the kids will never stop kicking but at least now i don't have to clean mud off all of the time. nice durable fabric and they are easy to attach to head rest.
My daughter loves all her wubbanubs. I bought 4, 'cause she doesn't accept any other pacifier. The Yellow Duck is her favourite! I guess she likes the colors. It's my favourite too, so cute!
My granddaughter loves her Elephant!  The product is very durable and easy to clean.  It also is very soft and easy for little hands to manipulate.  I have purchased more including as gifts.
I love this product as my two older boys used it when they were babies. Now having the 3rd son I needed for my son. its soothing pacifier and I love it how it doesn't hurt the baby's mouth..

These are the only pacifiers I could get my baby to take.  They are also the kind attached to the Wub-a-nubs, which I highly recommend.  These we use for backup when we forget the Wub-a-nub.
These are the absolute best pacifiers ever. They are similar to the soothie pacifiers, but these ones are softer, making them better for newborns and easier for them to keep in their mouths.
this adorable lamb stuffed animal and pillow is so soft and cute. my little girl just loves its. we bought it for her at 10 months and she immediately loved snuggling it and playing with it.
My daughter used these up to 3 months! Absolutely loved them; just hard to keep them in the baby's mouth. Besides that frustration if trying to keep the bink in the mouth, excellent product!
i have purchased many diaper bags, and this will be the last one. i found what i've been looking for, this is perfect it stays upright so it is easy to look for items, and organize them too!
Received exactly what I ordered. I wish you could specify a color rather than assorted, though.  Should specify boy (blue) or girl (pink) or neutral (green or yellow).<br /><br />Carol Price
these were the first pocket diapers we bought. i have nothing to compare them to besides my fst and covers. i really like them! they are great for my relatives to use abs gray for overnight.
our baby is doing great with her new amber necklace.  she has gone from being miserable (and making us miserable too!) to being her happy self again.  thanks for offering this great product!
This tiger is by far the softest WubbaNub. The 'hairs' under the ears are a great texture for little hands. The legs are larger than other ones we have had. Highly recommend &#34;Tigee&#34;.
even though we only used it for a few months, it worked great, much easier than wrapping and she never got out.  she outgrew it before we were done using it, but she is a big baby.  love it.
they don't get spit/water trapped inside like the traditional pacifier.   so they don't get moldy and they last longer. you can put them in the mouth at any angle - great for when it's dark.
loving this crib pad. waterproof, fits great, and nice quality. looks like some reviewers shrunk their covers... i'd recommend washing on cold and drying on delicate, low heat to avoid this.
My boys love these!  They are absolutely machine washable! The manufacture recommends air drying but I little in the dryer anyway. Just be sure you don't use fabric softener or dryer sheets.
i absolutely love penguins so when i saw this i had to get it for my nephew for christmas. needless to say he loves it as much as i love penguins. much larger than expected and very durable!
Every parent must have this if your child likes the pacifier. My daughter loves her paci but had a hard time going to sleep as she would drop it, this helped correct that problem. Thank you.
Baby boy loves the Soothie pacifier.  The plush toy makes it easy to prop up on the baby so the pacifier stays in place.  Also helps me keep it from hitting the ground when moving him around.
My 2 month old loves the puppy wubbabub!  It helps him guide the pacifier to his mouth and sometimes I catch him petting this puppy just like we taught him to pet the family dog.  Super cute!
my baby loves them and by the way even though she is 10 months, she prefers these to 3+ mo, she likes that they are soft. She has teeth for like 4 months and never bit it through or anything.
i have three of these!  after buying one and comparing it to a britax protector i bought two more.  it makes the car seat more snug fitting, and does a great job protecting leather interiors.
My 10 month old loves this, she sleeps with it every night. My favorite thing about it is that it never gets lost like her other binkies. I am going to buy an extra to keep in the diaper bag.
product arrived promptly and i am totally satisfied with my purchase.  the carter's shopping cart baby cover is well made, and the storage space holds small items to keep little fingers busy!
It is my daughter's first baby and it's a girl!!!!! This pacifier was a little &#34;lighter&#34; in color than it looks on here, but I love it! and I know mom, dad, and baby will love it too!
this teether is cute. it's not super soft, but sometimes my son prefers something harder to chew on while teething than a really squishy teether.  it's also fun becaus it doubles as a rattle.
i am a mom of 4 and a child care provider and i am so pleased with this chair!  it is portable and very easy to set up.  i wish i had had this with my first 3 children.  well worth the money.
My 4.5 mo son loves the wubbanub! I personally love cats, so that's why I picked out this one. I didn't like the red dog and yellow duck sold at babies r us. I would recommend this to anyone!
I tried countless other pacifiers with no luck before finding these. My son loves these and they really help him at nap time. Glad to find them because the stores are no longer carrying them.
Won't buy any brand but MAM. My son loves them. Love the glow in the dark feature as it makes it easy to find during the middle of the night or during the day if it has fallen under the crib!
great deal,<br />super price for a nice take-along swing!<br />my grandson will love this... and his mom won't have to pack up hers...<br />at this price i can keep this one here as an extra!
such a stylish and functional bib! perfect for a teething baby, one lasts all day, which is easier than changing clothes all day. super cute patterns, i will be buying more for a shower gift.
My grandson lost his &#34;monkey&#34; and we needed to get one fast as the stores were sold out.  He loves &#34;monkey&#34; because he can hold onto it while he uses the pacifier. Great idea.
awesome.  as others have stated,install upside down.  my son is no longer able to open the doors and the lock stays in place unlike the type that attach with sticky strips.  highly recommend.
Both of my kids adore these pacifiers! They are sturdy, fit their mouths well, and don't fall out easily. They are cheaper to buy in store though, so do that if you can to save a few dollars.
Purchased this as a gift. It is so funny to see baby use this - he looks like he is kissing a kitten!<br />Pacifiers are necessities and this one is soooo cute<br /><br />Item arrived on time
It's been a year since I bought this towel for my son, and it's held up great. He still loves it, and he uses it every time we go swimming. It wasn't cheap, but I'm so glad I got one for him!
i bought this after accidentally flashing a stranger at a children's museum in my old cover. this is a great size and keeps me covered even with a wiggly 6 month old. the pattern is cute too.
We had to order this as a back up to the one we already had.  My daughter really loves these.  The only downside is how long they take to dry when you wash them.  Hence the need for an extra!
this was a good find for a bath toy.  when you shake it; it makes a sound, but not that loud.  and the &#34;shower&#34; like drip from the ball when there is water in it makes my child laugh.
i bought this for my one year old and he absolutely loves it! a great teether too! he also enjoys having his few teeth brushed when he isn't chewing on it. a must need for every baby/toddler!
i bought these kits waaaaaay cheaper at sweetbottoms.com<br />i bought two of these kits and they're awesome. i'd say i need two more for a complete newborn stash. super simple to use n wash.
my son quickly learned to remove the traditional style plugs.  we placed these in the eye level outlets.  sometimes guests come over and even the adults can't figure out how to take them off.
exactly what we were looking for.  we have a big hallway but wanted to be able to keep the dog out of certain areas.  only complaint is the instruction to install where little hard to follow.
My son loved these pacifiers.... although he didn't suck on them, just let them hang out of his mouth.  They have to be replaced often because of the natural rubber so they can get expensive.
When my son was born in 2008, the hospital gave us one of these and he loved it. I just had a baby girl and searched like CRAZY to find these again, and she loves them just as much as he did!
kids will love this everytime they take a bath/shower. fun to have and great for gifts for new parents! i purchased several for the bathrooms and grandparents house too. easy to put on facet!
my daughter wore these for a very long time and i haven't seen any wear and tear on them what so ever. even after a year later they are still in great shape, i am sad that she outgrew these!!
i can't live without these things. we use the sippy cups with straws & this cleans them out very well. nice and cheap & durable. one pack lasts about 6 weeks. great product. so glad it exists.
Nice to have as now I can keep my binkies in one place but this isn't realy necessary. Still, it's nice to have one and the strap has a snap on one end so you can attach it to your diaper bag.
We've gone through our share of wubbanubs but I just had to take the time to comment on the velour textures of the Mango Monkey Mary Meyer wubbanub!!! Definitely worth the price for this one!!
these are the best transition nipples from bottle to cup, but they are a bit expensive for just the nipples, i just wish they had them in the stores... luckily i was able to get free shipping.
my daughter loves this. also, every kid that she plays with, including older kids, love this. its the cutest toy ever. the yellow section plays music and the little apple has a squeeker in it.
My wife has wanted a Serta sheep for years and I finally got her this little guy a little while ago and she loves it.  It is well made, the price was good, and it is just all around very cute.
bought this for my car so that my wife and i can alternate taking and picking up our child from day care.<br /><br />works just like the one that comes with the b-safe car seat. no complaints!
These are the only pacifiers our daughter has ever taken. She loves them and so do we! Knowing that she's not sucking on a chemical-filled piece of plastic makes me feel a million times safer.
Fits two pacifiers easily. Well made product, easy to clean and stylish. This product always keeps your pacifiers readily available and easy to find. A must have for your on the go diaper bag.
My son loves these! They are so cute. When needed to be washed I just hand wash the stuffed animal with light mild soap and put in the dryer on low heat for a few minutes at a time or air dry.
Glow in the dark! What a great concept...who ever thought of this is a genius! Makes finding the lost paci easy for my little one so I don't have to get up and do it for him. Love, Love, Love!
this thing is nifty. had that &#34;new&#34; smell, i expect that to fade. mini perforations for breathability, do not know about waterproof-ness yet. great for a short rifle wrap or headscarf.
Yes this is the same standard pacifier we received at the hospital and of course the only one our son likes.  Nothing fancy and cheaper than most...gets the job done!  Thank God for simplicity
Got this pacifier today, hoped my 4 month baby will take it, but he wont((( tried different kinds of pacis, they don't work for us( like this paci for its shape and meterial, very good quality
My little boy loves these. We have been using the duck since he was born. I got this one to keep one at my mom's house. He loves to hold them and it's easy for them to put back in their mouth.
i love this pad! when it arrived it was a lot bigger than i anticipated.  it is actually longer than the changing table we bought but because of the safety straps it doesn't pose a safety risk
I use orthodontic pacifiers, so this holder is just the right size to hold 2 of them. It comes in fun colors and can be clipped onto a purse handle, diaper bag strap or stroller bar! Love it!!
these are the only pacifiers I buy for my babies. They are all natural and are easy to clean with no cracks or seams. It is all one continuous piece so there are no place for germs to hideout.
I love how cute and colorful this pacifier is. The giraffes is so unique and cute. We haven't used this paci yet, but I'm sure my daughter will love it as much as she loves her other Wubbanubs
best ever tho my son now will only take his connected to stuffed animal on his wub a nub they are very worth it and should try , we use the singles as back up in diaper bags and in the bathtub
Before we got this were were always losing pacifiers. Usually in the car. A friend recommended WubbaNub to us and we are so grateful.  My son loves it. It's soft and very easy for him to hold.
this little bear is so soft and cuddly. perfect size for my four month old. the color is a little lighter than in the picture. i like the actual color better than the one pictured. very happy.
it was everything that i wanted for my granddaughter. i'd looked in local stores and couldn't find this lamp to complete her frozen bedroom. so one little girl will be thrilled come christmas.
This is our son's favorite pacifier.  We've tried them all.  He has a synthetic allergy, so we do all natural products.  This is a hit.  We've tried all of the pacifiers out there.  These win.
It's amazing, it works exactly as they advertise!!! It really closes when it's dropped, the plastic closure pieces somewhat press on my baby's cheeks but I think it's because he has a fat face
This worked great for my son, but he just does not like pacifiers.  Neither of my boys did.  It was nice to be able to tuck it into a blanket to keep it in his mouth though when he was little.
My 2 month old daughter constantly loses her pacis, the wubba has given her something to hang on to.... it's great for the trips where I can't put her paci back in for her over and over again.
this is a very nice bassinet skirt. i was going to sew my own for my daughter but when i saw this, i decided to give it a try.  i'm very impressed. after a little pressing, it looks beautiful!
Was suprise because wehn i turn off the light the holder was glowing.its nice cos in the middle of the night dont need to actually get up and find where is the pacifier went. Will recommend it
i bought 4 of these and gave them as gifts to my grandchildren's grandparents - myself included.  much better quality than i have found in similar products.  a creative and treasured keepsake.
son loves these. used with my daughter too.<br />For breastfed babies, the nipple is perfect.<br />Have ordered and reordered so many times. Now just wish they wouldn't go missing all the time!
I love this thing!  My 9wk old son rolls to his side to sleep, and the wubbanub stays tucked in his arms - he can get the paci back in his mouth by himself, saving me many trips into his room:)
This is one of the BEST products NUK could come up with! I have used NUK pacifiers since day 1 for both of my babies! The best thing is they are orthodontic! You could never go wrong with this!
got these as replacements. they say to replace them every 3 months or so. sounds good to me. best deal i found. these work on all 3 types of avent pumps, i have the manual, the uno and the duo.
super quick to ship! my son used it until he was 10 months old! he loved it! easy to clean, light weight and easy to move with one hand. have recommended to all our friends who are new parents.
i use it to keep my 2 year old grandson out of hazardous areas. unlike many other similar products, it is extremely easy to open for an adult while virtually impossible for my grandson to open.
this is an expensive but really good car seat.  the only gripe is that older kids that are small for their age and still must be rear facing are a recline position that they usually don't like.
Glow in the dark pacifiers...genius!!! Our little one loves the MAM pacifiers (won't take any others since we started using them). These are great to be able to find in the middle of the night.
I gave this a good rating but I really don't know. It was a gift for a friend and the baby passed away. Didn't even get to use it. You never ask for a gift back, that's rude. So it was donated.
i purchased (2) sets of these and love them.  they are easy to install and easy to operate from the front or back seats.  the shades provide ample protection from sunlight to the grandchildren.
Keeps the binky in sight which I ended up Liking the most. Babies can also easily hold on to this really easily. And I truly believe that Wubbanub helped with my son grabbing things on his own.
this product is truly the easiest children's product i have ever used.  it always sets up with no complications and works perfectly!  i love it because it is so simple and the children love it.
Good price. My daughter is exclusively breast fed. She won't take any bottles and it took me forever to find a soother she would take. These are the winner, and I am glad they aren't expensive.
Our baby girl loves this, life saver. The weight of the stuffed animal is the best quality of this product because if she pops it out of her mouth it stays put so it doesn't fall on the ground.
My son has been drooling and chewing all over the other straps I've purchased, making them dingy and gross. These don't show dirt & grim as bad. They seem like they will hold up over time, too!
i first got this product to go camping and keep up with potty training my toddler. i loved how compact it is, so i bought more of them to take anywhere (it is great to use in public bathrooms).
This type of pacifier is the only kind that my little girl will take. No, the ones I received were not the ones pictured but really, who cares? She is happy and not crying which makes me happy.
This thing has been a lifesaver! It holds 2 pacifiers, and 1 pacifier clip. Or it can hold 3 pacifiers without any clips. I use the Nuk pacifiers. It will only really hold 2 smoothies at a time
I love this! Thanks to the stuffed animal it stays in place, even when baby spits it out. Never fell on the floor yet! I exclusively breastfeed and this pacifier hasn't caused nipple confusion.
My order of the amber teething necklace was shipped quickly. It was packaged in a beautiful bag and the necklace is high-quality. I would definitely recommend this seller and product to anyone.
i ordered this and two days later i got it in the mail! it is for my daughter. i loved how it was packaged. everything is perfect. i didn't think i'd get it that fast. and it was really cheap!!
mounted these on the glass door to the patio last summer and no issues so far even after cleaning the glass few times (mounted on the inside) - plus it looks great, like etched glass - stylish.
a temporary need, but the travel my brest friend was wonderful for the first 5 months of my baby's life. meant we could go out and i wouldn't have to worry about how to hold up my baby to feed.
I recieved the item fast and as decribed,my daughter loves it,since she was born shes been all about monkeys and this was perfect for her.  Thanks so much for a great service and a perfect toy.
i bought this pack n play to keep at my house for my grandbabies. i love the diaper changing table, it comes off very easily it doesn't fold over like most pack n plays. that is a nice feature.
this blanket is awesome. the softest ever. it is my two year old daughter's new favorite.<br />also of note, the colors on this blanket are vivid and brilliant. it truly captures the ygg style.
I gave them as a gift.  They are a fun and family likes them.  They were priced well at amazon and the store that shipped them handled my issues quickly with no errors.  I would recommend them.
This is my grandbaby's favorite pacifier and we tried several from other companies. Thank you for giving her something to hold onto. Now we have three, so if she loses one there is one waiting.
This is the only pacifier my baby could keep in her mouth. She wouldn't take any other kinds. She stopped wanting any pacifiers around 5 months, so I am happy we won't have to wean her off one.
Love this lamb! Soo cute! My daughter loves it! We also own the giraffe and elephant which are great too!! These also make perfect shower gifts I give them to all my friends! Highly recommended
Definitely my sons favorite pacifier!  We are strictly nursing and no problems with nipple confusion either.  Started using around 2 weeks old, and still successfully nursing with no confusion.
Product was BPA free and good for use with infants, so I was even more delighted that the pacifiers read &#34;Mute Button&#34; and &#34;Pull to Sound Alarm&#34; -- the bonus is, she loves them!
my granddaughter's favorite game is peek a boo so when a friend of mine told me she saw this bear i had to get it! she loves it! it also will be a great keepsake as she grows! she is 13 months!
my 10 month old loves to chew on this a little. she only had 6 teeth so far so we don't so too much with it yet, just getting her used to it. it's soft and she likes the feeling of the bristles.
These were the only paci's our daughter (who is now 15 months) would take. They come in fun, bright colors, which is great because that makes them easier to find at the bottom of the diaper bag!
Shipping was very fast for this product. I am expecting so I didn't get to use this yet for the baby, but I did get it out of the package and there was not 1 thing wrong with it. It was perfect!
Perfect for any baby Patriots fan, my little guy is a little picky when it comes to pacifiers but took these ones right away and now he looks like a real Pats fan and ready for football season!!
Very cute and matches with the rest of the Laguna theme. Light is slightly dim but enough to see what you are doing. A baby's room doesn't need to be brighter. I'm very happy with this purchase.
My daughter absolutely loves these pacifiers!  She won't take any other kind, plus they are super cute..... we have the giraffe and pink pony as well and i am always getting compliments on them.
Gift for my cousin. Saw the pacifier on Shark Tank, thought it was very ingenious. Ordered it the same night. My lil cousin is still to young to appreciate it, but we will see as she gets older.
With my first child, we lost pacifiers like crazy.  I bought this for our daughter and it is the only pacifier we use.  It falls out of her mouth less and she likes to hold onto the beanie baby.
looks good for a potty, my toddler girl can successfully use it, and it is easy to empty. what more could you ask for from a potty chair? now if only it could actually teach a toddler to use it!
We love our moo cow!!  It's even cuter in person- if you can believe that!  These wubanubs are GENIUS!  I went from losing EVERY pacifier to holding on to TWO!  Plus, it's a nice toy as well! :)
love the glasses.  i purchased them for my 22 month old grandchild, and they are unbreakable, the first challenge they went through was being twisted around and they made it.  good price also.馃槉
Love the glow feature! My son likes to throw his paci around and this makes it super easy to find in the middle of the night. He has even been able to find it on his own if it stays in the crib!
mam binkies are our favorite. these were a little more expensive than getting them in store (7.99 vs 5.99 or less) but i have never been able to find these colors in our local stores. i'm happy!
This is a great product! Perfect for babies and young kids. My nephew is only a few months old and he already learned to hold it and put it back in his mouth. Much easier than a regular pacifier
got this for my friend in seattle as christmas gift. she likes the design, color, warm feeling and quality. very happy with the purchase. it seems to be a great gift idea in this holiday season.
My daughter loves it !! This product is so great. My baby loves biting on the monkey itself. This also helps keeping the soother in her mouth when she is try to sleep. I am ordering another one.
We are on our 3 rd one.  My son loves it.  He sleeps with it every night & for naps.  The 1st one he pulled the paci off the dog.  The second we lost.  We are on our 3rd one.  Buy more than one.
this was a gift that was one of my daughter's favorites. it entertains the baby while in the car seat, and can be easily taken off and used anywhere. i have purchased it for every new mom since.
The elephant wubbanub is amazing! It is the perfect weight to keep the pacifier in her mouth and at the right angle. We have the duck wubbanub also, but it does not work at well at the elephant!
absolutely love it. very helpful. clear sound. easy to use. looks nice. small and portable. no complaints. just don't carry the parent monitor into the baby's room or there is a squeaking noise.
the high sides on this plate are very helpful to a toddler trying to get food onto his utensils. he likes having food in the big section and dips in the smaller. colors are good. indestructible.
This is a brilliant invention. My twins like smoothie pacifiers anywa, and this helps the keep it in their mouths. The only drawback is its hard to clean and sterilize, but well worth it anyway.

great product. my 16 month old discovered how to push buttons on my cable box, and this has stopped him from doing that! very happy. delivery was excellent too-arrived much faster than expected.
these are amazing for heavy wetters! my son pees through almost everything and this gets us by each day without having to change his outfit with each diaper change! i love them! highly recommend
this booster seat is absolutely fantastic!  it's portable and very durable.  we've been using it since my grandson was old enough to sit up in it and a year later, he's still using it.  love it!
i bought this for storage in our playroom.  i also have my girls' big doll house on top if it for easier playing access.  it was fairly simple to put together and is very sturdy.  great product!
My daughter absolutely loves these. They are soft & perfect gor little hsnds to grip. We have gone through several of them. Some were lost & the nipple on some got worn down due to frequent use.
very easy to pop out the cubes of baby food. i love that it keeps the food covered, clean, and free of other food odors from the freezer/frig. i use one tray for fruits, and the other for veggies
great waterproof mattress that we placed right on top of the mini-crib mattress. the crib sheets fit nice and snug over both mattresses, and will protect the actual crib mattress during it's use.
Baby loves her wubba. Very easy for her to find the nipple after taking a break from sucking. The only downside is sanitizing nipple everyday can be quite a pain with having to avoid wetting dog.
i ended up getting this toy since i have heard such good things from it that i just had to get it for my 2 month old. he loves it so far! it so adorable and cute! very soft and good teether also.
as far as i can tell this is very well made.  it fits perfectly and is very comfortable to use in the car.  i am a short adult who needs this adjuster in order to be comfortable in the seat belt.
She loves these, only type that she can suck on being so little and all, they are so great to have that I bought more for her! I recommend these for anyone, especially if you have a preemie baby!
my son loved this toy when he was 8 months old and still loves it now that he is a year old. the only down side is that it does not walk or make noise for a long period of time. we still love it!
this carseat was an excellent choice for us because we're interested in extended-rear facing. our one-year old is very petite and we expect this carseat to continue to be the perfect one for her.
super cute gift.bought it for a friend who just had a little baby girl.comes in nice box ,adorable teddy bear, elegant and classic for a present. Made of quality materials, i highly recommend :-)
Terrific product! We were given one of these as a gift, and we loved it so much that we bought another so as to never be without one. In fact, I'm buying some as gifts to other expecting parents.
Great in the car at night, prefect for finding in their crib in the dark.  So cute. Mam are  the best pacifiers. These were perfect for my 3mos old grandson. They are well made and easy to clean.
I purchased this as a Christmas gift and it made the entire day!  We all couldn't stop laughing when the baby put it in his mouth!  Definitely makes for great pictures on facebook and chuckles!!!
this was to convert my gate to go on my banister, and it works like a charm!  feels safe and secure, doesn't slide at all, my son stands on the other side and rattles it and nothing happens. yay!
i wasn't sure hands free pumping would be a possibility but this holds the pump cups on nice and tight for perfect suction. it's soft and comfy, and is made with quality material so it will last.
I bought this for my mom for her birthday. I just received it and I love it. It's very clean and the cutest little sheep. I will update this when my mom opens it and tell what she thinks as well.
just got it from amazon today, and a tub of generic apple sauce from our friendly neighbor. i just used a spare kitchen squeeze bottle to fill 10 pouches in minutes. definitely worth buying them.
Bought these as a gift for a new mom and didn't even realize that the handles glow in the dark.<br /><br />I have a 6 month old and might just order a few of these for myself.  SO handy at night!
product of excellent quality, cost, utility, very practical, lightweight, lightweight, very well packaged and rapidly reach the destination highly recommended for the purchase of other customers.
The friend I purchased this for said it was the best gift she received and that she couldn't live without it. I purchased both the monkey and giraffe, they have held up well and are easy to wash.
I bought this for my niece and she loves it! I would recommend to every mom to buy two just in case you leave one at grandmas house. She is six months old and takes it with her wherever she goes!
this stays put wherever i placed it. i put it on my steps and corners for my toddler. i had tile steps in kitchen and living room. also have wood steps and countertop edges. none have fallen off.
cute and fun and works very well. i can't imagine not using a thermometer for baby's bath as i get paranoid with water temp. this product is great. gives you temperature in celsius also if needed.
Such a great accessory for an infant.  Stuffed toy attached to NUB pacifier keeps paci from slipping down in car seats, beds, etc., and is a cute plus to boot!  Excellent gift for any young thing!
Big one is for wet swimsuit or water shoes (I ordered a couple of bags in this size), small one is just right for Diva Cup. They are nice and cheery in my bag! Far more pleasant than a Ziploc bag.
I was looking for a blanket that was soft and warm, yet not too warm. I also wanted one that was feminine with a classic look. That's exactly what I got when I received this blanket. It's perfect.
i bought two of these - the lion and the orangutan, one for each of my kids. they're very cute and fit a lot of clothes and i love that you just unfold the tops and carry them to the laundry room.
It is hard to find the silicone pacifiers in the biggest size, but not on Amazon. My son refuses to use the latex kind. This is his favorite. Now we just need to figure out how to break the habit.
These are really cute and they stand out a bit from the same old, every day pacifier.  Perfect for sports fans, and they also match lots of little outfits, these are definitely a win at our house!
I use these for baby wreaths. They're very durable and I have yet to receive any complaints from new parents. They're so cute and meant to teach babies to hold things such as there bottles sooner.
This is the only pacifier that my 2 month old son will take. All other pacifiers we use he immediately spits out. I have absolutely no complaints about this product and highly recommend it to all.
we love this high chair. it is very sturdy, love the harness system and move-ability of this chair. our little girl loves sitting in this chair, very reasonably priced for what you get in the box.
i love these spouts, i used them for my first daughter and was trying to find replacements for the cups for my second daughter that just started using sippy cups. i am glad i found them on amazon!
this is my second safari friends lunch box.  both my kids have used these since age 15 months.  they are very durable and very easy for little hands to work and figure out.  and very cute designs!
Best pacifier EVER! We go through 5 pacifiers a week until someone got us this as a present. It is the only pacifier that stayed with us for six months. Attaching a stuffed animal to it is genius.
my daughter loves these. well built. never interfered with our breastfeeding. cant get these so cheap here in Australia so its also a bargain. always getting asked about them and they are so cute.
i am obsessed with hello kitty, and having a daughter tends to make me buy more things with hello kitty. i love this activity cube and it will definitely keep her preoccupied when she gets bigger.
i couldn't like this more for my 3 yr old.  it does drip one tiny drop when first turned upside down but afterwards nothing comes out.  so it's not 100% leak proof but it does a great job overall.
easy to adjust very comfortable,  zipper and with added extension for wider apart breasts.  also have halter straps so don't put it on too tight and cause clogged duct, just use the halter straps!
I love these binkies. We were given one for our daughter in the hospital, and its the only binkie she'll use. We've tried other ones but she spits them out. She loves these, so we had to stock up!
so, so, so good!  these plates are so sturdy.  completely microwave and dishwasher safe.  the portion sizes are perfect for a toddler.  wish there was an option to get plates with no sections too.
Perfect pacifier it was my daughters favorite she loved them and it kept them germ free when she dropped them at home I would recommend keeping it if my baby dropped in public but perfect for home
makes pumping at work and home so easy! i can't relax enough to &#34;let-down&#34; if i am holding onto the pump parts. so this fixed that problem. highly recommend for any working or pumping mama!
my daughter hates sippy cups... particularly the spout cups.  we have had luck with straw cups, and this is one of the few she's tolerated without throwing across the room.  so five stars it gets!!
The best pacifiers out there. We got this with our oldest son in the hospital 13 yrs ago. Now they make them for people to purchase on their own. We buy this for every babyshower gift we give away.
5 stars for this pacifier!<br /><br />My little one cannot fall asleep without it.<br />She's not a big pacifier user [only right before bed to fall asleep] but she will NOT use any other pacifier.
My 3 month old loves his wubbanubs, he snuggles it when he's sleeping and holds it when he's awake!this is the second one we bought, the giraffe is upper cute too. I would recommend it to everyone!
This product makes sanitizing pacifiers so easy and quick! I don't use bottles so I didn't need a big sanitizer, this is small so it doesn't take up much space at all. I wish I had found it sooner.
My 13 month old son loves the soft silicone pacifiers but the narrow ones were starting to buck out his 2 front teeth, these ones are wider and his teeth aligned better after we started using them.
My son loves the mams pacifiers.  These are the one kind that he keeps in his mouth. Love the glow in the dark feature. Helps us locate it during the night. Will and have bought over and over again
my 1.3yrs old son is obsessed with cars, and a fussy eater. this speed up eating and keep him on the table for long enough to finish his meal.<br /><br />the quality is excellent. worth the prince.
i have no issues with this mattress. my daughter isn't a very picky baby, but she sleeps very well on it. just the right about of firmness. not extremely firm and not too soft. and it's waterproof!
Great nook but it baby does not seem to be attached to the nook like my other kids were.  The stuffed animal makes it more of a toy so it is being played with as much as it is being used as a nook.
My daughter is 18 months old and still loves her &#34;froggie&#34;! She's been using it since she was a few months old. I had to get another one as a backup when the other one needed to be cleaned.
This is the only pacifier our son would take.  We have tried the soothies and Nuk brands, but he would just spit them out.  They have a cute design and I love the pacifier cover that comes with it!
It is hilarious. I bought 2 for my brother's twins and they look good in the box. It is a Xmas gift, so they haven't tried it yet, but everybody who saw them so far laughed, so it is a good sign :)
Our baby LOVES these! There really cool and the handle makes them great for night time as it folds and lays flat so baby don't pull it out with head movement during sleep. Wonderful product design!
My baby has always preferred the Nuk pacifiers over the soothies.  I feel that the &#34;contoured&#34; shape helps them keep it in their mouth better.  The bright colors and designs are cute, cute.
This and the soothie are the only pacifiers my daughter has ever taken. She's 18 months - in a pinch I've bought the 0-3 months ones, but they are very light. She prefers the weight of the 3+ ones.
These are the best pacifiers for nighttime pacifier replacement. Glows all night after some exposure to light. Of course your baby has to like the MAM style but that's simply an issue of preference.
my almost 2 year old absolutely loves this set.  she spent two or three day's carrying the pillow around with her.  i thought it might be a bit rough since it was so cheap, but its really very soft.
It is very adorable to see your baby with this little guy.  My baby loves it, sometimes for the binky and other times for the stuffed toy.  No more loosing the binky, its size makes it easy to find.
I love these pacifiers - my daughter hays regular pacifiers and these are the only ones she will use - we have 3 now and I just adore the giraffe- is so cute when she is holding it -,would recommend
My daughter loves these Pacifiers! I reccommend them for all expecting parents. The dog is especially appealing to her because of it's bright red color. Toy was shipped fast. Very happy customer. :)
These are best ever, i'm not going to get into details why, it's all been covered 500 times here already, i just wanted to give my vote and say that i am also one of the extremely satisfied parents.
My daughter loves the MAM paci. We lost both binkys temporarily and had to use a back up but she didn't like it. We found the other binkys and we are back on. Going to order more of the binks today.
After a month of life and being given only the breast or a pinky from her mom or dad....this is the ONLY binky our daughter will take. I love that it's all one piece and easily washable/sanitizable.
These are the only pacifiers I buys. They fit the baby's mouth well and I love that there's no &#34;up or down&#34; because its the same shape on both sides. Perfect for 2am binky hunts in the crib.
My 4 month old can get these binkies in and out of his mouth on his own due to the design. If he drops this one, he can find it and put it back in his mouth on his own. Worth every cent. Love these!
we have 4 of these and i wish they came in more gender neutral designs (i have 2 boys). they are the perfect size for both my toddler and my 4 yr old.  i also have the bowls which are great quality.
Adorable.  Arrived promptly.  The parents were very satisfied with them.  The baby girl took to them right away.  She cries if she drops it.  I have to laugh out loud.  Parents are avid Cowboy fans.
These are the only pacifiers both of my children will take. I love them. They are very soft and come in different sizes for different ages. The different colors are nice so we can tell whos is whos.
these are the best pacifiers out there--and worth the $$$--they don't fall apart, easy for my baby to find and pick up--can be doubled as a toy---great for car rides--and they look adorable to boot!
i bought these to go with my chocolate/kona organic ergobaby carrier for my daughter's drool problem. she loves sucking on them, they are resistant, easy to remove and wash. i highly recommend them.
so much better then pins! i've been using snappi's for almost 3 years and have only had 2 break out of the probably 10 we've had. we probably lose more then we break. that's why i got the neon ones!
Exactly what we needed and even better that it came in pink and purple for my baby girl!  I could only find all pink or all purple in stores and they were for 3+ months. I got what I needed here. :)
Who would have thought to attach a soothie pacifier to a stuffed animal!! Found these once at a local retail store and could not locate them again, anywhere. So glad we found on here. Great Product!
everyone that received  these gifts at my sisters shower loved them.  i thought the price was average and they gave the elegant touch i wanted for my sister's special day.  she felt like a princess.
Unfortunately these are no longer available in stores.  We had to buy them on Amazon and then have a friend bring them to us in New Zealand....but a parent will do anything to help a baby sleep.  :)
My lil breastfeed one didn't at allo like this pacy just like the other 3 different brands I purchased... I had high hopes but epic fail.  the paci is sturdy and made nice just not for my infant....
I bought these to keep my daughters lips from chapping. They are great for that. We had some previously that were open like this and they were great she just wore them and so these were replacements.
couldn't live without them and love that i can wash them too!  when my son lost his, we were using baggies like crazy.  i feel like i'm doing something good for the earth and they are convenient too.
Bought this for my newborn who is now 15 months old. This is now his &#34;soothie.&#34; He calls it his &#34;baby&#34; and it totally still comforts him. I buy these for all my expecting friends now.
My son love wubbanub pacifiers. I have three, but he seems to prefer his giraffes. He is nine months old, and he is able to find his pacifier when he loses it in his sleep in his crib pretty quickly.
my sister has this for her uppababy stroller and she loves it. i was looking for one myself, but unfortunately it didn't fit my jj cole broadway stroller -- the bar was too wide. sad to send it back.
my baby's pacifier kept falling out of his mouth in the car seat so i ordered this hoping to help keep it near his mouth for him to find when it does fall out. he loves it and it's worked well so far
These are more expensive but calming our little one makes it so worth it. These are the only ones she doesn't spit back out. I also like that it doesn't imprint on her face like the plastic ones did.
we've used these consistently with our cloth diaper regimen. they are great at the &#34;dirty job&#34; they are meant for. they are flushable, not rough to the touch and affordable. highly recommend.
Great small nipple for his tiny mouth. We tried a few different kinds of pacifiers, and these worked the best for our little man. The little handle on them also make it easier for him to grasp on to.
This is SUPER cute!!  I cannot wait to try it out on my little prince!  Even if he doesn't prefer the nipple shape, its still a cute baby item to display in his nursery!  Would recommend to a friend!
The pacifiers are great! The quality is excellent. My son uses his daily and unlike some other pacifiers we have used the logo has not faded.<br />Best of all everyone notices that he has team pride.
you just hook in on the Diaper bag and it keeps the pacifier handy or you can put a back up pacifier in it just in case you misplace the one the baby is using. I'm loving having the Pacifier Box.....
These are the best pacifiers I bought so far! They don't leave ugly marks on the kid's chubby little face! My lil princess can keep these in her mouth for hours! The adorable colors are a real bonus!
This is a wooden pacifier holder that is well made and absolutely adorable! I would definitely recommend this product to anyone with a baby or as a gift for the parent whose style is a bit more edgy!
My son loves his frog! I think almost every child has a comfort toy and this is his. I put it through the washer and dryer just about every week and so far (8 months later) it's holding up just fine.
this has been very comforting to us in trying to avoid an accident with our 1.5 year old.  we put this on our basement door to prevent her from getting access to the stairs.  will be purchasing more!
Have 4 month old twins and wubbanub's are all our babies have ever had.  We currently have 8 different ones.  4 for our daughter and 4 for our son!!!!  I'm sure we will buy more.  These are great!!!!
I bought this for my baby shower after searching for a long time. I just wanted something simple and this one was the perfect one. I got a lot of compliments and my mother approved. Im glad I got it.
Soothies are the best pacifiers in my opinion because the nipple is just like that of a bottle or mother. Both my daughters have used these now for their first few months of adjusting. Great product!
parents of the expectant boy were very pleased to get.  i'm sure i'll be reordering soon.  love the quality and the knit sheets fit well under the mattress corners and won't &#34;pop&#34; off easily.
Used these for cupcake toppers at a baby shower. Good quality so that mamma can actually use them later, and not so expensive that you have to break the bank to buy 12 of them. Exactly what I needed.
I was glad it came with the soothie pacifier since it's the only kind my 4 month old son likes to use. It's also very cute to see him hug his lion as he falls asleep. I highly recommend this product.
This seems to by my infants sons favorite pacifier - and the only one I don't seem to lose :) It's easy to find, when digging through the diaper bag, or spot, in the house. Love it. Highly recommend.
This is my daughter's favorite pacifier.  As an infant with limited motor control, the best part is that the animal body makes it more difficult for her to lose it or for it to fall out of her mouth.
And we like how they glow in the dark. Now that she is finding them and putting them back in her mouth, the glow in the dark feature comes in handy.They work best when left under a light for a while.
my 3mo old is not really into pacis or her thumb, but this is the only one that seems to soothe her and almost instantly put her to sleep. we are happy with the quality, and we recommend the product.
i've been using it for about 2 months. its almost completely silent and produces a good thick stream of moisture.  i like to have it mist into my face while working on computer to help with dry eyes.
Our grandson would not take any other pacifier except his &#34;Ellie&#34;!  We tried giving him the plain pacifier like it but he won't have anything to do with it.  He loves his &#34;Ellie&#34;. :-)
these are teh best pacifier creations ever my grandson now has 2 and he loves them , these will be great gifts for ppl having babies and such a variety to choose from. i will be purchasing many more.
Our little girl is two months old. We tried different kinds of pacifiers but she always had trouble holding them in her mouth until this one. No more worried about her pacifier falling out, so happy!
My kids always loved these as babies. If the pacifier always falls out of their mouth, but they still want it,  you can kinda prop the stuffed animal part against them to help hold it in their mouth.
I have two sons and took the heartbeat bear to hospital to soothe each of them from birth. They are now 6 and 12 years old and still fall asleep within minutes of hearing the soothing heartbeat sound.
i love this product.  great multi-use bag.  dirty clothes, dirty diapers, swim suits, make-up bag.  i'm never without this bag, need to order more.  i would recommend this product time and time again.
I never loose this pacifier cause it's attached to an animal. The baby never loses it cause it's tucked into his shirt which also keeps it in his mouth. Great product. Already recommended to everyone!
This is the only pacifier my daughter will use.  I specifically like that they are an orthodontic nipple and BPA free.  Size 3 are so hard to find in the local stores plus it's cheaper here on Amazon.
we bought these little guys and i love to squirt my son with these at bath-time. they're colorful, durable, and fun. half the time he's gnawing on them; it's easy to wash his hair while he's occupied.
My daughter kept spitting out her binky and would cry after a few moments without it.  The wubbanub helps the binky to stay in her mouth, and she loves cuddling with the little lamb.  Awesome product!
My grandaughter can't get enough of these pacifiers. She loves carrying them with a foot in her mouth, so her hands are free. They hold up well to daily washing. It's her go to toy when ready for bed.
Gave as a baby shower gift - Daddy was ecstatic; all the Bears fans present were miffed and we'll hear from the baby in the next few weeks!.  You can find just about anything on Amazon.com!  Awesome!!
my little one loves this night light. it's just enough light to soothe her and it has a 30 minute shut off timer which is very useful. i like it because it has led lights and it's one touch operation.
My baby grew out of his other pacifiers and started devloping a habit of wanting a bottle to go to sleep, so these pacifiers took the place of a bottle when he is laying in his crob and he loves them.
i loved it! it is pretty, and is white so can be for boy or girl. i love the night lite and that it has vibration and music. this is the best that i have seen and was definitly worth the money. <br />
my daughter is almost 2 now and i still love this car seat. she is still rear facing without difficulty. its nice to turn the car seat sideways to load her in. it fits nicely in my small, compact car.
my 2 year old loves this thing, it is way bigger than i thought it would be which was a bonus!  it lights up different colors only when in water, still don't understand how that works, but it is cool!
These are the only pacifiers my daughter will take. They are molded symmetrically鈥?so if she takes it out and puts it back in her mouth upside down, it is still the same shape, and she is still happy.
arrived as described. have had it for about a week and it's been great. i sprayed a little window cleaner on the suction cups before sticking them to the tub and so far no issues with it falling down.
it fits wonderfully on my baby trend jogger expedition lx.  i have yet to use it in the rain, but it appears that all important areas are completely covered with plastic and the velcro closes tightly.
purchased to go with a noah's ark nursery.  can't wait to put a photo of our 2 boys in it together.  very nice piece.  sturdily made. heavy (it is metal), but a great buy. definitely adds to the room.
This little lamb is so cute. It is my granddaughter's favorite pacifier, she loves holding it. It also comes apart so you can wash the lamb in the washer, which is nice cause it definitely gets dirty.
I purchased this because it was unique and my friend had put it on her list of wants for her baby shower.  She had put it on there as a funny gift, not really expecting to get it, but she was pleased.
This is the same pacifier we got at the hospital and it is the only one(brand) my new born likes(I've tried different brands)we only had one so we decided to order this package and we are glad we did!
Cute pacifier...everytime Xander wears this, everyone does a double take!  They always ask where I got this.  This is not only cute, but well made & is surprisingly my 9-month old's favorite pacifier!
So so so cute!!!!!!! I love these little things. I just hope that my baby will actually get to use them and that they are safe. So far so good because no one can use them yet. But they are SO so cute.
i like it! it served it's purpose. our baby was too small for the actual seat. the snugseat helps him stay up so that he is able to see everything when we go out for walks. he just turned four months.
My son loves this teether and chews it from all sides. It's easy to clean, doesn't have any places where water can get trapped, and can be run through the dishwater. I'd highly recommend this teether.
My daughter loves the caterpillar.  She can't wait to give it to my granddaughter.  The caterpillar design has sparked an entire theme of butterflies and caterpillars for my granddaughter's scrapbook.
this seat is great.  it adjusts easily, transports easily, and its easy to clean.  the great thing is that i know it will work well for a long time and i could probably even save for my own grandkids.
These are great. The one-piece design makes them easy to clean. My great-nephew is six months and they are still big enough and sturdy enough for him. He went for them right away and really likes them.
great for traveling, dining out ....fits almost everywhere even well made plastic tables. comes with a nice travel bag and set/breakdown is easy.....if we had this first, we would not need a high chair
Really love these binkies!!!  Used them with my second baby and also now with our third!!  The ring is a huge plus when carrying for baby and is also great for binkie clips!!  Baby loves them too!!  ;)
This has been the only pacifier my baby has used.  He loves it and uses it when he sleeps.  I like that it has a cover to keep it clean.  I clean it in soapy water and sterilize it in my Avent steamer.
most useful toy around the house, car... my baby loves it so much! bright colors, easy to assemble to anything. i even removed original toy from his bouncer and put this one, because he really loves it
my wife and i have an ez-cling sun shade in each of our cars. it works wonderfully for such a simple little device.<br /><br />it clings instantly to the car window and is very easy to move and center.
My daughter loves her bear! We also got her the dragon because who doesn't love GOT! She likes both, I'm sure we'll get more soon. The quality is great, pacifiers are sewn on good and animals are soft.
If your little one hasn't accepted any other pacifier then try this one! We thought we were doomed when we could get out little one to take a pacifier but decided to try one last time...she loves it!!!
Bought this for a shower present and I almost kept it in hopes of another grandbaby! These are loved by everyone that received them and the animals become the children's lovie far beyond the nuk years.
The giraffe with it's long neck seems to be the easiest for my baby to manipulate. She loves to have a pal to hold on to when she sleeps.  The shipping and price were competitive. I have no complaints.
Great product that becomes your child's go to pacifier. I've bought several over the years.  One even fell apart and the company stood behind their product and helped me to replace it. Thanks WubbaNub!
My baby wouldn't take any other pacifier but this one. I guess because of the shape. It was perfect. I got my first one from a friend and she said it was the only one that her baby took right away too.
My granddaughter would not take a pacifier but she liked the wubbanub and enjoyed chewing on it too. I have purchased them for baby gifts for friends too. You can't misplace it like a regular pacifier.
i have a 5 year old grand daughter and black leather seats,  which always had marks from her shoes...no more plus there is a place for her stuff.  i love them and so does my grand daughter.  thank you.
The stache's came on time and looked like the picture.  No complaints about the company.  The product was sticky enough to stay on, but don't change your facial expression as it will start to peel off.
My baby loves this product. It's easy for him to hold and manipulate. I like that it's easy to wash. I would suggest buying more than one. That way you can wash one and have one to use. Great product!!
my two kids use many products from thermos, and this is by far my favorite design! and of curse, all thermos we have work totally great without any complaints. that's why i keep getting more from them.
my 4 month old absolutely loves this!!! we have many toys for her and this one is our favorite! she can jump on her own vs not being able to scoot across the floor in the other toys yet. we love it!!!!
We are huge Wubba fans at our house. My son used this every day for the first 6 months of his life. He loved hanging onto the giraffe and playing with it while sucking on the pacifier. These are great.
Ive said it before, but we LOVE these pacifiers. Easy to find and hold and its a built in lovey. Got this one for a friend who just had a baby and hoping her daughter will love it as much as ours does.
These are great.  My twin girls love them, and they are easy for me to find in the middle of the night.  Hopefully they'll be able to find the pacis themselves in the middle of the night sometime soon!
these are just the best bibs. they're soft silicone, can be easily rinsed off after a meal and be washed in the dishwasher (top rack) anytime. there're easy to put on and have a hole to hang up to dry.
i am very pleased with this product, it cleans easily, easy to install, very durable, keeps the back seats clean from scuff marks. i'm also pleased with the built in pockets for organization ability. 馃槉
Wubba Nubs are the real deal.  We have ordered 8-10 of these from Amazon.  Our babies have loved them and cherished them.  They don't fall out and bounce and they can hold on to them.  Love the Wubbas!!
this is one of the best parenting tools when your child has a cold and a stuffy nose, but can't blow his nose for himself.  sounds gross, but it works fabulously and turns out not to be gross after all!
just got it and put it together, i love it!!! it's just like the picture but way cuter in person!!! it was easy to put together, can't wait for my son to use it!!! i know he'll love it when he's here ;)
This was the only pacifier that was the right size for our newborn.  She seemed to gag on the others once in a while; they were to big even though were size 0.  Good shape and fit and very cute designs.
My daughter lost hers while at a restaurant so we had to purchase a new one. She had a hard time going to sleep without her giraffe. Good thing we have prime so we only had to go without for a few days.
Love, love, love this lion wubbanub. It is so cute and the satin mane and satin tip on the tail are perfect for rubbing. We have already had the duck, frog and elephant and this is a welcome edition. :)
so happy about the glass option for avent bottles! we have been lucky not to drop one yet so i'm not sure if it will break easily but it seems pretty sturdy! wish it was easier to get a silicone sleeve.
soft, beautiful, cozy and a great purple!<br /><br />bought as a gift for my baby-to-be!!<br /><br />i definitely recommend this as a great blanket for kids! they love the softness and the silky border!
Purchased this cute little paci for my granddaughter.  Cutest thing ever....besides my granddaughter.  Definitely a must have for those cute babies.  The seller provided a great price and fast shipping.
this is a little pricey, but way cheaper than buying a new car that has ac vents in the back. i feel good knowing that when we get in the car & it's cold/hot my kids get collen's down/ warmed up faster.
My grandson won't sleep without his WubbaNubs. So Grandma purchased one for at her house and now he goes right to bed. The stuff animal makes it easy to find and it gives babies something to hold on to.
My daughter loves the wubbanub... The stuffed animal helps it stay in there month when they are first born and now that she is 4 months hold she holds on to it and plays with it. You should 100% get one
works perfectly for our 15 month old and she will continue to fit without the insert as she grows. straps attach it easily to a dining chair.  the storage of the tray under the chair is a great feature.
this medicine dispenser is ingenious. my baby approaches it like a bottle or pacifier and happily sucks down whatever i need to give her without fuss. no more messing with medicine syringes or droppers!
These are the type of pacifiers that my daughter likes and I thought the writing was funny.  I did see these for very cheap at Target a week or so after I bought them here but I'm still happy with them.
I use these for baby wreaths. Parents love em and they're great for teaching a baby to hold things at an early age. I've been told they help with bottle holding too and I just adored this little dragon.
This kitty is so cute. My son was rejecting all pacifier, then started taking this one when I offered it to him. he likes to hold on to it. I love that it helps keep the paci in his mouth and it's cute!
These were very cute and well-made.  My son still never took a paci - he just looked up at me like, &#34;where's the milk, mom?&#34;  Overall though as a product these are adorable and well-made though.
I purchased the Womb Bear for my new granddaughter.  She loves it!  It helps her relax when she is crying.  It also has a velcro fastener to attach to the crib which is excellent.  A Must for a Newborn!
This is the only pacifier that my baby will use, of the 20 or so that I've tried. It gives great peace of mind knowing the pacifier 'is all one piece', eliminating the fear of bubs breaking of the teet.
my 10 month old loves these, i stack them and she knocks them down and gets very excited. they are a hard rubbery material so she enjoys &#34;chewing&#34; on them as well. very happy with this purchase!
Its like a nipple. Obviously he is gonna like it better than the other cheap plastic ones. Doesn't stay in his mouth very well though and you can see them sucking on it through the hole its kinda funny.
These are my son's favorite pacifiers.  He loves how they feel in his mouth and the silicone is very soft.  I do with that they weren't quite so clear - sometimes it's hard to find where he throws them.
perfect.  my twin sons have slept 10-11 hrs a night since week 10 and i largely attribute it to the halo sleepsack.  although the larger sized do not swaddle, my boys prefer the sleeveless option anyway.
I like this ....well not me so much as my son.  Got this one at the Hospital and threw away all the ones I bought before he was born.  I bought this one as a spare just in case the hospital one got lost.
I am very satisfied with the product.  It is just a shame that the only place a person could find this product was threw Amazon.  It is a very sturdy product. What more can you say?  It works, thank God.
Only thing that matters is my grand daughter is extremely attached (literally) to her &#34;puppy&#34; and when the tattered original went missing time was of the essence. Thanks for your speedy delivery.
My daughter loves the wubbanub so much that we bought another one just for her to have at daycare!  Her little hands can grasp the elephants ears and it really helps the paci to stay in her mouth easier!
These are the only pacifiers my 3 1/2 month old son likes (been using them since he was 2 weeks). Good price and easy to clean, the clear ones can be hard to locate though sometimes once I put them down.
i love this pillow!  its shaped well and firm with a touch of softness from the foam.  and the height is the best i can find for a little toddler.  would definitely buy again and recommend to my friends.
pushes easy. much upgrades since older models, fits key fit 30 chicco. padded seats, better buckles, 3 year old loves it! great product, swivel wheel is a must, spend the extra. folds good to fit in van.
love these sheets.  the big selling point is that the flat sheet has a small fitted seat section at the bottom of the sheet.  it really helps it stay on when those tossing toddlers are fighting bed time.
this tote bag totally spoke to my sense of humor. it is exactly as pictured,straps are sewn on with lots of stitching, but would not put too many heavy objects in it. makes me want school to get started!
If you want to get sleep buy this. No more searching in the night for the paci. You have to have it for a newborn... It is seriously the sweetest pacifier around. My daughter loves them. I have 3 of them
my son had not used a straw before this cup. we started using it when he was 16 months. he quickly figured it out!!  we only use water in it since anything else would seem hard to clean out of the straw.
i am so pleased these work with my medela pump. i was looking for the soft flanges and didn't find them but somehow came across these and they work great! i think the size is more based on your cup size.
I brought these for my grandson. I guess its a matter of preference. He likes them over the other ones his mom brought. They are small enough to fill his mouth without him straining to get a grasp on it.
This product looks hillarious on my son though I would only use it for taking pictures and such. He really doesn't like the shape of the nipple itself though I've seen some other children like however :)
Sent this as a &#34;gonna be a new mommy&#34; gift. She said it is beautiful. Would recommend for someone you are not sure what to get for them, but want to send something that will be treasured forever.
With my daughter I had to get up in the middle of the night when she couldn't find her nuks.  My son finds his own.  I put them up to the light right before bed and it glows most the night.  Much easier!
bought this for my granddaughter and she has a blast in it. plus there are lots of places to attach toys so she can't drop them.  added bonus the ones we hung she crawls over to a plays with on her back.
my son absolutely loves this.  It is the only pacifier he will use.  He uses it as something to cuddle with.  Only problem is he won't take any other pacifiers and we have to bring this everywhere we go.
My daughter uses it, ask her. But you'll have to wait a while she can't talk. It's pacifier people it is what it is. Quality is good and the soother is just like the ones you take home from the hospital.
My Son Loved this item! He was not a paci baby, and I wanted to have one thing that he would enjoy to give me a little time... well this was it! The alligator shape was great too, easy for him to handle.
This is the only pacifier my 3 month-old can keep in her mouth for longer than a few seconds. It's curved shape fits around her mouth perfectly, and it's a lot lighter than other pacifiers. Good product.
I got these for my new grandson, who is a pacifier baby with pretty good hand control at four months (just!) and we all love them.  I am buying more to have around to give as gifts--my son-in-law's idea!
MAM is the best pacifier out there for breast fed babies! I have purchased MANY of these with having 3 kids. They each take/took them well. Now I give them to expecting moms as part of their shower gift.
My daughter loved these binkies.  It is like a toy and binky all in one.  She was able to grasp thing faster.  She might not had the binky part all the time but she would grab the cat toy with her hands.
My daughter loved these binkies.  It is like a toy and binky all in one.  She was able to grasp thing faster.  She might not had the binky part all the time but she would grab the cow toy with her hands.
when i opened these i expected a strong plastic smell... nope!!!! they smell like coconut / the beach!!!  great colors & shapes!!! can hardly wait for my little one to be big enough to play with them!!!!
this cover fits perfectly over the svan toddler chair. it's easy to put on and take off--easy to spot clean. it fits snug on the chair and doesn't slip around at all. a great purchase to go with the chair
My daughter saw a friend had a collection of these so being a toddler she also must have one.  She loves it & wants to take it everywhere but it's small can can easily be lost or misplaced (like we have).
worked great for a long drive for my 12 month old.  size is perfect.  both sides work well, i did not think that the non fuzzy side was too scratchy.  i will continue to use it for our commute to daycare.
i bought the long and two short guard rail covers and am very happy with my purchase.  it is a great buy, fits well and my baby is putting it to the test with his teeth and the covers are holding up well!
My baby loves these bottles, I do too. I love the design, easy to clean. The mam gift sets are always cheaper,this is my 3rd set. I wanted the monkey set but got the otters set,  that's my only complaint.
we previously borrowed this stroller from a friend for a trip to chicago with two grandkids... it was fabulous for the airport and the zoo... plenty of space for the two of them with a little storage too.
This is the perfect pacifier holder. Our daughter uses the Sassy MAM pacifiers and we are able to fit two in this holder. It keeps them clean and makes it easy to find a paci when you need one! Great buy!
Not sure why..... But these are the only Paci's my son loves.  Now that he is 7 months, he can easily hold onto them because of the openings on the side. This is key!  (Read: he doesn't need Mommy 24/7!!)
Super cute and very convinient.  Hard to lose. My two month old  baby loves it . He loves to play with the dinosaur while he is sucking on the pacifier.  Sometimes he falls asleep holding it.  I love it!!
love it!!  a lil small but worth it for me. fast delivery n like how it has four lil silver things on the bottom so the bag will stand up instead of falling over. has pockets inside as well as the outside
this was a great toy for my two granddaughters.  it's just the right size for their little hands and \\grabs\\ their attention with the flashing lights and variety of music. the price was very reasonable.
This is awsome!  i really like the little dragon, baby likes it too, it stays in place for the most part as long as she doesn't grab it, but if she falls asleep, it stays right there in case she wakes up.
Everyone who sees my 2 yr old daughter with this thinks it's cute and funny. My daughter even looks in the mirror and laughs. She loves it n so do i, perfect fit for her. The pacifier is not heavy at all.
Gift recipient had this on her wish list which made it an easy buy.  Product seems to be on a lot of mother's shower lists.  If they don't this would make an excellent choice if you're searching for ideas
I don't know why by my daughter loves these, and only these.  I do have to say that compared to some other pacifiers these are odorless.  Quite a few others we tried smelt like rubber, even after boiling.
These pacifiers are great.<br />Well made, rubbery.<br />My granddaughter loves them.<br />easy to clean.<br />I just wish they glowed in the dark..not easy to find if lost..lol<br />Would buy these again
These pacifiers are the only ones my baby will take. They are thin and flexible so presumably will not affect her teeth coming in. Plus they come in really nice designs. I would buy these again and again!
This a great pacifier. It doesn't leave a red ring on babies face like sine others do. It's great for babies who like to chew on there binkys. My little guy loves this one. My sister in law uses them too.
my granddaughter loves it.  makes managing her pacifier so much easier.  She can get it back in place by herself and loves playing<br />with the legs of the caterpillar.  It is even cuter than the picture.
my son has really enjoyed this. people say they like the necklace and are usually very surprised to find that it's also a teething toy. we've been using it for a few months now and it has no signs of wear.
Great for kids soothing I will recommend to new moms specially for babies this is great for the middle of the night so you won't have to be searching for the pacifier in the dark this will hold and stay in
I so wish our baby would take one of the cute pacifiers out there, but after trying dozens this was the only one he would take! Thankful we found a binary he lives, but wish it wasn't so obnoxious looking!
Basically get one free when buying these through amazon, our baby wants nothing to do with most pacifiers except for this style, so we like to keep a bit of a stock pile and for this price it's not too bad
Since my grandson will eventually be using the Advent bottles, I purchased the advent pacifiers. Love the fact you are able to put your finger  in the pacifier's center so the baby can suck on your finger.
These pink soothies appear to be a little firmer than the green ones that we have both gotten at the hospital and online. It's nice to have something a little prettier than the green for your little girls!
My baby LOVES LOVES LOVES his WubbaNub. I actually got two for him (frog and elephant). He enjoys being able to cuddle with the stuffed animal while soothing himself to sleep with the pacifier. BRILLIANT!!
These are the kind of pacifiers that come from the hospital so it's nice to have some extra's handy. Plus it's nice to not have to worry if the baby will like a different one because they are all the same.
very good<br />product, all seven pieces just as described in photos ,<br />Nice big box ,arrived intact. Very nice quality of fabric, and high quality teddy bear- very soft. Overall- good value for money!
My son is 2.5 and still has to have these everynight.  SO 5 stars it is these put him to bed peacefully everynight..... I know we are needing to get rid of them I just dread the day we dont have them. lol.
my son loves these pacifier, i wish they were a little cheaper but i like that they are silicone and not hard or in different pieces. my sone enjoys sucking on this pacifier and chewing on it for teething.
got one as a gift and my daughter loved them so much, i bought two others.  they are truly comfortable and work as a little easy swaddler for older kids.  wish i'd had them with my first child!  love them!
we purchased these for wrestling pins for &#34;pins&#34; for a pin. they were very nice quality and arrived on time. they got held up by the weather delays in shipment but the vendor had sent them on time.
This thing is ridiculously cute and so soft.  The size is great for it's intended recipient- a niece that's turning three soon.  It seems pretty well made, too.  I'm honestly tempted to buy one for myself.
This was part of a donation that I gave to a therapy dog cause.  Hoping it helps the owners adjust to the way-too-early loss of their beloved Stacey Mae and the joy of their lovely little puppy, Kasey Mae!
i bought this for my first grandchild and he and his mother love it. she told me she doesn't know what she'd do without it. he is 15 months now and has to use it every night. i'm so happy that we found it.
very well made and sturdy!  i got this for my visiting grandson, so it will be perfect to grow with him, from high chair to booster seat.  the colors are very nice too - neutral enough to go with anything.
i purchased a dr.seuss outfit for babys first birthday as his party theme. was dr.seuss.he weighs 25 lbs so i took 24 months.he had a little bit room.he looked adorable.i purchased on amazon. very pleased.
This is a great rattle! It's pretty large as far as rattles go and makes a nice rattle sound when shaken. My 5 month old has a hard time holding it because it's on the thick side, but he will grow into it.
surprisingly sturdy.  from the looks of the picture this bed looks like it will fall to pieces when an adult sits on it, but it's pretty sturdy.  was very easy to put together (much easier with two people).
This is our second of this one so we have it for home and daycare. My daughter never took a paci but she liked to hold the lamb and now that she's teething she chews on the pacifier.  It's her favorite toy.
my 16 month old daughter loves the monkey, but loves her buttercup doll (same brand) even more.  the monkey is a little large for her right now but the arms and legs make it easy for her to carry it around.
love these bibs because they clean easy, wipe right off for several uses and then throw in the washer later. best of all, they're soft & fit snuggly around baby's neck to actually serve the purpose of a bib
love it. spacious. isn't air airtight but don't think it claims to be. use for chips and snacks in my daughter's school lunches. or non juicy fruit. i wash w soap and water and dry in dish rack. very happy.
Best baby product ever. The weight of the animal keeps the pacifier closer to my baby's mouth during sleep. She loves clutching the animal and holding it herself鈥攁 good item to help with basic motor skills.
my daughter moved to this stage of the nipples fast. she isn't frustrated that she isn't getting her milk fast enough. we have bought these nipples in slow, medium and fast - no complaints with any of them.
My girlfriend and I love the whole fake mustache trend and this is almost as funny looking as the baby pacifier with a mustache. They work great for identifying your drink at a party too. Highly recommended
summer infant swaddleme sacks are my favorite sleep sacks because they zip form the bottom up. you never have to fit the two sides of the zipper together, which makes putting the sack on the baby very easy.
Works great.  The slight amount of weight helps keep it in his mouth, and now he likes holding onto the stuffed animal while he is sucking on the pacifier.  The only down side is trying to clean everything.
I love this product. My son will only take a soothie pacifier but he has a hard time keeping it in on his own. This solved that problem. Now he even holds onto it and pets the puppy as he's falling asleep:)
This produst met my expectations. It was used for a gift for my friends babyshower and she loved it. The sparkles are so cute :) I would recommend this. And will be buying this again for another babyshower.
i keep this on the main level of my house (my daughters bedroom is upstairs, and so is her changing table) so this works perfect for livingroom diaper changes. it's also really easy to wipe off when needed!
this is our second sleeper w have purchased after my son outgrew his first one. definitely a product i can't live without. i never have to worry about him getting cold during the night or coming unswaddled.
this is he best. it really helps prevent flathead on newborn babies. i bought this when our infant was four months old. i wish i had known about the noggin earlier. every home with a newborn should own one.
These are my son's favorite pacifiers! He is 2 now, and this is the brand he has liked since he was a newborn.  They're really cute and they hold up to boiling well, if only we could keep from loosing them!
excellent mattress pad. it is really thick and soft when put on and of course it protects the mattress itself from stains. so i would presume this is a win-win. :) overall, great product and quick delivery.
i needed a gift for my niece who is expecting twin girls.  these soft little dolls will be perfect crib-mates for the new babies.  very soft, colorful, and just the right size.  very happy with these dolls!
These are our favorites. The gumdrops are cuter but my baby always seems to shift them around in his mouth. It's nice and easy that these are round. Every baby is different but these ones work great for us.
These work great! I bought the neutral print and the little boy print and both are very cute! They don't leak and the small pouch is definetly just for pacifiers or something tiny... worth the money though!
My daughter LOVES these pacifiers.  She will not touch any other pacifier I have offered her.  These are also the same pacifiers that I received from our closest children's hospital!  Highly recommend them!
My baby seems to love this one better than others. Maybe because of its orthodontic nipple design. It also stays in his mouth longer his other pacifiers. He gets many compliments for his &#34;mustache.&#34;
bought this for my first grandson, i had bought his furniture at pottery barn kids (expensive) but got the mattress here.  he is 3 months old and the mattress is wonderful.  reasonable priced and well made.
love this banana. 6 month old won't take any pacifier or anything but he took the banana! perfect size for baby and looks like toothbrush end really soothes his teeth/ gums. i do not leave home without now.
After trying every brand out there, we are a committed MAM family.  I love them because she loves them, but even more, she uses the outside when teething.  I love a product that serves more than one purpose!
i love how easy it is and how attractive it is. i use it outside under our covered veranda. it matches our iron railing so well! it's a great safety feature that looks like it just fits in perfectly!!! great
We love all our wubbanubs - we throw 4 in my 8 month old's crib every night so he can find them when he needs them. He learned to put them back in his mouth himself before he could put a regular pacifier in.
We love all our wubbanubs - we throw 4 in my 8 month old's crib every night so he can find them when he needs them. He learned to put them back in his mouth himself before he could put a regular pacifier in.
Our baby girl (now 2) loved her caterpillar wubbanub and it made it easier for her to find and hold her pacifier at a young age. Recently purchased Ella Bella the Elephant for our newborn.  Beautiful colors.
Starting using this kind of pacifier with my son 4 years ago and we decided to use them for our second since we never had complaints. Designs on them are wonderful and very durable. My kids teeth are perfect
this is my second set of bumkin bibs. i love how they are easy to use and wash. you can toss them into the washer and get them extra clean. i've accidentally thrown them in the dryer before and they're fine.
This Boston Red Sox Baby Set was such a delight to give as a gift. The whole set is very cute and hard to find in stores. I am very pleased with the whole set and will be back when we need another baby gift.
i love this product and i will like to purchase more of it very soon. the cover fits my baby mattress although its a little losse, it is still good for my mini mattress  and fits find. the material is great.
great product. It helps my situation. I have a daycare and infants when they are really young they do not know how to hold anything yet but the little toys with it will at least hold it in place for a while.
These apparently are the only pacifiers my daughter will take and keep in her mouth. Everything else she spits out, even the silicone ones of the same brand. Wish there was more latex selection in Mam brand.
The only passy my daughter will take. These are amazing and we have them all over the house. These helped ween her from the middle of the night feeding. She learned to soothe herself with this passy instead.
the calendar was just what i was looking for. there was a place to put your own pics for each month and the day spaces were big enough to write in.  was very happy it came in a plastic sleeve to store it in.
purchased this as a gift for my friends one year old son. item arrived much quicker than i expected, exactly as listed, and is a huge hit with the baby. definitely recommend this product for 12months and up.
this has been a great bag for us. the colors are neutral and not too girly or too manly. the compartments are varied and useful. it has held up pretty well for the past year that we have used it. we love it.
This bear is adorable!! I got this for my expecting niece and brought. A smile :) it may or may not work for her newborn.. But is neat and makes a great baby shower gift!! Love it and the idea behind it!! :)
i love this sponge. it is very affordable, cute, and fits perfect in my safety first tub. i highly recommend this. with out last child, we used a sponge and it has made bath time with a newborn much happier.
we love the photo memories we have because of our sticky bellies monthly stickers. it's also a great gift to give at showers or at the hospital when visiting a new mom. they fit right inside a card envelope!
These have lasted forever!! They are all one piece so you don't have to worry about them falling apart and being inhaled or swallowed. Easy to clean and disinfect. My daughter keeps hers around at all times.
this bottle warmer works great. i love the fact that it is very easy to operate, warms bottle very fast and evenly. i also like the fact that you can sanitize pacifiers. it doesnt really take much time to do
i bought this for my son and daughter-in-law and my new grandson.  the picture is amazing--especially at night.  the night vision image is as clear a s a bell.  would recommend to anyone for baby shower gift
i love these diapers for nighttime.  they usually don't leak until morning after a 12 hour night, if at all.  i use one of the microfiber inserts that came with the diaper and 2 or 3 hemp inserts under that.
santa brought my grandbaby a bumbo seat to nannan's house and we love it. i can set her on the large island in my kitchen while i cook. i am still within arm reach from her. the tray is a great play station.
My 3 day old granddaughter came a little early - 36 weeks, 5 lb 12 oz - and she would just gag on any other pacifier.  The lamb is really cute and it helps keep the pacifier in her mouth.  Highly recommended.
i've had this before. works well on a smooth surface. gives me balance control when my eyes are shut. no good for  holding you up. it's not meant for that. a good way to find out where to put a permanent one.
So darn cute!  Received them so quickly and they are packaged nicely.  Can't wait to give to to my cousin who is having a baby shower in a few weeks.  Looks like quality materials.  Nice cap cover for nipple.
i purchased this for my 2.5 year old for traveling and he loves it. it folds up so small and takes up little space in the car. when unfolded, it's a comfortable place for my toddler to nap and sleep at night.
very secure, and not too unattractive. i thought we could skip over having one of these things or find something less obtrusive, but knowing what i now know, i wouldn't. just get this one and be done with it.
good thick sturdy fabric i use this wet bag for weekend trips with one babe. fits about 15 diapers and maintains its shape standing up. i would recommend kanga care wet bags and their rumparooz diaper covers.
These little guys are the best. My babies loved them and the animal is not only cute, but useful as it lets smaller babies hold the pacifier in place long before they would be able to with a regular pacifier.
it is so nice for my 4 year old to be able to get in and out on her own. we did have to buy a shoulder pad for the seatbelt, but as you can find them here on amazon for around $5, it's not that big of a deal.
My grandson won't take a pacifier no matter how many different kinds we've tried.<br />But this product is great. Just as promised and lightning fast delivery. It's not their fault the kid won't take it, LOL!
i am quite satisfied with this car seat. easy to install, easy to use, the colors are pleasant. i am using this seat forward facing. my daughter loves it, and so do i. i would recommend this seat to a friend.
My baby girl loves her wabbanub, out of all the pacifiers I tried this one is her favorite...she has been sucking on it since she was a week old and now at 3 months she plays with the giraffe more and more...
a little gross to think about but it works so well on my two week old as well as on my 20 month old, plus after reading about the inevitable mold that grows in classic bulb syringe, i had to give this a shot.
So cute!  I bought this for a friend's baby boy.  He really loves holding the giraffe while using the pacifier.  And, his Mom says she can cut the pacifier off when he gets older and keep the stuffed giraffe.
Closest I can find to the old 60s-80s pacifiers, to use for authentic vintage clothing and accessories for doll collection.  They're sturdy, and have the non-orthodontic nipple (slightly 'bulbed' at the end).
The only bottles my breast fed baby will take! I love them and they come apart nicely to clean. It's great that you get two different sized bottles and two different sized nipples (size 1 and 2) with the set.
This was exactly what I was looking for when I was looking for a pacifier holder. I also like that it clips on to the outside of bags, so it's easy to access when you have a screaming baby. Also fits 2 binks!
This is the pacifier that they gave my daughter at the hospital, and she loves it. They last forever, my older daughter also used this kind, and they are fairly big so they are easy to find in the crib at 2am.
I bought two of these pacifiers for a friend's Baby Shower. She LOVED them! I think one might be used on the husband... O_o<br /><br />The items arrived swiftly after purchasing them.<br /><br />GREAT quality!
My son loves these! I had gotten the I love daddy ones at the store and was so excited to see the had the I love mommy ones too!! Now we secretly slip one or the other in his mouth as a friendly competition!!!
these are super cute.  the colours are neutral and i can see getting wear out of them because they will match different outfits.  not sure if the baby will love them as much because they aren't bright colours.
These are my daughters favorite. I thought they looked strange at first but got used to them. She loves them! Great quality. They hold up better than any other brand and we've tried every orthodontic pacifier.
This bag is the perfect size. I was a bit concerned when I saw it was drawstring, but I haven't had any problems. I just toss it in my diaper bag and throw anything that gets messy in it until I get back home.
My son loves this teddy. It puts him to sleep and soothes him. It also helps him stay in a deep sleep. Sometimes if I shut it off too soon he will wake up instantly and cry. Best $20 I've spent in a while!!!!!
these are my favorite bibs for the &#34;drooly months.&#34; no velcro to mess with your other laundry or irritate baby's skin. ten of them seemed like a lot at first, but then there's always a clean one handy.
we started using this bathtub the third week after our daughters birth. we finally had to get a bigger tub because she out grew it. it's absolutely adorable and easy to use. the three adjustments were perfect.
My baby loved these!  And I loved them since they are super easy to wash.  My baby has now moved onto the Avent paci's and with the Avents, water can sometimes get trapped in the nipples whereas, these do not.
This thing changed my baby's sleeping life!  He could finally get back to sleep on his own in his bed or in his car seat once I gave him this WubbaNub that he could easily find and get to his mouth on his own.
My son uses this pacifier daily. The skull has NOT rubbed off like some of the other reviews stated and I wash it several times a day so I would say it's good quality. The nipple is similar to a Nuk pacifiers.
purchased this before our baby was born in fall 2013 despite mixed reviews. after 17mos of use it is still in excellent shape and the lightweight feature makes changing sheets so much easier. highly recommend!
absolutely perfect! we got this for my one year old daughter for her first birthday and she loves it so much we bought a second one for our almost four year old really durable would recommend to other mothers!
This is my second beco. I had a butterfly2 but i didnt like all of the buckles. I love this one and so does my baby. The pattern is super cute and i get lots of compliments on it. its nicely padded everywhere.
And because these are made from a single piece of rubber, no dirt accumulates anywhere on the paci. And because there're no plastic parts, when the kid rolls over one in sleep, it doesn't hurt and wake him up.
this toy is amazing. i've never seen a hand boiler before. i bought this for my 10 year old daughter. i think i'll play with it more than she will! it's very educational if you look into how it works. love it.
this is a great product for just children who are just starting to teeth. it is just big enough to fit in their mouths so they can chew on it! it almost looks like a pacifier when they have it in their mouths!
I'm a NICU nurse, and these are great!  I always buy them for my friends when they have a baby, and people rave about the fact that it keeps the pacifier in the mouth, or at least off the ground!  I love them.
We were on the hunt for these..couldn't find them anywhere at the normal baby stores.. our son would only use this brand/design. Luckily there's amazon!!!<br /><br />Now we have a bunch and he's never without!
My baby tried so many pacifiers, and this one is his favorite!! And it's so easy to wash it! I was so exited that I've found it on Amazon, cause every store I check, they only have 0-3 mths. Only Amazon has 3+
i was so excited when i saw this at my sisters that i decided to get one too. i love lion king so i thought this would be perfect for my little one. i wish it did come with a remote, but i can live without it.
We lost our sons first and only one of this wubbanub at Disney and we were devastated! Found this one and ordered right away! It shipped so fast and got to us even faster!! Our son was so happy and so were we!
I saw a little boy with one of these and had to order one for my son. It's so cute when you look at it, and when my son is using it, even cuter! Many variations to choose from but I chose the doggie! Well made!
As soon as I put it in his mouth he grabbed into it! He's been sleeping with it all through nap time today. I thought it had a clip to change soothies out but it doesn't. O well still so sweet and works well.:)
great little kick mat for the price. we bought a tummy time mat as well. the price for both was still cheaper than a dual purpose mat. the tummy time also fits folded up inside of this mat when it is zipped up.
These are the only pacifiers my baby will use.  Over this last year, we have brought over 10 packs.  They are of excellent quality but the baby likes to make them disappear, so we like having plenty of back up.
I've read that these don't cause nipple confusion for an EBF baby. We waited a month before introducing artificial nipples and this seems to hold true! I also like that they are all one piece and easy to clean.
My 7 month-old daughter loves this pacifier. She also uses it as a teether. She chews it from both sides. It's safe and very soft, she can't hit herself with it, or get hurt when she rolls over it while asleep.
love the cover and the color. my son keeps grabbing at the material while feeding, and it's a bit hot (in a hot and humid climate like singapore) but i have remained covered and can see what's going on beneath.
love it! works wonders! so cute on my little man! read some other reviews... do not let your child chew on the necklace! the amber reduces swelling just by touching their skin - it is not meant to be chewed on.
FINALLY!!! This is THE paci we got at the hospital. It isn't available in any store I have been to. It's not the &#34;gumdrop&#34; marketed brand found at babies r us or other big retailers online or otherwise.
very cute and decent sized (about the size of a football). i bought this for my 2.5 year old for christmas because it is a simple, traditional design without any messy glitter or glued on pieces to be an issue.
Fits 2 Soothie pacifiers perfectly. At first my husband didn't like the extra bag but it truly does make finding a pacifer in a hurry easier. And the fact that it snaps means we can quickly switch between bags.
We bought this for our son's family it is a vemry good conversation piece and it makes you laugh and that makes the baby laugh! This would work great for thank you cards with the baby picture! Imagine that! Lol
Certainly is useful to be able to tuck in to keep the pacifier from disappearing... take note that the pacifier is bonded into the critter, so that it can not be changed or separated from the plush toy portion.
very lightweight. my daughter is really picky about pacifiers.. the MAM pacifiers and soothies have been the only ones I could get to work.. finally a pacifier I can use to attach to her so it doesn't get lost!
My daughter loves these pacifiers won't take any other kind. She snuggles the stuffed animal when sleeping and holds their hands while awake and playing or driving in the car. My recommendation to all new moms.
well, the whales &#34;have it!&#34;  my one month old granddaughter sleeps like a baby (haha!) while the whales are singing!  as soon as it is turned off, she wakes up until it is turned back on!  a must have!!
The best pacifier ever! They are great for the itty bitty ones. I can prop them on the babies belly and they can find them much eaisier that way. Then when baby gets older they can find them better in the crib.
As a baby my daughter did not care for the plush attached to her binky. Now that she is older (&#62;1 year) she adores it! And it makes it easy to spot the binky even in the dark! Now to get it away from her...
Cute, streamlined, gets the job done. Since I only paid six dollars, it gets all five stars!  I do have to be careful if diapers are sopping wet, but it can handle my son's usual heavily damp diapers just fine.
this was a great addition on top of the wood floor in our playroom. as she got bigger we made different combinations. i even made cubes with them. easy to wipe and wash and soak in the sink for deeper cleaning.
this organizer was a lifesaver on a recent road trip! i was driving cross country alone with my daughter, so i needed something to keep her &#34;stuff&#34; organized and easy to reach. i won't travel without it!
At first glance you may think these pacifiers look a little goofy, but they're great protection against chapped lips.  MAM brand over any other was a lifesaver for our family.  My son is totally soothed by them.
My baby and I both love these pacifiers!!<br />They're guilt free for me since they don't have strange chemicals, like pthalates, etc. And my baby gets giddy every time he sees it. So I guess it's a perfect fit!
These are my son's preferred pacifier. We don't use a pacifier often, but it better be one of these when we do! Also, they are the most similar to the pacifier that he was given at the hospital when he was born.
Our little guy is not a fan of any old pacifier, but he sure likes these! I like the natural product for him, and the texture is great when they start to gum and teeth too. Ordered their teether for that reason!
Our little one loves his wannanub.  I was a gift and I ordered a second one to have in case we lost the first one.  I tried the elephant, but he likes the frog a lot more.  He likes to chew on the legs and feet!
fits the secure beginning's mattress perfectly and is very easy to put together.  the crib is very rugged although there is one board that supports the mattress that they leave raw wood and could use some stain.
They work great for me! Granted you can't be in the darkest room in the house to see them but then you also can't see your baby! But if you have even the smallest bit of light for your baby then these will glow!
my son was having meltdowns every time we had to put him in the back of the car. this helped relax him and worked wonders! he has learned to push the buttons himself now and he loves hearing the changing sounds.
this is great in taking things you need on the go. i like the black color because you can't see it when it gets stained. plus it hold your bottle, containers of food in place. i am recommending this to everyone.
Mainly bought these because my daughter's husband and my son's wife are Patriots fans.  They're nicely made and just a typical pacifier.  If you're a fan and want a novel item for the baby, this is cute to have.
i have twin baby grandchildren and these really fit the bill.  they cover everything and have a velcro closure  at the back of the neck.  their arms slip through so shoulders are covered....this bib really works
Love these pacifiers! This is my second baby and I wish I had these when my daughter was born- the are great! Glad my baby boy loves them as much as we love seeing him use it! GO RED SOX- World Series champs !!!
worked great.  created one for our new puppy and one for my 6 & 8 yr old daughters. after reading the reviews about cracking i decided to place a damp paper towel on it as it began to dry.  it is drying perfect!
I absoluteness love this item wubbanubs are the best. I got my daughter hers back in 07 and she used it everyday. This purchase is for a friend and I can not wait to give it to her. The shipping was fast also!!!
We had a baby that hated pacifiers and wanted to nurse nonstop for comfort we purchased these for a trial and they worked wonders, I love the design for our baby girl and am so happy to have something that works
My favorite type of paci to get for my babies.  They like latex because they also nurse and it feels more like skin. Silicone is too plasticky, so I always get latex. My kids wouldn't even take a different paci.
My 10 month old daughter loves this.  We used it with frozen fruit so far and she did not want to put it down.  The cap is nice for if she doesn't finish, but so far she hasn't had any leftovers.  Great product!
my 9 month old loves this. she loves it so much that she will hold still for me while i change her diaper if she's holding it. it basically doubles as a teether. the design prevents choking. what a great product.
we absolutely love this stroller! it took me 5 minutes to put it together. it's really used friendly, doesn't take up a lot of room and it rides smoothly! a friend encouraged me to get it and i'm so glad she did!
installs easy - yes, there is a seemingly large gap until you tighten it up but once you get one set can get others arranged quickly.  easy to set up multiple gates around the house and create pet friendly zones.
Our kids with small children are in the computer field, so they loved it but more importantly, they work. Put it in or give it to them and they go mute, pull it out and they sound the alarm. What more could I day
we have two of these that are washed with the diaper load, so one is always clean.  we have been using them about 6 months with no problems.  they go in the hot wash inside out, then hang to dry with the diapers.
This little giraffe is just adorable. I make sure this goes in the car with us. It's much harder for my little guy to loose it during our travels. The giraffe  is soft and snugly. Perfect for little hands to hug.
Know a new parent that is a Sox fan? I do and what better thing to get him. It's different from the typical baby gifts. Quality made and safe for babies. Help your friend indoctrinate the little sports fan early!
my kudos love using this pillow when they are &#34;camping&#34; in their blanket forts! it is small and easy to move from place to place and has retained its fullness over the course of several months. thank you!
Got this for my daughter and nephew and love it. It's so cute! It also makes it nice if you have a toddler who likes to help with baby; teach him/her to grab animal to stick binky in baby's mouth. It's a win win.
We  have a large family with lots of grandkids and their associated messes. When the baby starts to get fussy, this is so much easier to locate and it stays in juniors mouth better with the extra paws holding on.
My son loves wubbanubs! They are just big enough that he actually will hug them and holds them in place. Plus their extra size makes it easy to find (even in the middle of the night or at the bottom of the purse)
I'm not sure how I got by without these.  Consider this one slightly smaller and lighter than the 4 legged ones available.  My son went for this turtle first when he was 8 months due to the smaller, compact size.
These are the ONLY pacifiers my daugter will take. The glow in the dark kind is very convenient. They start to wear out a little after about 2 months, but they are definitely worth it and we will continue to buy.
these maymom pump valves came quickly. they are the same as the ones used for avent's original breast pump only better. these seen to be made of a heavier more durable material. i am hoping they will last longer.
I love these binkys! When my baby's come home from the hospital they get one from the hospital. So I needed to buy some for the next baby. Just in case I lose the one from the hospital! The price is even great!!!
the front comes up high enough that they aren't peeing out. easy to clean and cute! this is gross, but i got my son to poop on it by telling him that frogs eat poop and the frog was hungry. whatever works, right?
This is a wonderful and fun way to keep track of your baby's paci.  My daughter is not really a paci baby but she does love her monkey.  It also makes it easy for little ones to find their paci while in the crib.
Everything was perfect until they arrived. The only complaint I have is the color. I know it says colors may vary but I purchased for a boy and both were pink. I was hoping to get at least one suitable for a boy.
my 2 year old is obsessed with letter and numbers. these are just great for bath time. we not only work on letter recognition, but spelling. i advise getting 2 sets though because you only get one of each letter.
This pad fits perfectly in my Graco pack-n-play. We take it on road trips so the pack-n-play is a lot softer for our baby to sleep in.  It goes great with the American Baby Waterproof Fitted Quilted Mattress Pad.
these are exactly what i was looking for!  i love that there are even easy recipes on yummipouch.com that i can make and then pop them right in the freezer!  easy to use, easy to clean, and my toddler loves them!
This is the second WubbaNub I have purchased.  My son loves his WubbaNub so much and I've noticed having something on his chest gives him security at night and he loves to hold onto it.  The Bull is adorable too!
my daughter-in law said this was the best thing that she has gotten for gifts...she would not know what to do without it..i bought another one just in case he spits up on it at night she would have a back up one.
pros: machine washable, easy to retrieve for you or baby, easy for baby to maneuver themselves, hospital recommended pacifier brand, cute!<br /><br />cons: must use this type of paci, cost (sort of-but worth it!)
This is the only pacifier we need. Our baby loves it. She spent the first few weeks of her life in the children's hospital, and all the nurses loved this pacifier. It is soft yet durable, and can double as a toy.
These pacifiers are the only ones my son would take.  Had to go to the store to stock up.  We now have over 10 and somehow they still seem to get lost.  The translucent edge makes it look less huge in babys mouth.
my daughter is just over three months old and i attatch this to her playmat. she loves to reach for it and bat at it. i enjoy the different colors and different textures.  this is an enjoyable toy to have for her.
love this item. it goes great with the other accessories i purchased for my son. like how you can take the cars plaque off to transform it into a regular all black dresser. nice product i definitely recommend this
My son uses this brand bottles and one of the bottle packs came with a free I had to go buy them this is the fourth type of Passafire I have tried with him  Plus I love them because they come in  such cute designs
this bag is great and could pack quite lot of stuff for its depth and height. there is a comfortable shoulder strap that makes carry around quite a breeze. the color's cool in black and makes it even more stylish.
This is the brand the hospital gave us. Also, it is the only paci that my newborn will take (if he decides to take one at that moment lol).<br />Very easy to clean, so far very durable. Would definitely recommend.
having all the areas numbered with a map helped, everything applied to the wall great and the picture frames are one solid piece so you can stick the photos on top of the frame with out ruining the wall. i love it
I got this paci to pair with a tuxedo onesie I have as a gift. It is very small (perfect newborn size) and the mustache doesn't overwhelm like some of the other ones I have seen. It's so cute and it was a big hit!
These are way more expensive than the Soothies we usually buy, but we think they are totally worth it for the laughs alone. These pacifiers are good quality, and they even come with covers so they don't get dirty.
This is a super funny pacifier. Only thing is that it is a little big. Better for 7-10 months in my opinion. I really liked it though, but my daughter doesn't use it much because its a little big. she is 5 months.
our two and a half month baby absolutely loves this. she will lay in her crib for a long time just staring at it. love that it has a light and so many different options of what to listen to, including a heartbeat!
works perfect for our baby, since 1 week old. doesn't squeeze the nose or anything and big enough for baby starting at 2 weeks old to keep an hand on it and avoid falling all the time when laying down on the side.
My daughter has colic. The first out of five. I truly couldn't have made it through the night without this pacifier. She didn't sleep through the night, but it soothed her enough for me to get an hour in. Love it!
Adorable design.  I was worried the glow in the dark feature would distract my baby.  It did not.  And as a bonus, it made it MUCH easier to find his paci in the middle of the night after he had dropped/thrown it.
Love this. Bought this for my daughter when she was about 4 months old, and now she can easily find her binky at night without fully waking up (or waking me up!). She's 10 months now, and she brings it everywhere.
love these covers. extra cute and leak proof. my son is 4 months and 18 lbs. we have tried a couple other covers and these are the most comfortable for him and havent had a leak yet. love the velcro and the snaps.
My daughter is very picky about pacifiers these are the only ones she will take i orderd a 5 pack and they all came individually wrapped which was nice because i could just open one at a time. Very good price also
Why didn't anybody tell me about these? I love the way that they hang onto your diaper bag strap. They' re semi-transparent, which is convenient. I wish that I had known about these when my grandson was a newborn.
Certainly is useful to be able to tuck it in to keep the pacifier from disappearing... take note that the pacifier is bonded into the critter, so that it can not be changed or separated from the plush toy portion.
they are for my son's new baby comiing in april so i can't really say how they like it.  but it looks like he will get great use of it because he lives in florida and baby doesn't need a sunburn when out with dad.
Took my 4 week old a couple of days to get use to the wubbanub because it fit alittle different in his mouth. But now we love it!! So much easier to find than and looses it so much less than without this on there.
this cover is very sturdy and painted well. i was worried it would not look exactly like the picture but it does and looks great in my sons nursery! it will make you want to buy the whole kids line sports decor :)
this is great.  it holds all of my son's toys and makes it so easy to clean up at the end of bath time, just scoop everything in and you're done.  the top is nice and wide and makes it easy to get toys in and out.
fits with most of my carriers. it's easy to put on and wraps around baby's legs, keeping the heat inside. good fabric, easy to wash and doesn't wrinkle in the diaper bag. the hood comes of for face front position!
This product is exactly as described.  We really like the Kidz Med Non-Contact Thermometer and would certainly recommend it.  It takes a bit of getting use to it but works so much better than contact thermometers.
we haven't used it yet, but after one wash it fits great on the babyletto mini pure core mattress (which is 3inches thick). quality is good. material is soft. i will update if we have issues once we start using it.
My little girl loves this wubbanub. She likes being able to grasp at it easily so she can pull it to her maw.<br /><br />I like to fly it around a bit before giving it to her saying &#34;I am fire, I am DEATH.&#34;
i bought a pair of these to be used with my grand-children. my daughters-in-law both told me they worked great in shopping carts and in the high chair. for reference, my grand-daughters are 10 months and 11 months.
this sheet is great! it is like a fitted sheet at the bottom (with elastic at the corners), so it stays on my 2-year old daughter's bed with all of her tossing & turning! wish they made big people sheets like this!
love this carrier. after doing it a time or two it is really easy to figure out. i really like that there isn't a lot of extra fabric and it holds baby nice and close. i would definitely recommend this to a friend.
i bought this to put on my sons crib mattress when he switched to a toddle bed. it adds just the right amount of softness to a very firm mattress. he says his bed is nice and cozy now so that's worth 5 stars to me.
I've bought these as gifts and babies seem to really love holding a soft plush toy while using the pacifier. It keeps the pacifier in place and allows the baby to get it themselves when it falls out of their mouth.
This is the perfect size for little hands. My kids never really cared for pacifiers but bought this for car rides and she loved it. This one is so soft. Easily washed and dried with no problems. A cute shower gift.
Out of all the larger gates we tested this one was the best, and also the most economical.  The other units didn't open or close properly or required drilling - this one is old school and perfect for our stairwell!
My son loves this! It helped him hold the pacifier in which was great, and he loved holding on to the dog! And it was much easier to find when it dropped on the ground since it didn't roll under the couch. Love it!
Our daughter is very stubborn about pacifiers.  She wouldn't take one at all until about 3 months old.  She still does not like them, but out of the 7 different types we bought, this is the only one she's accepted.
Definitely helped my LO with gas and colic issues! We had a lot of trouble finding a bottle she would take, when we came across this set. She took to it immediately. And the fact that they are super cute is a plus!
i bought this as part of an amazon.com baby registry.  mom-to-be couldn't be happier!  she's so excited to have baby close by and know that this item is strong and sturdy enough to ease her fears (first time mom!!)
I bought this as a back-up to the Wubbanub catapiller. This is such a great idea to hold baby pacifier in baby's mouth. She loved both but I think the monkey's tail is the perfect handle for Courtney to hold on to.
bamboobies are much better than those bulky throw-away pads.  thin but very absorbent.  i leak a decent amount and they contained it all.  throw in washing machine in a delicates laundry bag.  definitely recommend.
These really are great pacifiers.  They are slightly longer making it easier for your infant to latch plus you can't beat the holder that it comes with that latches on easily and securely which is great for travel.
These are the only pacifiers my little guy will use; I love they're size (they don't block his whole face) and also I love how they always seems to fall facing up (I'm not sure why but it helps when he drops them!)
They're binkies, for a better price than in stores. If you don't have prime, they're a great item to bump you up to free shipping if you need them. And who doesn't always need spare pacifiers if you have an infant.
The Mam Air pacifiers are our son's favorite! There is no top or bottom, so it's great when he finds it in the middle of the night. They are cute too. I love how I can see he little smile through the open pacifier.
we have these is several colors, my baby will not accept any other brand we've tried. She rejected NUK, and I don't feel comfortable giving her a pacifier that covers half her face (like those large round soothers)
This mattress is a perfect fit for my 20 year old cradle. It was shipped neatly wrapped in plastic, so I knew it was clean. It is not too soft and not too hard. I would have to say it's the perfect cradle mattress!
The  perfect size. I can fit five diapers in the wet bag and I use the smaller bag for cloth wipes and spray bottle ( the smaller bag is a little small) but you can put whatever you want in it.  Very pretty colors.
These are so useful for night because you can easily see them in the dark.  Also useful for long plane trips.<br /><br />Hold the pacifier in bright light for a minute to recharge the glow.  It will glow all night.
love this product!  great height for my son at 18 months and still at 2.5 years.  great non-slip surface and loves to use it all around the house.  i would recommend this to anyone!<br />great product, great price!
This little guy, (or girl), is absolutely adorable! My grandchildren loved it and so did the parents. I received it quickly and package nice. Thanks Amazon ! You just can find this kinda stuff in stores very often.
These are great pacifiers. If my son takes them out of the house at least one person is always commenting on how cute they are. My son uses the monkey as a comfort/lovie in addition to just sucking on the pacifier.
a little on the expensive side but well worth the money when you consider the cargo.....love the fact that you can spend the time to properly set the base and easily take the car seat in and out.....great value....
These are such a great idea. My little one loves that she has something cuddly and soft to rub while sucking on her binky.  I also love that it helps her to be able to find it in her bed in the middle of the night.
This is cuter in person than the picture shows.  I saw it a Babies R Us and it was much more vibrant than the photo online, so I ordered it from Amazon.  About the same price at both places.  It holds two pacifiers.
Our baby boy loves these. It's the same ones as the ones they provide in the hospitals. He doesn't like any other kind. It probably is because it's the most similar to a mothers breast? Not sure why. It is BPA free!
My Lil Mermaid just loved a more &#34;Tween&#34; style Bedroom makeover...The instructions and quality of this wall decor was an awesome find !! I can't wait to try another decal on my other Granddaughter's room ...
it's very safe and nice my son enjoy this walker, it is very safe, we can live him right all over the house, i have steps from to room is almost 1 feet high every time he drives there the breaks stop hem, very safe.
Wonderful,my baby daughter loves it.Pretty colors,arrived quickly.Love the price.Thank you.I will continue to order them from you.Wonderful experience.Strong quality.Pretty,comfortable.Inexpensive.Daughter loves it.
Perfect for a small baby...the stuffed animal lays on the baby and the pacifier is just the right size for his little mouth! We had a monkey and had to get a second in case it was lost b/c our baby loves it so much!
Ever since I bought my friend a wubbanub for her son, I've been wanting to buy these for everybody. So far, all the babies seem to enjoy them! I bought this for my cousin and his girlfriend's baby boy. Way too cute!
I got this because my daughter loves turtles and her son already has a bear one. It is easy to locate and easy for my grandson to pick up and put right in his mouth. I would recommend this to anyone that has a baby.
My son is crazy for his wubbanubs, and this is a nice one.  Some hold up better than others in the washing machine, and this is a good example of that.  After many washes it still looks good and not overly worn out.
I love this pacifier My son already lost two pacifier because i can not find a pacifier holder where I live so I brought Wubbanub pacifier so i don't lose it my son love it.  I receive this product on time Thank you
Wubbanubs are so great for newborns because they can easily put them back into their mouth after they have lost them.  They also give them a comfort item close to them.  I buy them for all of my friends with babies!
this is my third child and i had an awful breast pump for my first two. this one i absolutely love. its easy to use, easy to clean, and can be used double or single. it is so easy you will fall in love too!!  <br />
These are the only pacifier my son will use.  He prefers the shape of these orthodontic nipples to the round ones.  I should note that the picture on the front of the pacifiers is starting to wear off after 2 years.
i really like this swaddle.  not only are the designs cute, but the material kept our daughter very warm when we took her to the snow.  no cold toes or hands with this swaddle and she didn't overheat in this either.
this is the bestt bubble maker ever.  my daughter loves it.. nothing is wrong with it.  batteries are required and you can make extra bubble solution your self if you have to once the other one runs out.  great buy.
great product! moving into a house with carpet in the dining room --- our son is a spiller/thrower, so  this will keep the carpet clean while looking nice. heavy enough to stay put, light enough to travel if needed.
My son does not take a pacifier. Not because I didn't offer one but this is perfect because he loves to chew on stuff. There is the pacifier part the rim of the pacifier arms legs and tails and a tag he can chew on.
I think these pacifiers are perfect. But I think anyone with kids knows that anyone can say whatever they want about a pacifier, it all depends on what your child likes.  But these are durable and colorful and safe.
i bought these for my 7 yr grand daughter for christmas and she loved them!  i was afraid they would only fit babies-but they fit her just fine.  she had a taller, more slender build but they're cute as they can be!
i was happily surprised how well these shades work and clings to the windows.  there are no suctions and it doesn't impair the vision as much as i thought it would.  i am going to buy a few more for the rear window.
very nice bassinet, would definately recommend it.  i had to call the company and their customer service was excellent.  they told me it would ship in a few days and it did.  very happy with the product and service.
after our 1st week with this car seat, we are beyond satisfied. our taller than average 2 year old rides super comfortably and best of all, he sleeps soundly without any head flopping forward issues. very satisfied!
The Clevamama Pacifier Sterilizer is a breeze to use and comes with two silicone pacifiers to start you.  We gave this to a teacher at school and she absolutely loves it.  What a thoughful gift! was her exact words.
she wants to look at the toys even when she isn't sitting in it!  this takes up quite a bit of space. would be nice to have the tray a little wider in 1 spot w/o toys so you could put a different toy or snack there.
I love these! It makes it so much easier trying to find the pacifier in the middle of the night, or in the car. My 9 month old loves these, she's gotten so used to them it's weird when she has a regilar pacifier lol.
Chicco pacifiers are the only one we used since our son was born 13 months ago. We tried other ones but Chicco has the best quality and is easy to clean (does not collect liquids inside like others). Love this brand!
My son loved this binky when he was a young baby because he was able to pick it up and bring it to his mouth before he mastered the pincher grisp. Now he loves it as an older Baby because it doubles as a comfort toy!
My baby usually spits out pacifiers, but this one stays in and she seems to enjoy it! It's softer and more velvety to the touch than the one I bought in Albee Baby.<br />I'll order them from this company from now on.
My daughter has been taking these since she was born, shes now almost three and I just cant get rid of them like I wanted to. The nipples are round and wont start messing up on you after all that chewing and sucking.
High quality bottles and pacifiers as always! These are the only ones my daughter will take. This package is a great value.<br /><br />P.S. These bottles do leak if shaken because of the venting system on the bottom.
these plug covers are nicely designed there is enough covers for two homes.  the covers are easy to install, and my grand child can not pull them out.  i feel a lot better now that i have installed these plug covers.
Pacifiers are pretty subjective, but I absolutely love two things about these: (1) The little &#34;handles&#34; make them very easy to pick up, and (2) you can actually see cute little smiles through the cut-outs!  O
I bought this one for my second child because my daugther loved it. It's easy to grab, & I don't have to worry about loosing pacifiers,  it's easy to find if misplaced, definitely a product I would recommend or gift.
this bib is fantastic! our baby is a dribbler, and this bib catches every last drop.  there is a soft elastic neckline that catches everything and leaves her clothing nice and dry.  totally worth the price.  love it!
I LOVE these bottles. They are the only ones my daughter would use once I went back to work and relied on bottles when we couldn't breastfeed! They are self-sterilizing which is a huge bonus! Also very cute patterns!
Great toy, my child has used this since she was born and after a year and a half we have had to replace it. The nipple is sewn to the stuffed animal so you have to clean the entire piece.  Easy for toddlers to carry.

i've tried several brands and these are by far my favorite. they feel amazing, wash up like new & i've never had 1 leak (unlike others). for the price it's silly not to try them. i don't think you'll be disappointed.
this is a wonderful pacifier, i'd recommend starting with this from the get go..my baby loves natural rubber pacifiers and won't touch the silicone ones, this has a nice one piece construct so its easy to keep clean.
i got this for my cousins baby shower, also matching bibs and burp cloths. it was very soft and cuddly, perfect for a newborn, everybody at the shower loved it. much cuter than any pastel walmart or target blanket :)
Excellent quality and safe organic rubber material and most babies love them that actually take a pacifier. Our child won't take any pacifier however. If our child would use pacifiers these would be our first option.
My 3 month old really loves her Wabbanub. It's very easy for her to grab. She mostly plays with the doll and is less interested in the pacifier which is a good thing because I think it will make weening a lot easier.
I was Very Pleased with my Product's, All the stuff i ordered Arived to me earlier than there posted delivery. I am a Very happy Camper...  I Recomend them Highly &#62;&#62;&#62; BIG BLUE COWBOYS STAR &#60;&#60;&#60;
My daughter is 6 weeks old and these pacifiers are the only ones that she seems to like. Sure, they can fall out a little easy but if it soothes her and gets her to stop crying, there is no way I am taking them away.
We used the wubbanub with our baby and she love's them. They are easy for her to find at night on her own as the plush makes them easy to grab. So we bought them for a family member for their soon to arrive baby girl.
This where a basic pacifier for the nights! When the baby lost the pair we missed them. it is great to have a shining pacifier during night as it allows you to find it on the bed without the need of turning lights on!
We tried a bunch of different pacifiers and these worked the best for our baby - he could keep them in his mouth a lot easier then the others we had. These are very lightweight and a good size especially for newborns.
i love the carrier. my only concern is there isn't a whole lot of support for little babies heads. it would be nice if they could have a small cushion there but, otherwise, its a great carrier and he loves it too! :-)
Before I found these I would watch my son on the monitor struggle to find his pacifiers in his dark room during the night.  Give these bad boys a few minutes in the light (sunlight especially) and they rock for hours.
I bought this for my first great-granddaughter and she loves it!  It is really easy to keep track of a pacifier when it is attached to a giraffe.  I bought the giraffe because it is my granddaughter's favorite animal.
I wish I would have known about these sooner! They are a definite must have for car seats, along with everything else! They are so easy to find in the dark in the crib! I will be buying these for new moms from now on!
for the price you can't beat it. the balls get stuck sometime but my daughter (15 months) has no trouble knocking them loose. i like how you can lock it to store the balls with out them rolling out all over the place.
My 1 year old grandson loved his first wubbanub and is now on his second, and loves it even more.  This is so worth getting in that it never gets lost and tiny hands can grab it and place it in their mouths so easily.
i bought the rise and shine grace pack n play.  it looks even better than i thought.  my teenage daughter had it put together in about 1 minute.  and most important my granddaughter sleeps well in it.  great buy also.
My boy has outgrown these awhile ago. We loved them. They're easy to wash and make the kid feel comfortable. I think be bought 20 in all. He finally outgrew them thou and now we're buying them for friends having kids.
placement is the issue. the solution is to hang the turtle from fishing string or another fine, strong string and use the turtle like a mobile. the images are perfect, and center room placement is no longer a problem.
this seat is so easy to adjust and is relatively easy to install as well. the material is super easy to clean and is very easy to get our son in and out of. we are definetly buying another one for our latest addition!
These are great pacifiers. My son loves them and being able to see them in the dark is amazingly helpful!! I have had experiences in the past on Amazon, getting pink or purple when I ordered blue, but these were blue.
this pacifier lasts for very long, has great sweet designs that varies a lot, and has the air circulation holes in middle which we appreciate..  My son literaly throws any different pacifier I try to give im at me..<:
Best pacifiers ever! These last so long and I love that they are natural. I love the size of these as well. Just make sure to boil them when you get them for five minutes as directed. I am a repeat customer for these.
great diaper bag! plenty of room and pockets inside. tons of zippered pouches on the outside. the wipe compartment right on the outside is the best part. also, it's big enough without being ridiculously huge. love it!
I purchased these units after seeing them at our local hospital.  They are great because you don't need any probe covers and they work without having to touch the baby so no need to wake them to see how they are doing.
works to fit about 4 big bottles, and a  bunch of accessories. we typically sterilize all our pacifiers and dr.brown's bottles once a day and we have to run this through twice. cost effective instead of using the bags.
Best sterilizer I have purchased.  I had a cheaper one because I did not want to soend too much.big mistake!! This sterilizer cleans well and dried leaving behind no odors or moisture.  I highly recommend this product.
Wubbanub are amazing easy to stay in baby mouth an easy to keep up with !! With my first I had to buy so many binks from her losing them !! Best invention ever an o so cute , we have this one a caterpillar and a monkey
Why didn't I think of this? When swaddled, our little one will turn her head side to side and the soother will fall out. This keeps it on her chest so that she can find it again, versus it falling to the crib mattress.
My two year old loves his Mickey backpack! He's had it since Christmas and uses it every day to transport his toys around. No sign of any wear and tear. Literally, no sign. It's the best $10 I spent last Christmas. : )
Cute and perfect for a newborn. My daughter loves sucking on the animal part. Very easy to wash. I throw the whole think into the washer and dryer to clean. This binky makes for some priceless pictures with little one.
This is an amazing product!! Exactly what we expected!! So glad we decided to order it through Amazon as we were told through all local businesses that it wasn't available because it was on back order from the company!
i put the car seat cover pad in last night, it literally took 5 minutes! it was very easy to install and to put the car seat in over it. it will definitely protect my car from my toddler crawling in and out of the car!
very cute and have held up well. we have had these decals up for almost a year and there has been no peeling yet. we have other wall decals (different brand) and they are peeling already. very happy with this purchase.
These blankets came in so handy for swaddling our baby during the first month or so. After buying this set, we received an aden + anais set made with bamboo. I highly recommend the bamboo ones. They are SO much softer!
we use this gate for the bottom of the stairs it works great. just be mindful that it has a lip at the bottom of the gate so would not be ideal for the top of the stairs because it's very easy to trip over. great gate.
First of all, I love that I can see the corners of my little guys lips when he smiles with his paci in! So cute! They also made it really easy for him to grab on to when he was getting his finger dexterity figured out.
very sturdy and kept the car seat clean while travelling.  i've now used it about 3 times for international travel and still in good shape. also, there's enough room to put a couple small items once the car seat is in.
I use this bear to help put my baby to sleep, or when he is fussy.  The heartbeat sound works well to drown out other noise and is great in conjunction with Dr. Karp's Happiest Baby on the Block techniques (the 5 S's).
I bought this for my 2 month old daughter.  She didn't get it until just shy of 3 months, and now hugs it, and can therefore hold it in her mouth.  I think they are adorable in come in so many cute animals.  I love it!
we are very happy with this product. it looks good and is very effective at cleaning the bottles. its nice to have a brush specifically for the bottles so the food scrapings from other dishes doesn't taint the bottles.
We haven't had any problems with this, it is much more convenient than warming up a bottle using the stove.  I also like that the cord length can be adjusted so you can have just as much as you need on your countertop.
it's so refreshing to find a sippy cup that doesn't have little pieces to take out and clean separately (or possibly lose).  this is a great cup, easy to clean and my daughter loves the princess design.  great purchase!
My children are long grown!  I haven't shopped much in the baby field since I don't have grandchildren but this is the cutest item I have seen in a long time.  I love the covers that are on pacifiers now, how smart.  bj
this is such a great way to decorate a child's room without the hassle of painting. knowing my daughters taste will change over the years, this is a convenient way of decorating and then changing the design when needed.
Perfect soother for newborn.  I just wish Avent would package more pacifiers with more than 1 color.  I like having multiple colors so I know how many have gone missing.  Both from this purchase are already lost....  :/
My son loves his bull!  The pacifier is well attached which is good as this thing goes with us everywhere everyday. We call it his best friend and joke that he's going to take it to college with him!  Love the wubbanub!
This pacifier is beautiful!! I bought it for my girlfriend and she absolutely loves it!! She thinks its the cutest thing in the world! I will definitely be buying more from this buyer! Shipped fast and had ZERO PROBLEMS
Perfect toddler size pillow! I love the natural filler and cover of this pillow and appreciate the chemical-free design as well. I love how it can be washed and will not bunch up. I highly recommend this toddler pillow.
These are great in the stroller or car bc you can slip them under a harness and much easier for baby to hold, since we don't attach our pacifiers.  I just wash it off and try to keep the toy part dry, or use a toy wipe.
For whatever reason, our son prefers the AVENT pacifiers over all the others.  I also like the freeflow design as he has very sensitve skin and these allow his skin to breath and don't cause irritation like some others.
The tabby kitten wubbanub is very cute and helps the pacifier stay in place for my daughter. The main reason I like it is its very easy to keep track of instead of the tiny pacifiers that I keep losing around the house.
It was a gift for my great nephew (who is 4 mos. old) and I've heard he loves it.  Plus it's great that when he spits out the pacifier the monkey keeps it from falling on the floor (usually).  We HIGHLY recommend it!!!!
swaddling with just a blanket or sheet was becoming so tedious and our little girl was able to kick her way out of it. this product is awesome. it simplifies the whole process and keeps our bundle of joy comfy and cozy.
One of the greatest baby items we own! We have two of these and I am considering a third! Our lo loves it and We love that she can put it back in her mouth in her own! Just can't say enough about this wonderful product!
I will not use any other pacifier for my baby! Not only does it help with breast feeding babies, but it is reassuring to know how safely the product is made - and the components of the pacifier. Will be ordering more! :)
Great for what it is I am sure but does not work well for kids with high arched palates.  It's suggested that you size up so they have more surface area and will have more success holding on to the pacifier on their own!
my granddaughter even she is 9 yr old still love dinosairs and its really hard to find d茅cor for this age group and specialy for girls .this product really brought nice &#34;dino&#34; touch. lol she is happy and so do i.
what a great toy!  my nephew absolutely loves it!  i like it because it's safe and durable...fda approve too!  my sister (mom) would not have it any other way lol!  highly recommended.  fast shipping.  excellent service.
work well. my 17 month old daughter got the hang of it before i did. 99% spill proof. there have been a very few scenarios where there was some leakage, but overall, this cup performs very well. i trust it to do the job.
this was delivered super fast and came in great condition. there was a small nick on one of the drawers but i used a little white out and it covered it. i love the look of these and they were pretty easy to put together.
Wonder but I wish it came in a much smaller case so it's easier to put in my diaper bag.  It's great for around the house and the wipes are small enough for the pacifiers so you know you aren't wasting a lot of material.
Critical to have on hand for a newborn!  Do not leave home without one.  Our baby was not a huge pacifier kid, but these are still amazing when they need to be soothed.  This is typically what the hospital gives you too!
i love the handle on these, and my baby loves to use them!  Easy to clean and carry.  She outgrew her nuk 0-3 month pacifiers and I wanted to stick with one piece silicone and tried these.  Exactly what we both wanted!!!
These pacifier animals are small enough for little hands to hold and examine, are bright and colorful and soft, and the pacifier is just right for teething, chewing and soothing.  My granddaughter absolutely LOVES these!
Cutsie Wubbanub is very cute.  Very colorful and useful as well.  I gave this wubbanub as a shower gift.  It was well received.  Would recommend to anyone.  I also bought another wubbanub for the next baby in our family.
loved the idea of using the toy like appearance to hide the medicine, but was skeptical if it would actually work as easily as it appeared. so i had to try it and it worked great! money well spent on medicine not wasted!
These Wubbanub pacifiers are hands down my favorite.  The little animal on the end is cute and soft and makes finding the pacifier easy in low light.  It also makes it easy for the child to find too.  I highly recommend!
Bought for grandson, transferred to granddaughter. I did not realize from picture this item has pink floral under bod. My son with male child forwarded to son with daughter. She loves it. No longer white. Loved too much.
no hard shield, soothing for baby to suck. One piece so it can't come apart. Base is very nice for teething babies to chew. Doesn't leave marks on baby's face when sucking or if they fall asleep on it. Easy to sterilize.
My son doesn't like pacifiers, but when he does want one the only one he will take is the Dr. Brown's pacifier.  They are small enough for newborns to take.  The only downside is that you can't choose what color you get.
bought this turtle as a gift for my nephew when he was in the hospital.  it was a great hit.  he loved it and all that came to visit liked it too.  very durable and lasts a long time.  havent heard of any issues with it.
Bought this for my nephew. He loves the soothie pacifier, it safely rested on his tummy and kept it in is mouth when he suck REALLY hard (they normally shoot away). When he started teething he chewed all over this thing.
My daughter will only use the Avent soothie pacifiers and I hate them because they bounce when they hit the floor and we are constantly lose them! This product is great because it prevents them from falling to the floor!
My son will only use MAM pacifiers - love these glow in the dark ones.  If he cries in the middle of the night and wants his pacifier, the glow helps them to be easily found in his crib in the dark - my favorite for sure!
this thing is super simple but it made traveling with a car seat so much easier. it fit on our bag perfectly and only took about 30 second to get attached and detached. i wouldn't do air travel with a car seat with these!
Bought this on a whim and sure glad I did. My wife laughed at me initially but now she loves it as much as the baby.  Even at just 6 weeks old we've seen our daughter maneuver the wubbanub back into her mouth if close by!
these are great little cars.  i have about 4 different packs and the small mobile.  i have it above the changing station and switch them out regularly.  my little one loves to name them while we get changed every day!  :)
this purchase arrived quickly and in perfect condition. it is easy to assemble and adjusts to fit different tables. te children enjoy sitting up to the table to enjoy their meal with the family.<br />excellent investment!
Our baby loves this pacifier.  She won't take any other kind.  We've been trying to transition her to the 6-18 month pacifiers, but they seem too big for her mouth so we're sticking with these &#34;baby&#34; ones for now.
I'M SUPER HAPPY WITH MY PURCHASE. ITS WAY BETTER THAN WHAT ITS DESCRIBE AS . ITS SUPER CUTE, GREAT QUALITY , IT CAME WITH THE PACIFIER IT ARRIVED ON TIME. I WOULD LOVE TO BUY MORE SUPER SATISFIED. PERFECT SIZE FOR A BABY.
as good as I expected! our 13mons daughter still needs her wubbanub to fall asleep n we bought it to replace the old ones. this duckie is very cute ; better than her first two wubbanubs which r a pink elephant n a giraffe
Purchased two of these...one for my son who had a preemie and one for my friend as a baby gift.  I had a womb sound bear years ago for my own son who was had colic and found it to work for me.  Hope it works for them too.
i love this crib, it was easy to put together, looks great in my mid-century themed nursery. i love the grey color as well, its not to dark or too light. the product had no smell we took it out of the box when it arrived.
i purchased another set of these that were to deep and would not slide past the closet door hardware.  these did the trick!  just enough short to allow it to slide past the hardware and lock the doors from little fingers!
I am a Nanny to 9 month old twins. I bought this elephant paci as a gift for Easter for 1 of the twins . Usually the paci s get lost are difficult for child to put back themselves but, not with this paci! Best paci ever!!
We started off with a similar pacifier provided by the hospital, but it had a full round silicon disc that he didn't like. These have a similar texture and the oblong shape means his nose doesn't push it out of his mouth.
Got this for my 2 year old daughter who loves binkis...  this is one of her favorites.  She has about twenty of them and she carries them around in a small tray.  She enjoys making people laugh with this particular binki.
my son loves when i stick this in his mouth and sing the brush your teeth song. it tickles his gums. we have been using it since he first got teeth at 7 months and we add it into the routin. he really likes to bite on it.
We've been very happy with this so far! Works very well. It lights up and gives very accurate readings. Very user friendly. We've used it a few times. We've never had trouble with her taking it or keeping it in her mouth.
My son loves his! It gives him something to hold onto and play with when he doesn't feel like sucking. I toss it in the washer with his clothes and it's good as new. I recommended these to everyone that I see with a baby.
This was a great baby shower present.  I previously purchased the monkey wubbanub and my son could not fall asleep without it!  I sort of wish the pacifier part was removable for easy cleaning but otherwise no complaints!
I Love The Wubbanub Pacifiers! My Daughter has 4, Her last one was getting kind of worn, ordered from Babyhaven, No problems at all. And deliverey was on time! I will be ordering from Babyhaven in the future. Great Prices
I got this wet bag to throw in the diaper bag for cloth diapers when we are out. It's super cute, and keeps the stink out! It came with a pacifier bag too! Very convienent. Great price too! Love it. I would purchase again.
I love these pacifiers! They have been the preferred brand for both my sons. The glow in the dark is an added bonus when I have to search for my son's paci in the middle of the night because he has woken up fussing for it.
The Only bottles my baby will take.. also i could find these for a better price.. at Winco Foods they cost $8.00 Each.. At Burlington Coat Factory they cost $13.00 A Pair.. And Here $18.00 for 4 plus 2 pacifiers best offer
i was going to purchase the rattania but when i saw that this was coming out, i decided to wait.  i'm so glad i did.  it looks great and is very easy to clean.  my little one is also very comfortable in it. great purchase!
these are so easy and so convenient! they hold up very well. a lot of strength for their small size, which is great because it doesn't get in the way of folding up the stroller. 2 pack was nice, i got one on each stroller.
He loves these things to death and won't let them go we own about 8 of them know and the baby is a year and he is tickled to death easy to find and super easy to clean. These are a must for any parent or grandparent!!!!!!!
These have become a childhood classic for our 4 children. All have had their own WubbaNub and they are the best pacifiers we've bought by far. And the red dragon was an excellent choice for our youngest boy named Raistlin.
this shampoo smells like the spa. plus, my 2 year old has never cried over it, so i can assume it is gentle on the eyes. i like knowing i'm using a safer product on her hair. plus, this huge bottle should last a long time.
We love this product! There is no better binkie than natural rubber! Our daughter actually lost her first one at the store, and her heart was broken. I ordered one online right away, and got it in a couple days. Thank you!
this product is the best! (or should i say &#34;brest&#34;).  i recommend bringing it to the hospital with you to help in those first feedings.  i have used it every day since my baby came home. he is now three months old.
I've given these to all my pregnant friends. Babies don't lose their pacifiers because they are holding onto the toy. Super durable. You need to order two so that when one is in the washing machine they have the other one!
my little boy loves his pillow! it is very soft, and just the right size for him, although he still ends up sleeping next to it most nights. i bought the two pack of blue pillow cases to go with it, and they fit perfectly.
just perfect for the little one with itching gums.  i was worried that the head would be too large to fit into baby's mouth.  but while the entire head doesn't fit, the ears do!  just the right size for a 6 month old hands.
this thermometer is perfect for when you need to take a temperature and you have a squirmy baby/child.  i like how it is fast and extremely easy to use. i work at a preschool and we use this thermometer several times a day.
i have two kids and they both love to use this set. lots of colors/pictures to look at and also helps remind me to make sure they are eating a well balanced meal. the cup and utensils are perfect size for them to hold onto!
a good size, my daughter (age 6) loves it. i think the only thing i don't particularly like is that the pocket flap doesn't always lay flat, closed. but that criticism is being picky, i think. got here quickly, as expected.
we travel internationally 2-3x a year and this bag has survived all of our flights. our son uses a recaro proride seat and although the fit is tight, it covers it well. just bought a second bag since we're expecting #2 soon
these cups are great for the toddler who wants to use a straw cup on his own, but also likes to throw it around! the lid attaches tightly, no leaks. we reuse these, bought them over a month ago and still using the same set.
mam is the only brand of pacifier that our eight month old will accept. we've tried nuk, avent, and several other brands. this is the only thing that will help him calm down when he's in distress, or simply ready for a nap.
this blanket is almost 4 years old and my daughter is still carrying it around..this is the blanket that became her security blanket. it is still in great condition aside from the dingy coloring and softness loss over time.
This has taught our daughter to reach and grab for her pacifiers and return them to her mouth! Great for car rides because i can always locate it. I have bought these for friends and have a whole assortment for my daughter!
This is a backup to the one we already have. They wash up great and needed one for when the other is being laundered. Not a clean sock or mesh bag is great for protecting it from other items and hang dry in less than a day.
i havent used these yet but i was pleasantly surprised. i bought a pack of plain ones at babies r us for my first child and these are for my coming baby. these are very soft and cushy i cant wait to put them on her carseat!
What a cute lil invention. Got this for my 1 year old and he at first gave a weird reaction but after that he was okay. It looks too cute on him. He has brown hair as well so the mustache goes perfect with his hair color ;)
This is the only pacifier my daughter will use and the caterpillar is so cute! The shape makes it easy for her to get her hands on, which at 6 weeks is amazing. I know other people who have wubbanubs and they love them too!
toy and pacifier in one.  easy for babies to hold.  My son doesn't even like a pacifier but I bought these before I knew that.  He still uses it as something to chew on and it keeps him satisfied when he is in his car seat!
this makes the superyard a little larger but does not interfere with getting around in the room.  this is being used for my puppy and it works great. very sturdy and safe for the puppy and anyone who needs to go in and out.
i am very happy with this baby gate. i have the gate at the bottom of my stairs and it has taken a lot of slamming shut from the kids, and is still holding strong a year later. the gate looks new still, good strong quality.
I recommend this product to anyone and everyone. I luckily haven't had to use this product to much but sometimes when I see it I use it just for the heck of it each time I use it I still get the same great accurate results.
my son has slept with a white noise machine since birth.  my husband and i got this specifically for a plane ride and trip out of town.  my little guy liked it so much that he continues to tote it around the house with him.
my twins, the double a's got these and were off.  this item can grow with them too!  love them. i always do my research and read the reviews on the products i purchase and this just happened to be the best product out there.
my son loves it. i bought this tooth brush just as his first tooth popped through. he now brushes his tooth with toothpaste every morning and night with mommy. makes for a easy task for my 7 month old while i brush my teeth.
Our first daughter did not take to the pacifier, but our second sure does! A friend recommended this brand after trying many with her daughter. We found this brand to stay in the best and keeps her nose clear as it is small.
i bought two sets, and i love it. i cook my baby's solid foods, and these works for containers as well as serve bowls. it is microwavable and easy to clean. it is very handy, and i use it everyday serving my baby solid food.
I bought this for are son.  Its easy to grab while in the car.  Regular pacifiers not attached to anything get lost in the car seat.  Also he holds on to it.  Its something for him to grip on and soothe him at the same time.
My baby girl - aged 15 months -- loved these!! I feel more comfortable knowing they are pure rubber, and they are easy to sanitize and clean.  She bites little holes in them after about 5 weeks, but that's a decent lifespan.
I love these. For the short time my daughter would take a pacifier (as hard as we tried, the thumb won out... darn it) she loved these. They were the only ones she would take. Saving them for the next kid. Worth every penny.
This is my favorite of the wubbanub pacifier collection of ours.  We have the bear, dragon, dinosaur, and sea turtle.  This one is adorable, very easy for my baby to hold on to, and his go to binky.  He loves it and so do I!
nephew loves riding along with the girl this way.  it's a nice, easy low weight addition to the stroller.  i say buy it.  would likely also be great for an older sibling, i'll let you know on that score in a couple of years.
light weight for my 2.5 y to carry (he thinks he is going to school)<br />well-compartmentalized to carry extra clothing and snacks for a 3-6 hr trip to the amusement park<br />no complaints<br />very happy with the purchase
Probably one of the best, important buys of my life!!!! My child ADORED this bo-bo because of the fit. He wouldn't take any other bo-bo so I had to replace this several times! In addition, it was a show stopper for sure lol!
These WubbaNubs are like crack to my daughter. They are easy for little hands to grab onto and when they get dirty I throw them in the washer. They wash great. I've even stitched a new pacifier into one when it got wore out.
We tried a few different brands and these were e only ones out baby would use. It's trial and error bit this was our winner. I like these because they are also easy to clean and there's not a ton of places for water to hide.
i just bought this wrap sling and i adore it! i was having a hard time with other slings so i bought this and it's so simple, so comfortable, and my baby loves it! nursing in it is so easy too. the best wrap sling out there!
i have one of these between the living room and kitchen. it's great! well made and easy to install. also a reasonable price. i much  prefer these to closed doors , my animals can be  kept off company without being left out .
my baby smiles at this thing first time we used it.  he also &#34;talks&#34; to all his friends.  the music only is nice for putting to sleep.  only negative- the music sounds like it needs batteries already after a few uses
Works well with a newborn. This pacifier was recommended by my baby 411 book because it is similar to a woman's nipple. Our 3wk old had no problem going between the nipple and the pacifier and seems to enjoy it for soothing.
My daughter will only take Avent pacifiers.  These are cute, but be warned, they come in random designs.  We got some boy colors, which we are fine with, but if you want specific boy or girl colors order something different.
we have 5 kids.  we have tried about every snack cup out there.  this one is our favorite.  it keeps the snacks in the cup and off the floor.  now if my wife would just use them at the house...hope she doesn't read that.  :)
We purchased this once we removed the breathable bumper (when my daughter started using it to try and climb out, lol). When all the other binkys fall out, this one stays in. Saves me from a midnight trip to give her a binky!
This is a great product for our baby who is instantly calmed when she has her WubbaNub.  It's perfect for her little hands!  She got one as a gift and we had to get a second one for her.  We've also bought two more as gifts!
This pacifier was the perfect paci for my breastfed baby.  She longer will take it, but when it was needed, it did it's job.  I always buy from Amazon, but I like that in a pinch I could pick these up at a local Whole Foods.
These are the only binkies I could get my baby to take. There is no loop which seems to make other binkies too heavy causing them to fall out a lot. And I've been able to use other brands of pacifier clips with them as well.
We placed our order on saturday and we received it on tuesday! Very quick shipping and wonderful product. It is almost exactly like the picture except the zebra stripes are grey instead of black. But it is still just as cute!
i do not like to use paper towels or napkins because of the waste.  so, we have started using little wash cloths for my children at the dinner table.  colors are really bright and have not faded.  my children love the colors.
I love wubbanubs and so does my baby! The soothie style pacifier is the only one he will take, but they are hard to keep in. I like having the stuffed animal attached as it helps keep it in and makes the binky harder to lose.
while you can still see some imprints in the leather after removing the car seat, the leather isn't harmed which is what we were trying to avoid. even in our subaru which has pretty poor quality leather this product did well.
i have a little one just starting to teeth, and he likes to grab things, but i also work full time in a professional setting and feel comfortable wearing this for work and weekend play time! really well made! and very pretty.
My picky baby loves these! Prefect for a breastfed baby. Plus, I had these same pacifiers as a baby, it's nostalgic to see my own little one with them. They smell sweet (but not fake sweet) and can hold up to being chewed on.
this is the second one of these I am buying because my son loves it so much! I had to replace the first one because I washed it one too many times and the pacifier came off. He was not happy about that... so on to number two!
the cutest thing.  call my youngest grandchild monkey so this was perfect.  it was her security item.  now that she has been weaned from the pacifier, we cut the pacifier off and she still lugs the monkey part around with her
My daughter wouldn't  take any other pacifier, so after some research I found the Wubbanub! She loves the nipple shape and although shes still too young to really hold the monkey, having it there keeps it in her mouth better.
My cousin and his wife ended up using this product and absolutely love its ease and convenience. They like that it is small enough to easily fit in a diaper bag and is attractive enough to leave out on the kitchen countertop.
i bought these as bath toys for my 7 month old. teething has reared it's ugly head at our house and i gave him one to chew on when i was at a loss. it is perfect as a teether, super tough, won't tear, and he loves the colors.
this is the best gate.  it looks great and does what it says it will do.  the slats are just the right width that my japanese chin don't fit through them.  once i figured out the hanging instructions it was easy.  a must buy!
my grandson needed to use his cup at daycare instead of his bottle.  he had lots of different cups but they just didn't work well for him.  this is terrific.  he really likes it!  and no bottle any more, and this made it easy
purchased for my youngest's pre-k naptimes.<br /><br />decently made, thicker than i expected. pillow is removable for washing. stitching holding up well with it's weekly wash.<br /><br />wish we'd had these for the 2 elders.
Baby Aspen Sweet Pea 5-pc layette was adorable and was received as promised...overnight delivery!I needed it as a Baby Shower Gift the next day and the Mommy-to-be just loved it. Great presentation in the gift basket as well!
love these bibs !  colors are bright and 2 year old loves both colors. attachment works well and is easy to fasten with one hand. really good product. big pocket works well and all is easy to clean under tap. very satisfied !
This is the only binky my kiddo will use. We are stationed in Japan, and they are not always available at the PX, so I order a ton. I think it got here in 5 days, which is GREAT considering Im all the way across the world! :P
I already reviewed the giraffe but I simply cannot say enough good things about WubbaNub! My son loves to hold the animal and bite on the sides of the Soothie. I always know where his pacifiers are. Worth the $13 or whatever.
Sometimes the pacifier or a toy get a little too gunky to give right back to the child right away, but the kid just wants it. These are great to keep around for a quick wipe down and they don't have that strong cleaner smell.
Best pacifier! My daughter loves to play with the giraffe now that she is older (5 months) and likes to nibble at the edge of the pacifier. The stuffed animal does help the pacifier stay in and makes it easier for her to grab.
i love this tote n glow. it really is so soothing. almost put me to sleep! it has several different songs that it plays. and all of them are incredibly soothing. sure to put your baby in a great mood and hopefully to sleep! :)
i did a bit of research before buying a tv strap. found this one to be well made and works great! like all the other reviews, i too found the screws to be too short so i simply got longer ones. works great. very happy with it.
product arrived two days earlier and in great condition.  box came with an extra pair of batteries, haven't tried those yet. the train illuminates quite nice, just the right amount so you can distinguish all the train details.
This is so cute. I got it for my future Grand son that turned out to be a girl! But it still looks cute. Thank goodness they don't make these in adult size as I'm sure the whole family would get them for funny family pictures!
This is one of the best items I have purchased for my baby. Super cute and it prevents the whole spitting out the soothie and it bounces into hiding problem. I will buy one of these for anyone I know having a baby from now on!
We bought these cause they were recommended since we were breastfeeding but my daughter ended up never taking a pacifier. They really do glow in the dark which makes it easy to find them and they look like they would be great.
I purchased this for my granddaughter. She loves it. It is easy for her to reach out for the monkey when her pacifier falls out of her mouth when sleeping.  Recommend buying a couple, you will have to wash it. We hand wash it.
Our baby loves her plush pacifier. It helps calm her when going down for a nap and for the night and it's so much easier to find around the house and in her diaper bags than a regular pacifier.  WE never leave home without it.
It holds my daughter's soothie pacifier perfectly. The soothie pacifier is not shaped like most generic pacifiers and therefore do not fit most pacifier cases. This case however fits the pacifier and pacifier holder perfectly.
I have purchased several WubbaNub's for baby shower gifts. Babies like to grab the little animal while using paci and they are easy to find once they fall out of babies mouth. They are adorable and I love giving them as gifts.
the fabric they use (velboa, whatever that is) is the softest thing ever. the sack keeps your baby warm and comfy without restricting arm movement. note: this is not a good choice for babies who love to be swaddled. well made.
my infant son loves this little thing.  the exterior fabric is the same material used on many running shoes, so it's not plush at all. the ears make that crakling sound that babies seem to love. i thought that was interesting.
granddaughter loves it and it fits perfectly in her lunch box.  also, mom and dad have those chop stick 'cheaters' that hold them in the right position for learning to use them.  there's enough room in case for them too!  yay!
great to send with my 5 year old to kindergarten in her lunch to school, and to use at home...our 2 year old loves to be like her big sister and these are great to help her have that plus her growing independence.  great find!
these along with the potty they are meant for work great.  they hold a large amount of liquid without spilling or smelling.  i leave these in my car with the potty for times when you can't just pull up to a bathroom right now.
i have used this system before, purchase the newborn set in store and absolutely loves it. my daughter can't give up the bottle yet because it offers the comfort of the breast. this may be my last purchase but its all worth it.
My daughter has had one of these since she was a newborn. She's 2 now & doesn't go anywhere without it.  She literally wears them out.  I buy them 2 at a time so I can always have a clean one available.  She loves hers so much!
We got some great pictures with this pacifier.  My son enjoys sucking on it.  you can sterilize in boiling water which is great. It is very sturdy - my son likes to chew on the outside of pacifiers too and this one has held up.
when i have my first grandchild come and visit i have this to place him in.  i love how easy it was to &#34;put together&#34;.  i would recommend this playard to all who would like a safe environment for their child/grandchild.
I bought this as a gift for my friend. When she asked me to look for a binky with a mustash i looked at her like she was crazy. When i recieved the package I LOVED it. Its so cute and i just hope her little one will love it. :)
My baby prefers this pacifier to all others at 1 month, and it definitely has a soothing effect. Since she liked these so much I bought some more from Target in the vanilla flavor which she loves more than the regular pacifier.
my toddler loves this toy!!! she loves changing the attachments and watching the different splash patterns. normally she does not like water on her face, but doesn't mind when this toy does, because splash is light and minimal.
There's nothing fancy about these, but they do what they are meant to! We attach them to a variety of our son's toys and then to the carseat, stroller, or shopping cart and we aren't losing things along the way! Great solution!
it's a big friggin hook for holding stuff on the stroller among other uses. i will say, however, that it is overpriced (harbor freight has some non-branded ones for $1.99) but worth the cost of not having to drive to the store.
Our twin sons love these.  They are our 'mute' buttons :)  We've ordered multiple packs of these and don't leave home without them (we didn't really use pacifiers with our daughter but they've been very helpful with the twins).
when you look at our 11 month old, he does look swallowed up in this item, but it works great.  it keeps him warm, gives him plenty of room to wiggle, and he's able to walk.  we have not had an issue with the legs falling down.
First time grandmother cannot give grandson anything but the best....and this is it.  He and his mom LOVE the Wubbanub because not only is it a quality pacifier, but Mr. Giraffe and Mr. Monkey keep it within easy reach of baby.
I love these little binkies! My son has 3 and they don't get lost or left behind as often as some of the other ones he used. I get a lot of compliments. They are washable and durable and double as teddy bear. I would recommend.
seems like a very nice product.  i have been trying for months to get my son to take a pacifier, but he does not want it!  but i give it 5 stars because it seems very well made, and i like that they come with individual covers.
very cute! just the ticket for young back-to-schoolers, or those just starting out. the matched set of the backpack and the lunchie are adorable. gender neutral dog, appeals to both boys and girls. very nice quality and design.
My daughter will only use the Avent soothie pacifiers and I hate them because they bounce around when they fall and we are constantly losing them. This product is perfect to stop them from falling and are great in the car seat!
good product, prompt delivery time. great price.  no problem to assembly them, you just have to check the picture in the instruction carefully to match the holes, no additional tools needed.  everything is in the whole package.
The wubanub is great! Its light enough to remain on baby's chest so that you don't lose it. Baby can grab this a bit easier than just a pacifier alone. Her Ellie is her favorite paci & toy! Definitely recommend it to any parent!
I have one of these at home already and needed a new one to replace the old. I love these, they are great for your infant. My daughter loves it and has so since birth. The seller was great and I got it fast too! Overall LOVE IT!
Great quality! Great product! My grandson loves his new pacifier! I bought 6 or 7 differnet pacifiers and my grandson didn't like any of them until we found this one. He loves the large round center! I now have a happy baby boy!
Super Cute & Super Soft. Bought this for our son because he already has the Doggie Wubbanub & loves it. we wanted him to have an extra. This one is even cute than the Doggie and way softer. Will be buying as gifts in the future.
My little one loves it and has been using it since 2 1/2 months old. Now at 5 months it is our go to for nap time. Very easy to wash by hand or throw in the laundry, and seems to be holding up so far despite heavy every day use.
This is the easiest pacifier for my daughter to latch onto. Very soft unlike the orthodontic pacifier.  Last for a long time.  Have had mine 2 1/2 years and it is showing no sign of wearing down.  Would recommend this to anyone.
Love these pacifiers! So much easier to find when dropped than the normal Soothie and, at 4 months, my son is able to occasionally get it back in his mouth thanks to the arms and legs of the puppy. These wash up really well too.
My son loves these NUKs. He has used them since he was a week old. I liked the solid colors of the nuks, how ever the ones we got were pink and purple so we gave them to our friends as a shower gift since they are having a girl.
this sterilizer is an absolute must.  a quick hand wash, and i don't have to worry about the rest.  it can fit the parts to my isis iq duo, bottles, pacifiers, etc.  it doesn't take much counter space, and keeps my kitchen neat.
I put this in my wife's stocking after we found out she was pregnant. She loved it. I am sure it will work great for the baby, but I assume no one is looking at this for a long term solution, but just a short gag here and there.
BPA free is a must.  Also one piece is a huge benefit.  Nothing gets nasty.  Buy at least three of them though.  Your child won't want another paci after she/he has this.  The only paci I would let my kids put near their mouths.
i ordered this set for my new son's nursery and received it today. i could not be happier! the quality is amazing, the colors are beautiful, and you can't beat the price! i would highly recommend this! you won't be disappointed.
It looks too big at first and a lot of people will say it is ugly but it has been great for us. My baby loves it and it is easy to clean. Also, since it is all rubber it doesn't hurt her or mark her face when she sleeps with it.
My son loves these.  One of my cannot live without baby items for sure.  They are round, like a real nipple, instead of flat, and you can put your finger inside the nipple, so they really feel like they are sucking on something.
A great product. Cute and very functional. Little bear helps baby hold on to paci or it can lay next to baby in bed. They used these in the NICU when my preemie was born, and they're now a staple for all of my baby shower gifts!
very good customer service! there are believers and non believers that this works. i think it's what you think will help your child. teething is a very uncomfortable period, i'm willing to try this if it helps even a little bit!
bought these for our 9 month old when she starting cruising to keep her from bonking her head on the sharp corners of our wooden coffee table. these are great! easy to put on and stay put. they provide nice padding. a smart buy.
My grand-daughter does not  like any pacifier except the shape of this one.  I think it is more like the shape of a normal breast.<br />Soooooo, she has several.  These can be boiled and kept clean and there is always one handy.
This is the only paci my son would take. Like what others said, this was given in the hospital he was born. It was really a life saver on those fussy moments! Helpful to have a couple of these in your bag, car, crib, daycare etc!
5 Stars! Recommended for newborns & Toddlers, Nicu babies as well. This is one item I will give as gifts because its unique and I can proudly say that all babies that I know have not refused it and end up falling in love with it!
These are a little pricey, the gave one to my son while he was in the NICU at UCSF and he loved it, it was easier to stay in his mouth, he doesn't really use a binky now but still plays with it and its a fun thing to have around.
This is the second one of these we have purchased and they are both great products. Would definitely recommend purchasing. They are nice because I don't know how many pacis we have lost but these are pretty hard to lose track of.
this is a great changing pad.  it closes up to easily fit in a diaper bag or large purse , has room for wet wipes, diapers etc.  and can quickly and easily be wiped clean.  i highly recommend it and the color choices are terrific
made the expense of the stroller much more worthwhile since we can turn it into a bassinet by our bed.  easy to fold down and use for travel.  very sturdy and doesn't take up much space.  can store baby items on the bottom shelf.
Although they get a bit sticky after a while and bounce off like crazy when you drop them, they are much softer then silicone and my son used to chew on it when he was teething. If you're gonna use a pacifer, give this one a try.
I love the Wubanub line of binkies! They are so cute and great for helping my little one learn to grab things and they are easy for me to grab too when she drops it. I have a couple of these now and will probably be getting more.
i found this in other stores and the price was much more. i think this is the best lamp for my jungle theme nursery. the quality is great, and the little monkey light switch, which hangs is so adorable. great product all around !
my son loves this play mat. it's so bright & colorful! i love that it has the lights! also, the music you can put on a loud/quiet option and also have it be on constantly or just when they hit one of the toys. great for learning!
so happy with these mitts, stay on the hands yet are not constrictive.  they are also really soft which is nice because she rubs her hands on her face a lot.  i would recommend them and consider giving them as gifts in the future
i love that it only cost me 161.81 and i got a stroller,car seat and a base for the car seat great deal and the product its self looks preety  safe i havent used it yet because i just got it and my baby is not here to use it yet.
I love this pacifire! We used the plain ones and they were always falling out and into the ground. With the kitty attached it sits nicely on her Chest & she hugs it! Very light weight, adorable & great quality! Highly recommended
love this bag! it's so convenient to wear when traveling with a little one. it has tons of compartments and its very cute. i'm constantly getting asked where it's from. i highly recommend it and wish i would have found it sooner!
this is small, sturdy, and great for the price.  it takes up minimal space on the counter yet holds all my bottle pieces and accessories and then some.  i would recommend this over some of the fancier ones.  it does the job well.
When my son was a newborn he was very picky about pacifiers.  I must have tried 20 different ones before finding one that he would take.  Now he loves his Nuk binkies and has also transitioned to he sippy cups with teh soft spout
These are easy to find at night, you can buckle the animal part in the car seat with baby so you don't have to hunt it in the car! My boys both loved to just hold the light weight animal and used them for chew toys when teething!
this carrier is super comfy and a great fit.  it's so much more reasonably priced than competitive brands and, in my opinion, more comfortable.  my husband and i each strap one of our twins in and we're on the go, wherever we go!
This is amazing. My daughter had problems holding a pacifier in her mouth and couldn't yet pick it up to put it back in. Well she could hug the lamb and it would stay in. I would highly reconnect this to anyone with a little one.
I bought this lion and the puppy when my son was 4 months old and he started teething. He loves it and I love it too! I have received a compliments on how cool the product is and I tell other moms to check it out at Amazon.com =)
no leaks here (so far) and they are beautiful. my daughter especially loves the white 'peacock' one! easy to clean spouts too. seem a little roomier than some we have and you can see better if it's getting clean or not. good buy!
My son is a breastfed baby who is also bottle fed at his sitter. He has never loved a pacifier, but when he is in the mood, this is his favorite one. He also likes to chew on all sides of it when he is teething. Highly recommend!
i purchased this as a gift for my 2 year old.  she enjoys caring this backpack around with her little items in it.  the bag was delivered as expected, it was packaged well, and had no defects. i am very happy with this purchase!!
My baby girl will not use anything else, they are easy to clean and have held up very well so far. I would definitely recommend these to anyone that is having a hard time with their baby accepting other brand/shapes of pacifiers.
This dragon soother has saved us countless pick-ups off the floor.  When the soother pops out we have time to get it before it slides off her body.  She also pets the plush dragon while soothing herself so it serves two purposes.
this is kind of a flimsy plastic and we could only use 2of the 12 or so pre-drilled holes. but works perfect. not for our dog per se'  it's for our turtle.. it took one look at it and turned and walked away.  well worth the price.
Best binkies ever! They close when dropped. But because of the small holes on the side, we put the binkie clip elastic through the closing part, so that it stays half open, that way my 11 month can put it in his binkie by himself!
my daughter loves this tub.  it's easy to use, easy to clean, and allows my daughter to sit at such an angle on the little ledge that she can kick her legs and splash.  she has a ball!  also love the little toy that comes with it.
this product is great!  first introduced this to my baby at two weeks.  she had reflux and the pacifier seemed to help sooth her. still loves it today and she's 6 months.  we have three different ones but the lamb is our favorite.
its great because of a few reasons  1) the right/left side you could tuck under(vary important)  2) its washable  3) its comfortable  4) water does not go through  but one miner suggestion i would have it should be a little longer
i've never owned a baby monitor cam before but i know that there are a lot of brands out there with too much trouble. this is the first one i'veever  owned and i'm really happy about it. i trust this brand and highly recommend it.
My daughter is obsessed w/her Wubbanubs (yes, we have 6 of them).  This one is SO CUTE and totally girly.  It washes very nicely too.  A couple others we have are covered in lint after washing and this one isn't.  Worth the price!
i tried using both a bouncer and a swing for my colicky 2month old, but neither seemed to work. although the mamaroo is a little pricier than swings/bouncers, it sure is worth it. my daughter loves being on it. highly recommended.
i love the pillow and the fact that the blanket is bigger so she can cover her self better, easy to roll it up and light weight for her to cary it with the handle - perfect for my 3 yr old ( it was a hit at her school sleep over )
These are a lifesaver. The baby throws every toy off his high chair or at a table at a restaurant, which means constantly picking them up and picking up dirty toys. They also work great on strollers. I have already purchased more!
so much room and such style! i love using this bag. it holds all the essentials plus extras. i adore the stroller straps but worry about how heavy the bag may be...i will update as time goes on. so far the bag has held up perfect!
this is an awesome rocking horse that we hope to have for many years to come!  our girls love it and it was very easy to put together.  the cognac color is also a very nice stain!  great price and we felt like we got a great deal!
this is my second baby with nuk binkies. love them, the best part is the little ring can be stuck on a finger for easy holding while feeding the baby. you do not have to do the search and find after the feeding is over. love them!
My baby isn't picky when it comes to pacifiers. These suit her just fine, and I love that they come with tops/plastic enclosures. This way we can travel with them or keep them in a pocket without worrying about getting them dirty.
Amazing when your daughter needs to self soothe during the night. Regular pacifiers I can't find them without turning the light on. MAM pacifiers are the only pacifiers that my daughter will accept. It's soft for her little mouth.
my grandson managed to break off one of our knobs to our gas stove, so after replacing it, i decided to invest in these.  best thing i ever did - he twirls them around, but he cannot open them (he's two).  no more replacing knobs!
where was this product when my kids were little?  i purchased this for my grandson.  it fits the crib well, you can attach toys to it, and it saves the crib from teething damage.  it is a medium weight fabric.  perfect for my uses.
Love this pacifier. It is just like the ones issued in the hospital - only it's not green. I purchased this because of it's girly colors. My baby doesn't like any other pacifiers other than the soothie. Love it and so does baby! :)
Grand baby loved the one that I got previously and I decided to purchase another one for the pregnant daughter of a dear friend.  These are the best.  Not only are they cute, but baby learns to hold on to something soft and cuddly.
I like that these are more low profile than the bigger MAMs. My daughter likes these kinds but she used to get pink splotches around her mouth from the plastic resting in her skin while she sleeps. She doesn't have that with these.
got these burp clothes in addition to the towel and wash clothes. they are high quality - good absorbancy - and we've washed them several times and they have held up very well. very cute. also more than enough to clean up spit-ups.
avent pacifiers are great, last long enough and even though my child is 11 months he still uses 0-3 months size, as recommended by my pediatrician. They glow in the dark, only the handle, and are easier to spot in the crib at night
These are my baby's favorite!  She has liked them since she was a newborn and now that she is almost 5 months old, she likes to stick her finger in the middle and take it in and out of her mouth.  It is also a good teething device!

Unique, fun, ad functional. Better than the cheap-o fabric/velcro ones! I bought a few different styles of the bink links and they are all very cute. Especially nice because they will fit through the holes of the big Soothie pacis.
I'm in love with this passifier.  My son likes this one a lot but the monkey is his favorite.  It is great from birth through 6 months or older.  It helps him keep it in place.  He is even learning to put back in his mouth himself.
I honestly thought these were a joke and couldn't believe parents paid money for these. I'm hooked. These saved my sanity and precious time. I hardly have to binky hunt now! My son loves them. They are easily washed. No complaints!
We have tried two other brands of pacifier and this is the only one my son (5 months old) likes. I appreciate the snap-on cap feature which keeps the pacifier clean in my purse or in the diaper bag. Very pleased with this purchase.
i had purchased the medela disposables... after i ran out of those, i ordered these because the price was lower... turns out these are wayyy more comfortable, absorbent, and look better in my purse than any other brands i've tried.
love this! perfect for traveling or putting in your bed. my baby used this from 3 to 6 months and got use to it so much that when i transitioned her to her crib she wouldn't sleep. we went on two vacations and she slept in it fine.
I love the design of these and wanted my baby to love them too but we have tried other pacifiers and he just won't take them.  Guess our baby isn't a pacifier baby but that is okay because that is one less thing to wean him off of!
this is the best nuggey anyone ever made my granddaughter is Two and she won't suck on any other pacifier so I bought her 17 this Christmas I wish you would come down in price but they are the best Staten Island New York lady rider
this is the stroller i have wanted for years but didn't know it existed. it is a compact stroller that can do everything i need a stroller to do. basic, simple, compact and well made. works well for a large range of ages and sizes.
we love this roomy pack n play, which is so much bigger than the other ones. we have a tall baby who scoots around in her sleep so this is perfect for her to sleep over at the grandparents, but also play in during the day. love it.
i've only owned this set for a month but my almost 2 year old loves it! its a very silky feeling material - i wish it was more like cotton but i couldn't find a full set for cheaper. so this will work. :) kids happy so mamas happy.
i love the idea of this bag, but the zipper on it would scratch me every time i tried to get something in or out of the bag. other than the zipper it is a good bag (i meant to give it 3 stars, but for some reason i can't edit that).
This is the only pacifier my newborn seems to take. (I've tried atleast 4 other types.). I like the bright yellow color because I used them for soothing her during bedtime and am able to easily spot it in her crib once she's asleep.
Mine will go back and forth between this and a Nuk pacifier but she holds onto this while in the carseat either way.  We bought a few different styles, the elephant specifically to try to keep it near her mouth when we were driving.
Love these. I have been trying to find pacifiers that don't hold the soap bubbles and water after washing. These do a little bit, but not as bad as the Nuks. The Nuks and these are the only ones we can get our son to take right now.
My baby loves this binky! It has taught him to hold on to things as well. I like it because I can kind of 'prop' it up on him when he is laying down, and it stays in his mouth. Great quality and very cute! You won't be disappointed!
This was the perfect gag gift for my sis in law. It's really an inside joke but i could not pass it up. A little on the high side in price. If they sold it in stores would be much more worth it but cute and funny served the purpose.
Ive been a cowboys fan the moment I was born in 92'! My dad is a die hard fan so it's only right that I set my daughter on the right track too! The product is beautiful. I will deff be buying from this seller again!! Thank u so much
Although my son, is NOT a lover of pacifiers, when he is overtired, worked up, and/or teething . . this is the only pacifier he will take. It is a blessing that there are other items out there, that can give me a break from nursing.
these headbands fit my two month old daughter perfect. not tight like some other brands. high quality and exactly as pictured. these are perfect. came in the mail quickly and packaged nicely. ill be purchasing more from this seller.
got this for a baby shower gift for my daughter-in-law, had been recommended by a client.  this is a great gift, easy to set up and take down, perfect for taking along for visiting and just the right size for a newborn up to a year.
I love this Wubbanub. I would love to have all the different ones. It's the best thing for a baby. Mom's will love you for this gift. Always good to have several around.[[ASIN:B0028IDXDS Wubbanub Infant Plush Toy Pacifier - Monkey]]
i bought these for my 10-month-old and am very happy with them. they hold just the right amount of food and it doesn't spill off the sides. perfect size. nice to hold and work with. easy to clean. they are my favorite spoons so far.
We love this!! Easy to use and easy to clean....I love that you can just pull it apart....my little girl loved her strawberries in hers....and plan on doing breastmilk when she's teething....the added lid for on the go is great too!
our infant daughter has trouble keeping the other more expensive pacifiers in her mouth, but not the AVENT. the clear plastic allows you to see the mouth and whether or not it is dirty. skip the more expensive ones and get this one.
this is the perfect size and price for a toddler, especially when you consider she drags it everywhere with her. i ended up buying three: one for daycare, one to carry around, and one for her toddler bed. can't beat it for the price!
Item was delivered within a week. My husband was a little hesitant about the purchase as he thought the stuffed animal would weigh on our little one's neck; however, it's VERY lightweight and charming. We purchased the pink elephant.
these have been the most leak-proof cup i have found. you must make sure the valve is fully pushed in though. a little difficult to use as a first sippy cup though, because you have to drink pretty hard to get the liquid to come out.
These are the perfect fit when other calming methods have failed. They are simple and effective. My husband and I got a kick out of them because the nipples are hollow, so you can see into your baby's mouth while they are sucking :-)
Bought this for my grandson who's due next month. His mommy wanted an Alabama themed nursery and this fit in well with the bedding set I bought on Amazon. It's cute, looks sturdy enough and has the type of pacifiers we wanted to use,
What is there to add?  Baby loves her binky and it's incredibly handy to have extras around the house or in her crib when she spits it out in the middle of the night and goes searching.  Plus it helps bring out the color in her eyes.
My 2 year old is just addicted to pack's, she used to only take the Avent ones but was willing to use these as well.  Cute designs and soothes a fussy girl.  Prices are good so I buy extra because you never want to be without a paci!
my friend told me she loved this calendar, so i bought it for another friend.  i hope she'll enjoy it just as much!  :)  i think it's a great, easy supplement or alternative to a baby book.  seems very simple, user friendly and cute!
This is a very cute piece that works better than traditional pacifier holders. It doesn't pinch clothing and leave marks, rather rest on the baby. Works as a pacifier holder and give baby a little friend to hold onto and cuddle with.
my children love it. it's long enough to fit my 2 and 3 year old when they want to brush their teeth and wash their hands together. it's light enough for my girls to move it from the toilet and back to the sink. i have no complaints.
I wasnt sure how light would be able to purify a pacifier, however, this really works pretty well. I would like there to be some kind of a test strip or other they could provide with this.  However, I like it better than using water.
it's a great idea to use as a self soother instead of a pacifier.  sometimes my son can't find the pacifier in the dark room so he plays with his silkie.  also love that you get two so he always has one when the other is in the wash.
My 3 month old loves this binky. She cuddles the lamb while she sucks the binky. I am so thankful for this product. Her daycare provide also loves this item as well because of how well it stays in place. A must have for any new baby.
I always give wubbanub a as gifts. They are easy for older babies to hold and stay near the mouth of smaller babies without the strangulation risk of a pacifier holder. They hold up well in the washing machine. My baby loves his too.
this item works great. it's thick and strong and really helps to protect the seats from indents of the car seat along with food and moisture. it stays put too, no slipping. i like the extra lil pockets for storage. i would recommend!
i am not breastfeeding, but this is certainly a useful product because i place my baby in it to feed him as well as keep him upright for a while after feedings to reduce spitting up.  the adorable sheep on it adds to the cute factor.
I only wish these weren't so expensive because my daughter is an addict to this style.  I love that they glow in the dark and look super cute in the mouth.  We've always used these pacis with all three of our kids and they are great.
I bought this for an aunt who is legally blind. This glows RED if she has a fever, so she knows then to call someone to read it for her. It might not sound like much -- unless you can barely see. What a great product. Thanks so much.
The one and only!  36 years ago our daughter was a pacifier pioneer.  This is the only kind she would take!  I have a young friend that I order these for her and after trying so many others, now it is the only kind her son will take!
i keep ordering these covers.  they are perfect for my daughter and keep her hands and panties from toughing gross public toilets.  these covers fix on just about every toilet style out there and are perfect for carrying in my purse.
it was sent as a gift for my new grand daughter.  she is too small yet but will enjoy it, i am sure, as one of her first toys!  the baby's mother said this toy is rated high and is very glad her infant daughter received it as a gift.
these cups are just adorable. my baby wouldn't take other sippy cups with their complicated valve systems but she loves these. i'm glad they started putting characters on them instead of just a plain cup. very happy with our purchsse.
sofie is one of the best teethers ever! my grandson loves it! it's a great gift for a baby shower or just a gift for what ever. this is the 4th one that i have bought and will continue buying them! they are a hit for teething babies!!
I was looking for pacifiers and came across this.  It is the cutest thing.  I haven't had a chance to use it yet as I still have two months to go.  My friends that have seen it want one so I will be buying a few more to give as gifts.
these cups are very cute and easy for our child to use.  the handles are easy for small hands, and the large silicone top is easy to drink from.  when my child is teething, i use these cups with cool water to help with the discomfort.
very sturdy! i love them and have found numerous uses for these besdesstrollers and walkers. my canopy poles, for display, my seats at the beach tohold my bag..,even used one on a tension pole to hold extra hand bags. these are great!
Works great! No more losing the pacey in the crib! No more rolling under the couch! No more digging in the car seat! No more silly hooks and straps! We love it and wish we would have bought an extra for the times when it needs a wash.
I ordered these for my son who is not yet here , but know how very much I love these because ever since 2004 with my daughter, I have used them. They are excellent for exclusively breastfed babies because they mimic the nipple of mom.
perfect size, holds two nuk pacifiers and it saves a great deal of time and frustration when needing to grab a paci real quick. The snap isn't too hard and the material is nice.  It can easily be wiped down with a damp cloth to clean.
this is such a great lamp! it's so cure and really really good quality, it even came with a light bulb! i bought with without  knowing  if i was having a boy or girl, i ended up having a little girl and it looks perfect in her room :)
My baby loved it. Now as a toddler she still loves it. It is hard to lose, easy to hang onto and a toy and a binky in one. It is well put together and has never cracked or frayed. You can just toss it in the washer and let it air dry.
I tried so many different pacifiers.. something about these make our little girl like them better than the others.  She feeds with a nipple shield, so that probably means that she gravitates towards different shapes than other babies.
i love this playpen! it is sturdy enough for my toddler and i would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to buy a good playpen! my only wish is that it was a little cheaper, but other than that, i would definitely buy it again!
These are the only pacifiers we trust with our baby. While the cost is questionable...the ingredients to make the pacifiers are top notch and are devoid of dangerous chemicals (such as BPA). They last on average about 2 months for us.
i thought this was a waste when i bought it. we have a blender already so what's the point? i couldn't have been more wrong. the convenience of having everything in one is awesome. it's a huge space saver and makes food prep a breeze.
very cute swim trunks! this is only for the swim trunks. it does not come with the matching rashguard shown. my mistake i didn't read it was only for the swim trunks. overall too cute! i bought this for my son for next swim season '09.
my husband and i purchased this item to protect our baby's car seat on our first flight with baby. it was quick and easy to use, kept our car seat clean, and will definitely be using it again at the end of the non. we'll worth the buy!
not only did the father and mother to be love them. all the guests did as well. they were even more attractive than the pictures. close though. i would by them again for someone else. thanks amazon for helping me purchase them on line.
My  daughter loves the pacifier holder for the diaper bag. She loves it for carrying an extra pacifier since it is so easy to misplace them. Very good price and nice products. I am happy I purchased it for her & I Would recommend them.
True, the glow in the dark part usually fades by early morning, but I would still buy these again! These are one of the few pacifiers that my daughter uses. Without the handle it's harder for her to pull out of her mouth, which i like!
my son loves this pillow. he is 3 years old and it gives him just the right support for his head and neck. the fact that its so shallow and forms to the body, neck,head shape of the child makes me worry less about his neck development.
I got  these to give as a gift in one of my craft projects. They were the perfect size and the colors were beautiful. They also come on a case to keep them clean. I would recommend these pacificiers to anyone who needs a good pacifier.
I have had this thermometer for a few months now and have enjoyed using it, and it only takes a couple of seconds to get an accurate reading. Read the directions, become acquainted with it and you will be very satisfied as I have been.
Our daughter is obsessed with her wubba. In fact so, we now have 3 of them for all areas of the house. I know they are a bit pricey for a pacifier, but worth every penny. She can even find it at night in her crib easily to self soothe!
An excellent choice for our son. We have tried a few different brands of pacifiers but none stayed in our son's mouth for more than a minute. Once we received your product and sterilized it, our son immediately loved it!<br />Thank you
Let me start out by saying we are not a big pacifier house.  However...we do use them until our babies are about 3 months.  We bought these to have a few extras around the house.  They are the same as the ones they use at the hospital.
this seat has worked great for my boy/girl twins! the potty shield keeps the boy from making a mess but does not stick up so high that they have a hard time getting over it. i love that it has an air freshener. i got refills at target.
We initially bought some of these as a joke for my son but it turned out that they are the only ones he will use. Great price on Amazon and can't beat free two-day shipping (Prime). We constantly get compliments on them wherever we go!
this item arrived within the given timeframe with a little excitment that i didn&uacute;vt anticipate. although it wasn't anything valuable but definitely added value and left a good impression.<br /><br />i would recommend to friends.
This product really doesn't need a review.. its a great product. Obviously..thats why the hospitals give these to the infants after birth. When my son lost his he wouldnt take different pacifiers so we had to buy a package of soothies.
I have ordered these pacifiers before and they have always delivered them very fast. I just ordered more a few days ago and I just recieved them and they sent me the color i wanted and needed after I emailed them. I am extremely happy.
We tried 3 other brands of pacifiers and our son seemed to be able to keep Dr. Browns in his mouth much easier than any other. It also seemed to pacify him faster/better - perhaps because he wasn't frustrated with trying to keep it in.
my son loves this pacifier! before I purchased this he wouldn't take any other pacifier but once he tried this it was the only one he showed interest in, he didnt immediately loved it but the more he used it the more he got used to it.
for anyone with children, or if you just want to organize, this item is soo perfect. my 3 and 4 year old can not get into it no matter what they try. perfect safetly precaution. i am going to buy another one for under my bathroom sink.
Love this cute &#34;toy&#34; that replaces the need for multiple pacifiers.  No longer does a mom have to retrieve the pacifier dropped or thrown by her toddler...and then find a way to clean it before giving it back to the fussy baby!
i really like these pouches. they stand up well and hold quite a bit. at first i wasn't sure how the spout on the side would work but its actually easier for my one year old to do on his own. i also love that they are dishwasher safe!!!
Shaped like nipple, doesn't cause nipple confusion. My baby was given one of these from  hospital so we bought extra for house. It's the only kind she likes. The Avent ones that look similar are a harder plastic and she won't take them.
Love love love this pacifier pod! I now have 3 one on my diaper bag, one on my car seat and one on my stroller it is so handy to always have a back up pacifier accessible at all times, no digging through a full bag while the baby cries.
i purchased this item for my best friend. its perfect for someone seeking an smaller alternative to a crib, because it looks and acts as one. the shipment came exactly on time, i loved the whole process and the bassinet. great purchase!
My daughter really likes this. I was afraid it would be heavy but she is able to keep it in her mouth well and she holds onto the toy. It's really cute. She is 9 weeks old and it is a lifesaver when she wants to nurse but it isn't time.
we have recently purchased the infant optics dxr-5 and i must say that with all the monitors we have purchased, this is by far the best and most reliable monitor. we also think that it is very reasonably priced. all in all, we love it !
All my kids have loved these things. It makes it easier for babies to find and grab it if they drop them in their car seat or crib. We've even cut the pacifier end off when the kids got older so they could keep sleeping with the animal.
it is super easy to add on to my existing gate, just a quick snap in. now, the original gathering strap is no longer functional due to the larger size, but that is the only negative i can see. the 2 extra panels makes a huge difference!
this mattress is nice and firm, great quality and fits perfectly in our daughters graco lauren 4 in 1 crib. so glad we purchased this one after researching several crib mattresses. the price is fantastic and definetly worth every penny!
Bought Avent 0 to 6 months and she kept spitting it out then I bought these and she latched on right away. She loved it and still do at 5 months. I compared them and saw the Avent nipple was way bigger. Not cool for newborn baby at all.
Nice product although, like other reviewers, I received pink and purple for my little boy (the package in the product image looks red but it's really pink). I was aware colors may vary but I was hoping they'd at least be gender neutral.
Love these. Rather than buying separate stuffed animals and pacifiers/nooks, this gives the baby something to hold onto, helps them find it when upset, and are generally just awesome. This particular one was for a gift and they love it.
cute starter silverware set for our daughter. she loves elmo, and these get her excited to try to use them with her food. they are short, so perfect for little hands (she's 17 months old). they are well made and i would buy these again!
with twins and two kids 14 mos apart i have had my share of double strollers.  this is a great stroller for the mall or going on walks.  turns on a dime.  exactly what i was looking for. best thing about it is it fits through a doorway!
this gate is great. it is so hard to find a regular tension gate for wide doorways.  this one also works well in regular doorways.  it fits snug and the tension points are well above base molding, which helps to secure a tight even fit.
My son absolutely loves these pacifiers! He was given one in the hospital and wont take any other pacifier! I wish they were sold in stores like walmart so I could buy them instead of ordering them online but definitely worth the money.
i love these bibs! we have several of the larger sizes for our toddler so when baby no.2 arrived, i bought some smaller ones to use when he starts solids. they wipe up easy and last forever! super cute designs too! well worth the price.

Awesome! My newborn loves it. Even though he couldn't hold it when I got it. You can rest it so baby doesn't lose it as easily. Now he pushes it into his mouth and holds it in the crook of his arm and he's 8 weeks old. Recommend highly.
Great little pacifier purse.  Keep your pacifier from becoming dirty or lost with this brightly colored, pleasing patterned pacifier purse.  Love the fact that you'll find it in a deep dark bag due to the colorful stripes.  Works great!
this thing is amazing!!!!!!! i bought this instead of a high chair. and we are soooo happy we did!! we love it and i would recommend it to anyone who needs a booster/high chair for their baby!!! save your money and buy one of these!!! :)
my grandsons loves bring up and about in this...had to get 2 they are twins, easy to clean and adjust. my daughter and i used them to travel from new jersey to florida it worked perfectly through the airport and in flight...a great buy!!
Works just as expected and my boy loves it.  It keeps him pacified when he's asleep and it stays close so when he wakes up he can easily reach for it.  Wish they made them with older kid pacifiers to prevent any teeth development issues.
love this stroller, it makes life so much easier! i had the chicco lightweight with my son and decided to buy the plus so would fit my daughters car seat! it is so easy to use and isn't huge! best stroller ever! chicco never disappoints!
Bought this when son was 2 months and he didn't know what to do with it. Now at 4 months he adores this. He pops the soothie in and out of his mouth- kind of like a game to him haha. The giraffe is super soft and lays right on his chest.
i ordered these for thank you notes for my wedding gifts. they are very simple, but that's what i wanted. the envelopes are a tight fit, but they do fit. i only wish the box they come in had a way to close. it comes in a box with no lid.
MY SON LOVES LOVES LOVES THESE They are softer than the ones from WALMART. They are bendy, and he is 5 months now, but took them well since he was born. I love the cut out so it doesn't cover his nose, like the old ones from the hospital
the washcloths arrived very quickly, i was so surprised!  they are of great quality (not super thin so shouldn't wear out anytime soon).  the best part is that they are so wonderfully soft.  my son loves them!  they are a great addition.
my  16 month baby walks around the house for half an hour every morning and night &#34;brushing his teeth&#34; seems to feel good on his sore gums and he must like the taste of the tooth gel. i will definitely buy again when it runs out.
i am very pleased with this product. we bought this to aide in caring for an alzheimer's patient. we had purchased another unit, different brand, & had to return it due to poor color & picture quality. great video quality & zoom feature.
Love love love these pacifiers. The orthodontic shape is important for oral development and I am so happy with these! Wish they came in more colors though. Hold up great in dishwasher and in microwave steam sanitizer bags. Great product!
You guys are lifesavers.  The stuffed Serta sheep are my dog's favorite and the only toy she'll chew.  You filled the order promptly and didn't charge me an arm and a leg for shipping.  What more could a boy and his dog ask for?  Thanks.
this toy dances and has great music, so my baby loves it!  it's one of the few toys that will actually hold her attention, although you have to keep pressing the button repeatedly to make it play music and dance.  it's really a cute toy!
These are the ONLY pacifiers my son has ever truly liked, and I have tried a number of different types, shapes, and brands with him. They are awesome, and I know my son also thinks so because these are the only pacifiers he wont spit out.
these were lifesavers in the first couple of weeks of breastfeeding. i wish i'd known about them when i had my first child. they are cool and soothing, while protecting cracked nipples from chafing against the inside of your bra or shirt.
These were too big for my baby's mouth at first but by 3 months it is his pacifier of choice. My baby is breast fed and does not usually take a pacifier. But at night he will or if he needs soothing in the car and this one does the trick!
I love how soft and cuddly this giraffe is. My 5 month old loves to hold something soft when she's got her thumb, or a soother in her mouth and this checks both the boxes! Eliminates the need to carry a soother AND a small blanket or toy.
With the wubbanub we never lost the pacifier again.  It is cute, durable, extremely light weight and we received loads of compliments.  Would have been great and cute to have had multiple wubbanubs stashed around the house and diaper bag!
Glow in the dark make them easy to find  in the middle  of  night. MAM is a great brand, the silicone nipple is just the right size for my small newborn, other  brands like nuk, and Playtex  just simply don't work, and don't feel natural.
I just got this paci for my 3 month old son and he loves it! In the picture shown here it looks like the wings are kind of a purple color, they are actually a really bright vibrant blue, which I like better, it was a nice little surprise.
Bought this little bear for my baby because she was having a hard time keeping the soothie in her mouth without someone holding it. She sleeps with it at night and even when she doesn't use the paci she falls asleep cuddling it! So CUTE!!
Our baby loves these pacifiers.  It was a little frustrating that regular pacifier clips didn't work, but they have an ingenious solution.  We also purchased the glow in the dark model -- a life saver for middle of the night retrievals!!!
i love the cloud b sleep sheep, but got his because my godson's theme was jungle animals.  turns out it fits easily in the stroller or bassinet, and then could be used later in the crib.  now his &#34;raffi&#34; is his favorite sleep toy!
I bought a BinkiBear as a gift for a baby shower and the mom to be loved it!!!    It is super soft and the perfect size for little hands.  I wish this would have been around when my kids were younger!    You won't be disappointed!!!!!!!!!
love these bibs.  they're a must-have once your little one starts feeding herself.  i would've been changing her clothes a lot more often with a traditional bib!  this catches all the milk she dumbs, food that falls out of her mouth, etc.
Seriously, I probably spent a fortune on these because my baby hated having a tether on them and these suckers can roll. It's quite amazing how far they can end up and in completely different directions then they initially bounced off in.
Cute, durable, washable, and fits easily into little hands. Also, very difficult to lose! I get a lot of compliments on these and own 3 total. To wash, I place in wash machine on cold setting, no detergent or baby detergent, then air dry.

perfect size and thickness for my toddler. he's not used to sleeping on a pillow yet (up to this point, he's been just resting his head flat on the mattress), however as soon as he gets the hang of pillow sleeping, i'm sure he'll love it.
We bought this to keep my son from launching his pacifier across the room when he ejected it.  It is cute and at 3 months, he likes to stroke the kitty's head and sometimes grabs the ears.  Sometimes he puts the kitty's foot in his mouth.
I really like the pacifier, however it is a little big for my 5 month old. He is almost 20 lbs, so he is bigger and it is still too much for him. I am anxious for him to grow in to it because I am very happy with the pacifier and quality.
Our dtr used her WubbaNub for over a year. It was perfect from newborn, where it helped keep the binkie in place, to when she was older so she could find the binkie and put it back in her mouth. I recommend this to everyone with newborns!
Love these pacifiers, after my friends seen them they all wanted them too. I like that they dont go the whole way up to the babies nose like the ones from the hospital, and thier much softer. As for the vanilla scent it wears off quickly.
Our baby loves his WubbaNubs. We have the giraffe and elephant and he loves to cuddle them as the pacifier soothes him to sleep. We also have the regular soothies but found that the WubbaNubs stay in his mouth better. Definitely recommend!
This was just too cute to pass up. I purchased this for my nephew. This will be his first Wubbanub, but I already foresee that he will be getting many more of these from me or from others. I'm pretty sure he will have quite the collection.
Our twin boys have only ever used Mam pacifiers.  They LOVE them!  Now that they are 6 months old and teething, I needed to buy the next size.  Well...I received the pink ladybug set!  There really needs to be a gender selection available.
i use this bag all the time. it's got plenty of room and plenty of pockets without being overwhelming and losing too many things. i've only used it for two months, so i haven't experienced any wear and tear yet. i would recommend this bag.
We love NUK because they seem to be the only style of pacifier that will stay in newborns mouths for more than 5 seconds. I also love that they come in multiple sizes to grow with babies who have a hard time dropping the habit as newborns.
We all love this! Daughter likes to hold monkey's paw even when not using the soothie.  Friends and family think its such a cute idea.  I was little worried about price but she enjoys it so much! The monkey is well constructed and so soft.
There are a few companies who make the Gumdrop pacifier and this one is the best. It is the most flexible, soft and lightweight. If your child cant keep the soothie in, get these! I used these until my daughter got the hang of her soothie.
I bought this as a gift and I couldn't be happier. It is very well made and too cute!! My daughter was tickled to get this for her new foster baby and the baby loves it. It also came very fast!! I will definitely buy more of this product!!
love our amber necklace. seems to really work and besides it's absolutely adorable on my son!! the colors are awesome! he has been wearing it for about 4 months now. i put it around his ankle at night instead of leaving it around his neck.
We got this WubbaNub as a gift for a friend who recently had a baby.  We used a couple of WubbaNub when my son was younger.  He loved them.  As your baby gets older he will be able to find it easily in his crib to comfort himself at night.
The only ones I can find easily during those 3 am &#34;Binky emergencies&#34; on the table, floor or wherever it may have fallen. Actually helped my daughter find it herself to make her more independent and sleep through the night as well!
My son likes this pacifier much more than the traditional style ones.  He can grip it, take it out of his mouth, and even put it back in.  He's had it for two months.  He just turned 4months and it looks he'll get a lot more use out of it.
We ordered this product specifically for the type of pacifier it had but found that the combination was excellent.  My grandson loves his so much we had to buy a second one so we could wash the original one once in a while.<br />Thank you!
These are great for on the go healthy snacks. I was buying the brand name fruit pouches but realized how much money if save making them myself! I'm happy I found these little green pouches, my son loves the homemade apple sauce I make him!
i got the mirror very fast. the quality is very good, but what i like the most is that it is easy to install it on the rear mirror. it is big enough to see everything on the back of my truck and side roads. i really recommend this product.
came just as advertised.  My son loves his monkey and his dog.  Wouldn't take any other type of pacifier.  He is always carrying it around by the monkey/tail.  Have had no problems with these for the past 11 months and he still loves them.
i am a fan of tommee tippee and am disappointed my youngest doesnt care for the nipple. however my oldest loves them and they have stood up to her usage for almost 2 years. i recommend these to any breast feeding moms switching to bottles.
i have two lean little boys, who had a constant problem with &#34;droopy bottoms&#34;. the dapper snapper was a perfect solution. it helps keep their pants up with out having to be unbuckled every time i change their diapers. great design!
The infant soothie pacifier is the only pacifier my LO has taken to since she first had one in the hospital.  They are safe and are all one piece.  Solid and sturdy. Much easier to buy online than to hunt down in stores   Highly recommend.
I loved these pacifiers more and more as my baby got older. He used it regularly as a newborn, and as he started teething he would turn it sideways and chew on the side, which can't be done with a paci that has a hard plastic curved piece.
i love this monitor. the picture and night vision is awesome. the sound is great too. i used velchro and attatched it to my daughters crib. i can walk around and clean the house and still be able to see her while she is napping. i love it!
you're going to love these blankets! the softest swaddle blankets out there. love the simple and muted patterns. consider getting two packages. we ended up keeping one in the car, one in the baby bag, one in the stroller... just love them!
we are very happy with this bag. lots of compartments and space, and great quality. the bag is also very stylish and not too girly. overall very pleased with all aspects of this diaper bag. we would definitely purchase another jj cole bag.
worked great, i just wish that i'd ordered them sooner.  it's really helpful that you get 3 sizes in the pack.  at different times, i would use all three sizes.  much more comfortable than the standard shields that came with my medela pump.
great toy for baby even before they can roll around and move much. just know there is no cushion on that fabric bit, wouldn't reccomend use on hardwood floor without some sort of extra padding underneath. still an awesome toy none the less.
Daughter loved these from when she was an infant!  They are very durable and last for as long as you have them (until they are lost or the dog eats them ;))<br /><br />Definitely recommended!  After these, she wouldn't entertain any others!
it's cute and perfect for glamping our camper, shabby chic. it is small and still a little sparkly enough for what i need.<br />had to go with a plugin, no switch for hard wire.  the only problem, it only came with one bulb not 3 as stated.
I have tried just about every pacifier on the market. Not to fond of the Nuk and Nuby because of the two piece assembly, I love the one piece pacifiers. These are great because they're one piece and very soft. I won't use any other one now!
my new go to baby gift! i bought my daughter the hippo and she loved it so much i bought this sweet lamb for my niece. the stuffed animal is so soft and the book is adorable. i also bought the spotted dog for a cousins baby. love these sets
My granddaughter loves her Wubbanubs.  She has three of them and my daughter keeps them in the crib.  When she wakes up at night she feels around for one of them and it helps her go back to sleep.  My daughter gets more sleep this way also.
My 5mo is able to grab the kitten and play with it and use the pacifier. She is pretty picky about pacifiers, so far this is the only one she seems interested in.  I think she likes the kitten more than the pacifier! Definitely worth a try.
I purchased this binkie as a joke for my hubby.. He constantly is looking for my daughters pacifiers and refers to them as her mute button, so when i saw this paci.. I HAD TO GET IT.. Right now it hangs on a ribbon on our rear view mirror..
sturdy and strong! can be used for a baby just learning to sit or can't sit as the back of the chair reclines. also the tray table moves forward and back as baby gets bigger. the chair cover can easily come of for washing as well, i love it
I tried going through all of the other pacifiers, including the soothies. Brought these home to him and he took to them instantly and they didn't seem to get spit out easily. I love the translucence too because you can see more of his face.
i bought this for college, not for a nursery and it is great. the drawers are perfect for small things, and the shelves are sturdy enough to not have to worry about them bending. arrived in fine packaging and wasn't late. overall very nice!
This has to be my favorite one, by far.  I just love this little dragon.  These WubbaNub's hold up very well. We have had this one for a year now and it is still in perfect condition even after many washes and being terrorized by a baby. :)
I have been very impressed with every Avent product that I have purchased.  I have found these pacifiers to be so nice.  They are completely clear and you are able to see smiles around them.  My baby LOVES hers.  We can't live without them.
My grandson already has one and I bought one just &#34;incase&#34;.  Thank good ness I did, because it temporarily got lost, so its good to have an extra.....also when washing one you have another one to use.  He loves his &#34;binkie&#34;!
I love this product for newborns.  If your baby takes a pacifier they can also hold onto something so incase it slips out of there mouths they do not fall on the floor that quickly.  They are easy to clean as well.  They are also very cute!
i needed a quick gift for the godmother and it was very high quality for the price. it is beautiful and i personalized it more by printing out my own photo and gave her the frame with the photo in it. i would buy again for another godmother.
i love this pacifier! i had to boil it for quite some time to get the funky smell off.. then i sanitized it.. it arrived quickly, great price!! i am very happy with it! my husband fell in love with it too! i can't tell you how cute it looks!
These are hands down the best pacifiers for breastfed infants! My daughter would accept any other type of brand. I don't understand why they are so expensive on Amazin though because you can get 2 for $5.50 at stores like Target and Walmart.
Love these pacifiers! My sons chin will break out from rash from any other pacifier when he sleeps, because he drools. Also you still get to see the smile. Can't believe all pacifiers aren't made With this air design, at least for 6+ Months.
After I got this bottles I never used any other bottles for already 3 month. So easy to clean and my little one loves it too. I'm not sure if this is because of this bottles, but my baby doesn't have any colic from the day I start to use it.
My daughter developed a 'binky' rash for many months.  I switched her to these and it went away within a week.  Water seldomly gets in the nipple, i clean it well and replace them as is recommended with pacifiers.  These really are the best!
my baby loves these! can always find her paci in crib at night. helps to self soothe so we don't have to get up and find it for her. even when she is not sucking on it she cuddles w it. we have two. we also stick in freezer for her teething.
My daughter absolutely loves these things.  Pretty steap price for a pacifier but she loves them.  One for the mouth and two more to stick her index finger into the binky. She is 2 yrs old and i have had a supply of these around since birth.
This was a great gift to give for baby shower as it had everything a new mommy will need. all the products included are useful and the quality is very nice and soft.will help out in getting prepared for the bundle of joy. my friend loved it!
Best place to get is here on amazon, I've looked! These have a smaller outer plastic than traditional avent paci and allow more air. I tried several different brands but Avent are the only ones she likes. Thank you for the calm nights! Haha!
i love this product. i recently had twins and i use them for every diaper change. its machine washable and has been able to withstand multiple washes for a few months now with no sign of damage. i have about 8-10 of these and they are great.
my niece has tried many pacifiers but this one is her favorite. she is only 6 mons old but has developed a likeliness for this particular paci, so much so that she refuses to take any other. great product and a lifesaver , as my sister says.
my son loves the MAM pacifiers.  they are the only ones he will use.  i've tried other brands, but continue to go back to these.  same thing with  my twin girls.  they turned every other pacifier away.  all three of my kids loved their MAMs.
My son is 4 months old and he loves this blanket. He like to hold on to things while hes using his pacifier and it makes him feel comfortable. I love how it has the pacifier holder and teething corners. I would suggest this to anyone. Thanks
i've begun using this instead of the giant genie.  each stinky diaper is safely sealed and thrown away.  i've hung it above the trashcan for convenience.  i've got one in the diaper bag too.  it really helps with my older son's pull ups too.
Super easy to wash as you can just throw it in the washing machine!  My 11 month old son cannot sleep with out this!  And bonus, now that he's older if he wakes up at night, he feels around his crib for this monkey and can put it in himself.
i love these! im so glad i got the blue ones too. it said color may vary and i was worried i would end up with a girl color. i have other pacifiers i received as gifts but so far i think these are the best. its so cool they glow in the dark.
My little guy would take any pacifier - still does BUT couldn't keep any of the other pacifiers for long bc they were pretty heavy.  This one is amazingly light and easy for LO to keep in their mouth themselves which keeps us new moms sane :)
For a special needs baby who needed the extra girth of the attached puppy to find his pacifier! perfect solution!! Puppy is much lighter than you'd think, however.  I thought the weight of the puppy would be able to sit on his chest for ease.
Fast shipping.  When my daughter was born, they brought her in the hospital room with a binkie in her mouth.  Couldn't find them in the stores around here and this brand was the only one that she would take.  Amazon had them.  Thanks so much!
Was what we used when our daughter was newborn up to 3 months, then transitioned her to Nuk brand. With the Avent soothies we did not have nipple confusion. She did have a hard time keeping it in her mouth though, so they seem slightly heavy.
I. Love. This. Product. I was nursing my 2 week old endlessly, playing the human pacifier, and had tried another newborn pacifier without much luck. Got this for my little guy and he already loves it! My nipples and sanity thank you wubbanub.
my son started chewing on his crib like a typical and i purchased these because i needed to cover his crib rails. and they have been washed and chewed on and washed again. and they are still in great condition. and they were at a great price.
my 3 month old son loves this mobile.  i only purchased it from the reviews and everyone was right!  entertains him for 30 mins while i get the eight zillion other things done that need tending to around the house.  it's 100% worth the money.
i was expecting them to be in different colors, but white will do. these were supposed for children, not adults. i mean i have read the descriptions and reviews, i'm not complaining. now i'm using these for my scarfs and belts; they are good!
previous bath toys were getting old and yukky, so these cute, colorful and soft bath toys were just the right bath companions for the grandkids. they enjoy playing with these sassy toys in the tub at bathtime. highly recommended for all kids.
love this drying rack. it's adorable, uses very little space, spins to stack baby bottles and such, and it's also very affordable. it is one of my favorite baby items. everytime i use it, i think about how happy i am that i have purchased it.
this item is great.  i am glad that i purchased it.  my son is just coming up to 12 months and already eats on his own.  this spoon allows him to eat properly and the food goes straight into his mouth.  i would definitely recommend this item.
my god son will not use another paci! He loves it and to boot it has been almost a year my dogs ripped the pacifier part so we cut it off and My god Son still snuggles with the Plush toy, Thank you for such a good purchase! i bought 3 more :)
Our changing table is short so it was nice to find this 30&#34; (as opposed to 32&#34;+) pad. Has attachments for the changing table so it won't slide off. Has worked just fine for us through two babies. No signs of wear or holes or anything.
Life-saver!  Those nuk pacifiers drop and roll away, usually under something heavy. Problem solved with the wubanub. Easy to grip for little hands, and to clean.  There are many styles available so shop for one on sale - don't pay full price!
This particular wubbanub is very soft and has remained that way after multiple cycles through the washing machine. It has not pilled like other animals we have. It stays put on my child and can easily be strapped into bouncy seat or stroller.
We love these binkies, they are the only ones my baby takes. They don't create pressure on the palette, and they're cute. My only complaint is that the paint scratches very easily. But, because of the benefits we will keep using them happily.
this seat attachment is great!  we bought it as an addition to a double stroller we recently bought for our twin girls.  it is super easy to install and remove, and small enough to toss into the back of the car without taking up tons of space.
Love love love wubbaNub! My twins love them and so do I! Easy to find in the middle of the night when the baby is crying and you are dead tired! We have about six of these now and my twins are 3 months old and love grabbing the little animals!
just received and installed the easy close metal gate.  was extremely impressed with how easy it was to install and especially how durable it is.  i especially like the gate opener mechanism, not one that a child could easily work.  well done!
we were contemplating getting a baby bullet but had read some bad reviews. we purchased this based on all the rave reviews and we were not disappointed. it's easy to use, clean and its compact size doesn't take up too much room in the kitchen.
these are the only prefolds i have ever tried so i have nothing to compare them too but i really like them! my son is one and we're still using them to stuff and line his other diapers. i prefer these to most of the other diapers that we have!
My son is a Natursutten pacifier junkie, and I just ordered the new butterfly style, and he loves them as much as the original!<br /><br />These also double as a fabulous teether. The texture and the density are perfect for soothing sore gums.
When my neighbor showed up with a pink pacifier I knew I couldn't be outdone with my lil girl. I immediately signed on to amazon & furiously searched for a pink pacifier. This thing didn't fail me @ all! It's so pink & suckable my baby is hip!
got this for my baby girl who was 5 mos at the time. she loves all the toys it came with. others on the market have less and want more. wroth every penny. easy to put tougher took me about 20 to 30 mins. will buy again for baby shower or gift.
My first daughter used Nuk pacis but I had to buy a different brand for my new baby as per my pediatrician's recommendation so as not to confuse her. These are great. They fit well in his mouth, he can hold it easily, and the designs are cute.
This binky is adorable! I paired it with the Disguise - L'Vampire Halloween Costume (12-18 months). My son used it a few times afterwards (mostly playing). It's heavier than a normal paci, so I would recommend it for older babies and toddlers.
we used this constantly when our little one discovered that they could wriggle out of swaddles, but were still too small to have their arms loose at night.  when baby could roll over we simply popped the arm snaps open and continued to use it.
These are the pacifiers you get at the hospital.  I love these pacifiers.  I purchase them for all my friends who are having kids and they love them. Ive used only these for my kids and they loved them.  I wouldn't use any other pacifier ever.
It was a pain in the butt to try and find my daughter pacifier at night. But when I learned they had a glow in the dark pacifier I thought would it hold its glow all night?! And it did. I was surprised and happy. Great buy for us. We love mam!
from the moment we gave it to him our son has happily chewed on this rubber toothbrush. he's very interested in watching and imitating us when we brush our teeth, and this teether does the job of starting him on that habit. highly recommended.
This is a darling little lamb and a great concept.  It's a little smaller than I had envisioned but truly the perfect size for a little one to hold on to.  It shipped very quickly too.  So if my niece likes it, you can bet I'll be buying more!
this toy has been so much fun this summer. have brought it to the pool many times and had a blast. bath time has gotten messy but fun! my son is 15 months old, and cannot fill it with water but has no problem pushing it out if i hold the squid.
the playtex diaper genie products are wonderful. my purchases were made from a gift registry on amazon.  the travel genie and its' refills what a blessing.  much better than the &#34;good ole days&#34; of hauling and dunking cloth diapers!!!!!!
ive only had these pouches a wk and i love them! i blend up my baby food and freeze it in ice trays. stick some frozen cubes in a pouch when we are on the go and she loves them. also very easy to clean in dishwasher. hope they last a long time!
great baby carrier, the mesh really helps keep you cooler.<br /><br />the 4 adjustable straps make for a perfect fit, which helps save your back from pain.  i can carry my baby around in this for a long time as it distributes the weight evenly.
i use these little guys to freeze spicy garden produce that i would want in small quantities: hot peppers, roasted garlic, hot onions, etc.  they are perfect.  they are not stable when stacked, but just put them in a basket or larger container.
These are really great. Daughter loves them. The only thing is that a little water gets in it when you wash them, but I think that happens with all pacifiers. They are cute and do the trick. They don't leave a mark on the face like the Nuks do.
My son loves Mam pacifier and refused other brand I've tried. He is now over 3 months and I have a bigger size 2+months. The nipple is the same size like 0-3 months size, only the front part (I call it butterfly) is bigger. He likes both sizes.
I received two WubbaNub's at my baby shower. My son & I both loved them. So, as a gift for a friends baby shower, I ordered the caterpillar from Amazon. It's so cute for a baby girl! It arrived quicker than expected & was exactly what I wanted.
love that this company makes an effort for non-toxic toys, very well made teether. also really love that these can be put in the freezer as there are not a lot of non-toxic options that are freezable! hope to see more products from this company
I purchased this for my daughter as my 15 month old grandson did not like his temperature being taken. This thermometer works great. I can't say my grandson now loves having his temperature taken but this makes the chore much easier and quicker
I literally have probably 10 of these lying around the house at all times. A nurse had given me one in the hospital with him and I immediately bought more. Unfortunately my dogs love them too so I have to keep buying more but these are amazing!
Every parent should own one of these, unless you enjoy the process of getting up repeatedly all night to replace your baby's pacifier. We give one to all our friends when they have a baby, and several have gone on to buy many more of their own.
Absolutely love this.  Bought a changing table from a big retail store that needed a pad.  Bought this and it fits perfectly.  Also bought the changing pad washable covers and I feel very comfortable when changing my daughter (and so does she).
I wanted to surprise my daughter and son in-in-law with these pacifiers for my newborn grandson, because they are major White Sox Fans.  They thought they were so cute, that they're saving them for his memory box.  Great price for a great gift.
i am so happy with the purchase of my little pillow! my 15 month old son has been using his little pillow for a couple of weeks and seems to really like it. it is the perfect size. the best part of this purchase is the personal customer service.
I bought this lamp for my son's forest theme nursery.  It fits right in.  It is good quality and the colors look the same as in the picture.  It came with a light bulb which was a nice plus.  Long cord with switch.  Very happy with the purchase.
the glider i purchased is very comfortable.  the color is perfect and has alot of support for my back.  i like the idea that you can lock the rocker in place. shipping was perfect, no chips or broken pieces.  i was very pleased with my purchase.
Each baby is different, so I had to try many pacifiers to find some she liked.  Ultimately she liked the ones with the angled nipple.  I especially love that this came with a cover to keep it clean when I need to throw a spare in the diaper bag.
Our favorite wubbanub animal. This one is great for our baby who sleeps with her head turned to the side. We can prop the tiger up so that the paci doesn't slip out as easily. It lays flat on her chest well, too. It also has a nice weight to it.
I don't leave home without this. This is &#34;dad's secret weapon&#34; when baby gets fussy and I keep it holstered in my back pocket. We liked it so much because the stuffed animal allows you to place it in a position that stays in baby's mouf.
great bottles!  i handwash the nipples because one discolored from our water in the dishwasher.  i put them through a microwave sterilizer afterwards (we have well water so we have to use boiled water or sterilize to kill any possible bacteria).
i got this sham as a christmas gift for my sister. it's a sew-it-yourself gift and i knew that she liked to sew, and that she liked superheroes so this was a perfect pick. it's been a few years since then and she still has it so it must be good.
I've always gotten the wubbanub pacifiers but the monkey is by far my favorite.  The weight of the monkey helps keep it in an infants mouth and when they get older they can find them easily in the night.  Super great product and prompt delivery.
my daughter loves these type of sippy cups and she is very picky about what kind she uses because she refuses to take bottles.  i love how i got different colors too and how they were cheaper here than in the store.  plus super fast shipping!!!!
we love this blanket.  we've been using it every night for the past several weeks for our son who is three months old now.  it is easy to wrap and effective in keeping his arms from startling him during sleep.  very happy to have purchased this.
my son is a new dad and just loves this backpack/diaper bag! he keeps it ready to go in his truck...just in case!  it's well built and is just the right size to fit all the basics...and he doesn't have to carry a \\feminine\\ looking diaper bag!
I first thought this was a silly idea, but it has been wonderful. Baby holds the elephant and the elephant holds the pacifier in place, plus is big enough you can find it if it is dropped.  Get 2 - one for the car or diaper bag and one for home.
We recieved this as a gift off of our registry at Target and we love this bear.  It is very cute and cuddly and is not imposing in the crib.  The adjustable volume and automatic shutoff is also nice.  Hands down one of our favorite shower gifts.
love these pacifiers.  they are the perfect size and my little one loves them.  we have bought 6 total (yep we loose them constantly) and don't have any complaints.  its nice to know that baby is sucking on something natural rather than plastic.
My baby will suck on almost any paci, but I can tell that he likes this kind the best.  He keeps this one in the longest and will fall asleep with this one.  He also likes to chew on the opposite side.  I believe that it feels goods on his gums.
Prevents paci from rolling into the land of nowhere. Saved my sanity when my babies were about 6months old.  Now that they are almost 1, they love the little animal.  My son will not use an ordinary paci to go to sleep. Had to buy some back ups!

My grandson received a set of these when he was born. His parents and I loved them. They do help prevent colic and are very easy to clean and sterilize. I bought a set for use at my house when he is here. I wish I had them when my son was small.
good price.....obviously, if you are buying these, you know what you are looking for so a &#34;review&#34; isn't entirely necessary....these are the type that we've always received from the hospital at birth, but for the next step beyond newborn.
I really like this particular brand of pacifiers. They are my son's favorite. This brand has pacifiers 0-3, 0-6 and 6+ but I did not know that initially and got a few packs of 0-3 as we lose them constantly. Now I would just get 0-6 and later 6+.
on the recent holiday we had friends over, she took &#34;everyone&#34; upstairs to see her room (it brought me great joy). the only thing i would prefer is if the sheets were a soft cotton. for the warmer months i'll have to find matching sheets.
Love it. Soft and adorable. My daughter had it when she was small and even at one now, she still uses it like a lovey. It's easy for her to find at night when she wakes and fits perfectly in her small hands. I buy it for all my new mommy friends.
i am have extremely fair skin so sunburn is nothing new to me. this aloe cream is the best product i have ever used. i did not peal at all and my burn healed within three days. i will never use anything else on a sunburn. this product is amazing!
My 16 month old loves this paci. He has been using it since birth. He refuses any other one....it's a shame these are not made in bigger sizes! It is easy to wash. I love that it only has one piece and as such there is no risk of parts detaching.
My baby loved these particular pacifiers compared to others. The plastic on the rim part is very hard, the sucking portion is medium-soft silicone and the pacifiers have a ring on them so you can easily move them around / strap them to something.
love this stuff for my cloth dipaers. i use as preventative before i get an ammonia stink that some of my fellow cd mama's complain of. i use this packet in clean diapers every three months and never have had an absorbance issue or ammonia stink.
Can't wait for my twins to use these, haven't received them yet..but I'm sure I'll love them, I ordered the monkey and giraffe.<br />Absolutely LuV them..life savers..my babies hug them and wrestle with them..so cute. Definitely gonna order more.
my 6 year old loves the color, texture and actually uses it for its intended purposes! discreet, pretty and functional! highly recommended! i got the punchy pink for my 8 year old and was surprised that it glows in the dark! we love this product!
In addition to pacifier wipes, I used these for quick cleanup on breast pump parts.  Basically the same thing as the cleaning wipes that are sold specifically for pumps, but they are smaller so they last longer  they are also much less expensive!
We love wubbanubs! The only thing I don't like about it is after your child grows out of this stage of paci you Can't switch it out and you can't detach the pacifier to wash the stuffed animal part in the washer. Its kind of sad throwing it away.
We are huge john deere fans but just beware they do not have bulbs on  the end to help the baby keep it in their mouth and they many not take any other binky. But on that note they are perfect for nursing babies as they are more natural in shape.
This is by far the cutest wubbanub my son has. We have used these since he's been home from the hospital and he loves them. They seem to be very strong to his teething and biting and super easy to just throw in the wash with clothes on hot water.
this thing is awesome. i love it, my husband loves it, and my daughter is so much happier going into her carseat now that we have this. it is lined with a cozy sherpa fleece and has a durable outer layer. i can't say enough about how sweet it is.
Great paci. Our son has loved this since he was an infant. We liked that he could find it if it fell out in the middle of the night.<br /><br />Only bad thing is that he's super attached to &#34;Monk&#34; and will be a difficult habit to break :)
it is a great quality product. the water does not leak from the bottle which is a problem i have when i have the bottles in the diaper bag. the best part is the price. sometimes you buy high end bottles and the babies don't even like the nipples.
Might seem a little pricey for a pacifier but you'll spend twice that amount replacing pacifiers that you're lost. You won't lose these because they don't pop out of the baby's mouth and fall on the floor. Easy to find in the diaper bag or purse.
These soothe my baby, so I love them. I wash by hand and haven't had any problems yet. Nice that it comes with a little clear plastic cover that snaps over the nipple part, since these tend to attract fuzz, however one cover broke fairly quickly.
my granddaughter wanted a pink hamper with peace signs on it.  she had not seen one but that' s what she wanted.  so i googled it  and i found it and ordered it and she loved it.  just what she wanted she said.  so a very happy little girl i had.
i love these pacifiers. their just like the ones you recieve in the hospital but these ones have a nose whole that i like. the kids like these and heir easy to attach to a holder because the ends in the front have a whole so you can loop it thru.
I bought this with the princess paci clip as part a a twin cess baby gift..they better in person. Since this is a gift for twin I bought 2 extra in case they loose one... I only saw these one other place on the Internet so  they make a unique gift
this is in my son's room and he loves it. we have it hanging lower so that he can reach it and put his animals in and out by himself. it is a good quality and is lasting us for a long time. it is great for keeping stuffed animals off of the floor.
This is the paci that my baby was given in the hospital and the only one she will still take.  I had to order more just in case we ever lost the one and I love Amazon because shopping with a baby isn't very easy...awesome product, awesome service.
We love all the wubanub pacis.  My baby, a preemie by two months, has loved the monkey wubanub since he was around 4 months. he is now 10 months old and it is a critical part of his bedtime routine.    I bought this elephant as a baby shower gift.
the shade of grey is very delicate, and the fabric is nice and soft. i haven't used it yet. been too warm outside, but this will be great for fall and spring. i will use a down bag for the winter. yes, i live in the north where it gets very cold:)
Love love love these!!!!!! They are worth every penny.  Used them for my now 2 1/2 year old as well and are using them for my 6 month old.  Gives them something to grab on to. Gives you something more to catch when they start to fall. Love them!!!
i installed these before my son could walk and he (so far) doesn't really mess with them.  i am hoping that he never tries too hard to get inside them.  i figure if i never show interest then he might just leave them alone.  they work as expected.
Only thing that my picky baby would take.  She's 100% breast milk fed, but will take it from a bottle.  However she wouldn't touch a paci until we find this.  She had a tongue tie revised and a significant upper lip tie - maybe related, maybe not.
I bought these for a friend that was decorating her nursery in a John Deere themed room. When she saw them she thought they were the cutest things ever for a baby and kept wondering how I ever found them and I told her that I had my sources. haha.
i bought several dif. brands of containers, and finally found the winner! i love the lids. no leaks ever. easy on and off. and they are so cute! the daycare teachers love them. lol. i'm now addicted to oxo! all their products are great and modern.
what a great teether.  my daughter gravitates towards this teether over all others.  i think she likes the head nubs and nose on her gums.  plus it is so cute to watch her &#34;eating&#34; such an adorable giraffe!  will be buying these for gifts!
These pacifiers are AWESOME! They do indeed glow in the dark and boy do they glow! My daughter is 6 months and constantly loses her pacifier in the night resulting in me having to zombie out of bed to find it for her! But now she finds it herself!
It's awesome.  Come on, it's a pacifier that makes your baby look like a vampire.  What's not to love?  It seems to be pretty sturdy and well made.  If your kiddo insists on wandering around with a pacifier, this one makes things more fun for mom!
My daughter has loved pacifiers since she was born and these Mam are the only ones she will keep in her mouth. These have saved my life in more ways than one and I'm constantly purchasing more as my daughter looses hers. I love the design as well.
my daughter wants more for their baby. it keeps her neck dry when breast or bottle feeding and it is comfortable for mother and baby. i wish these were around when i had babies.  i hated the milk pooling around their necks.  a must for every baby.
we purchased this for our 4 month old daughter and she loved it, she's currently 5 months and is sitting up like a big girl and playing! we love it, it fits anywhere and everywhere, as well as easy to transport when she spends time with grandma :)
we had been using a standard blanket for picnics but if the ground was damp or full of debris then we were sure to have problems. this blanket is very nice. fold and stores easily. its large size accommodates the average family and it wipes clean.
Came just as advertised. With these pacifiers I have had times where I get different images on the MAM pacifiers than have been shown on the product page images, but this one was accurate. We love MAM pacifiers. They are all we buy for our babies.
I bought my son of of these just to keep his pacifier handy. He doesn't actually use his pacifier...it's more of a teething toy. He Loves the bink link...he could care less about the pacifier, he's all about the bink link...ordering a second one..
a gift for a family member who was very pleased the assembly<br />was not complicated. she loves the crimson color because she<br />can pick out her stroller easily when all the black topped ones<br />clutter the hallway-<br /><br />great product!
bought it for my son and daughter-in -law and our new grand daughter . kids love it it with the removable car seat, and baby carrier. they also like the hood over the baby carrier. they use the stroller daily on walks. over all a very good system.
This was the pacifier that was given to our daughter, while in the hospital. We tried pther pacifiers, but she just did not like them, so we just had to buy some. We love the cut out for her little nose and how durable they are! Love this product!
our little fellow has enjoyed this toy greatly.... he especially likes the mirror [super fun for making faces at, crooning to, and mouthing] and the clicking, moveable triangle teethers. he uses this to this day to chew as his teeth slowly emerge.
My second son spent some time in the NICU.  He was given this because it made it easier to keep the pacifer in his mouth.  We took it home, and it works well.  I doubt we'll be using it as much as a a regular pacifer, but for newborns it's awesome
I got the 6-18 months for my 3 month old and he didn't quite like it but he really likes this one. He was used to the soothie before and took this one easily. Its great that it comes with a cap to keep it clean and taking it along when you go out.
These are wonderful to have around not only to clean the pacifier but also to clean my 5 month old's hands when we are out and about. She is constantly putting her hands in her mouth so I love having a something on hand that I know is safe for her.
I purchased the Natursutten BPA free Natural Rubber Pacifier because it is all rubber, BPA free & thought it would make a great chew-toy for my great-grandson. He does not use a pacifier of any kind, but loves to chew rubbery items. He loves it! :)
My baby will take no other pacifier!  The hospital gave us this one, and she LOVES it!  I have tried the gumdrop pacifiers because they are supposedly the same nipple as these, but she spits those out.  She instantly calms down with theis pacifier.
I was down to two pacifiers that my son hadn't chewed up yet, found this to be the best deal. Got here supper fast (upgraded prime to one day shipping for just a few dollars, cheaper than a gallon of gas to get to the store). And my son loves them!
These were the only pacifiers my daughter could use because she was so tiny when she was born! The traditional pacifiers have such a wide nipple that it wouldn't fit in her mouth! Perfectly pink. Will definitely use with all my future children too!
i love these. got one for my now 3 year old and she used it for forever. it helped keep the pack in her mouth and later she just loved it for the animal. bought this one thinking my newest addition would enjoy it too but she's just not a pack baby.
LOVE!LOVE!LOVE! Have I mentioned that I love this product? My LO absolutely adores these pacifiers. IT is so cute and very soft. Easy for little fingers to hold on to making it less likely to fly on the floor. Highly recommend!! Must have product!!
I thought this was supposed to be a mute button for my cousin's infant but instead it's just a pacifier.  It is a very high quality, BPA-free pacifier, but I found if you really need to silence the baby it just takes a couple good shakes (kidding!)
Bought as a gag gift for an expecting friend. They loved it! Said it wasn't fully functional for baby in first few months because it is too long, but now they use it and it generates many laughs! In a gift basket for the expecting from here on out!
bought this as an extra changing table to put in our bedroom for our newborn. easy to put together & works great! it came with a flat changing pad, but i bought one of the thicker curved ones instead. i have no complaints about this changing table!
Bought as a gift for a friend because my son loved his puppy wubbanub. Every picture I see of their little girl she is cuddling with the little zebra. It is super cute in person! I love that it's not the popular ones you see at the big baby stores.
i really like that there are no suction cups on this shade. it is really easy to move around and seems to diffuse sunlight very well. you can see through the shades, but of course it is not like looking through window glass. i would recommend them!
Love these pacifiers! They appear not to allow as much moisture inside the nipple, which is why we were replacing the MAM ones we had. Hubby loves the sports theme and I can often find a coordinating pacifier while the two guys are watching a game.
i never believed inthe warmers until i got one of these. it's so simple to use. i use it daily and even bought another one fo rmy best friend she loves her. it quicky heats the water for my sons bottle. and what i loved was it shuts off by it'self.
My daughter LOVES these! She learned early on to find it on her own while sleeping. At one I took the pacifier away by cutting it off and it was a smooth transition because she was so used to the comfort of the kitten she forgot about the pacifier.
Unlike the other pacifiers these are so easy to keep clean. I hated the others where the silicone met with the plastic and attracted hair, lint, etc. in the crease. So hard to clean. So happy with this product and will always buy these from now on.
My son loves his wubba! I read some reviews about washing paci holder. It's not difficult. I just threw it in washing machine with his clothes and let it air dry!! Then I washed paci in sink with dish soap & problem solved!!!!!! Good as new!!!!!!!!
i bought this for my daughter & son-in-law & they love it, however, there was no manual or any instructions included in the box, which is kind of a pain as now we have to track them down online & print them so we know how to set it up & fold it up.
these bins are easy to assemble.  i ordered 12 of them for a wall of my playroom.  only 1 arrived with hardware missing.  customer service online was quick and easy and the hardware arrived quickly.  it's much easier to keep toys off the floor now.
For my baby shower I got around 8 different types of pacifiers...my newborn daughter wouldn't take any of them.  I asked my friend & she recommended this one.  Bought it recently at Baby's R Us, 2 pk for $4.99 and my baby will finally take it! Yay!
Favorite pacifier hands down. Very light weight and stays in my sons mouth. When he was younger (4 months or so) he did get his finger stuck in the little hole - so beware. Once he had enough coordination to handle the pacifier it wasn't a problem.
I bought this pacifier for my nephew in Brazil. My brother in law is a joker and I thought this pacifier would bring lots of fun. It's a great quality material and come with instructions to sanitize before using it, which I think is very important.
These bottles are so much better then the Tommie Tippie everyone kept telling me to get. I feel the nipple on these are closer to nature and she seems to spill a lot less with these. Plus they come completely apart so you can clean them really well.
Most parents say not to go with the pacifier but i bought tons before i found one that worked for my son.  This was the only one he would take.  The seam where the Silicone meets the plastic seems to get a little dirtybut this can be cleaned easily.
My daughter has been using this for the past 2 years and is very attached to it.  It is durable, easily washable and great.  Especially good when she was a preemie and couldn't yet keep the pacifier in herself we could prop the animal to hold it in.
All I have to say is wow for both the product and the seller my baby girl loves these and while there was a tiny misunderstanding which wasn't even that big of a deal this seller went above and beyond to make sure I was satisfied.<br /><br />Thanks,
they are funny looking teeth that i can add to baby gifts for the next 5 babies born (5 pair). Only issue is they are not indifidually wrapped and probably should be since they are to put in a little baby mouth.  These days clean is pretty at issue.
got this for 11 month old grandson who's teething. he was constantly drooling & in no time, drooling has stopped. it's unbelievable how well it has worked! grandson touched it when i put it on and hasn't touched it since. absolutely love it! thanks.
My son is 11 months old and still uses this pacifier exclusively (even though it's a newborn size).  It was great when he was younger because it was easy for him to hold onto.  I've been giving it as gifts to other pregnant moms.  Makes a cute gift!
this bed is amazing! my daughter is 20 months old and we do a lot of traveling. it fits perfect in hotel rooms. it is a little bulky, but worth carrying around. she loves it so much she pulls it out at nap time at home! very happy with our purchase!
This was the only pacifier my son would take for the first few months of his life, and now he loves the stuffed part and keeps it as a &#34;lovie or chewie&#34; at night. Although he doesn't normally take pacifiers, so having one he liked was great.
I love this rack...I wish it were bigger since I wash what seems like a hundred bottles a day.  I don't have a dishwasher..ugh!!  I have a large towel on the counter and I usually use this rack for the nipples. and the compartment for the pacifiers.
These are the only pacifiers our newborn would take. We bought several and used them until around 2 months and then switched to the next size up. We did not get the style pictured which was disappointing but it was listed that way so not a big deal.
i love it it comes as shown in picture it is easy to assemble as i did it myself i took it out and it didn't fall apart on me the packaging was good ups in the stroller box no rips in box and it came early than was given will order from seller again
My newborn absolutely loves his Wubbanubs! We received the monkey as a shower gift, but needed an extra one since he uses it so often. He loves to hold onto the animal, which helps keep the paci in his mouth. I highly, highly recommend this product!
I love knowing my son is getting the best when it comes to natural pacifiers. We've had these for a few months now and they've held up perfectly. They do turn darker once they're washed in hot water. But, this doesn't have any wear and tear on them.
love these baby blankets - simple design - so soft - breathable - great for summer months - much larger than normal receiving blankets.  i always buy these for gifts for friends/family who are having babies.  one of the best baby blankets out there.
easy to use, i can put this on by myself and put baby in the carrier at home or the park for walks.  i used this from when my daughter was 1 week old.  she is now almost 3 months and it is my go to baby carrier.  she loves it and falls asleep in it.
really love this carrier. it is easy to use, it feels safe, and my baby girl love it! i had a chicco and was really disappointed with it, so i looked for an alternative and now i am really happy with the nordic baby carrier. i strongly reccomend it.
got this for my grandson for christmas & while inexpensive it proved to be his favorite gift.  in fact; he & his little brother fought over it on several occasions.  well worth the price & i think i shall have to order another one to prevent ww iii!
i bought the britax roundabout for my 1 year old grandson. his father and mother were very impressed with the fit and safety rating. so impressed they ordered one, for one of their automobiles. grandson rides comfortable and happy.<br />thanks britax
i was worried about getting this vs. the more expensive cushee, but am glad i didn't fork out the extra money. this seat is very durable, doesn't tip over (no matter how weirdly my son climbs in), cleans easily and looks good too. highly recommended.
i am so happy with britax pavilion 70-g3 convertibe car seat. my 9 months old son really like it. his head is supported, straps are easy to close and overall when my baby is in this car seat it looks like he is really comfy and safe at the same time.
I love this.  2 pacis can fit in this pod.  I love that it matches my JJ Cole Diaper & Wipes Pod, and my diaper bag.  The material it is made out of is so easy to clean, and doesn't hold or absorb germs.  I love it.  It is a perfect baby shower gift.
My daughter absolutely loves these pacifiers.  We were hard set on switching her to pacifiers vs. her thumb, and these were a huge hit.  I received the product as pictured, and they are super cute. I would definitely buy them again or recommend them!
i bought this for my friend who just had a baby and she loves it!!  it's made of steel instead of plastic so it doesn't smell. it's taller so it's more ergonomic and it came in the perfect color to match the decor of her nursery.  highly recommend!!!
this is a great way to get that dose of vitamin d in the kids! it doesn't have a noticeable flavor so i just put it in their juice or milk in the morning! i love that the bottle and dropper are glass and there are no dyes or additives in the product!
Mi son loved this paci. Really he felt in love the minute he saw it  Pros:  He could hold hug it and find it easy  Cons:   The cleaning.  I could only wash them by hand (you cannot put the item on the washing machine)  I really recommend this product
I was able to modify this tabby wubbanub onto a first years Gumdrop pacifier. I made it so I can exchange pacifiers once a month, and then while I am exchanging pacifiers, I can also throw it in the laundry!!! I am going to try to put a pic up on top
the little attached pouch is great. it was easy to fold-up and carry the bag through the airport until it was time to cover the stroller before boarding our flight. it definitely kept our umbrella stroller in good condition traveling internationally.
Recommended to me by new grandmother who said WubbaNub was one of the best things her grandaughter received.  My expectant niece has an &#34;elephant&#34; theme so when I saw the WubbaNub Elephant, just had to get it.  Cute and everything I expected.
I love these things.  I have a few in different shapes for my little girl so there is always one in the car or crib.  The best thing about them is they allow you to prop it in their mouth to lower the chances of it falling out when they are sleeping.
i purchased this for my britax car seat & it fits great. it is very easy to put on & take off. and it keeps my son very warm in this cold weather. it's so much easier than having to carry a blanket around with you.  i'm very happy with this purchase!
This is the only pacifier my baby would use. He liked the Soothie one from the hospital (big circle one), but these were even better because they had the butterfly shape and a little hole in the handle to attach a clip. The colors are also very nice.
extremely happy with this product. was a little worried at first.<br /><br />it suctions really well - we move it twice a day and it never falls.<br /><br />what's nice about this device is that you can move it (unstick and stick) with just one hand.
What I like most about these is that they come with the covers that pop on and off easily so that the nipple itself stays protected.  They are nice and not at all flimsy like some of the other ones I have seen.  They do not irritate her mouth either.
I like this brand of pacifier wipes a lot better than the Arm & Hammer ones. These are more moist and have a nice apple scent/taste to them. This large container is a convenient size too - easy plastic dispensing lid that you pop up with just a touch.
These are the same as other nuk pacifiers except they have hello kitty on them! My granddaughter loves them.  I have sterilized them hand washed them several times already and the image is still perfect.  I was afraid it would rub off, but no worries.
arrive on time, its like the picture , I have a baby boy so I am happy to receive the blue one, in general breastfeeding babies do not like pacifier I tried many but this one stay in my baby mouth a little bit so I think with the time he will like it.
When we would put my son down for naps he would always loose his pacifier.  With the Wubbanub, it rests on his chest and he doesn't loose it.  Now that he is 5 months old, if he looses it, he finds it again and puts it back in his own mouth.  LOVE IT!
i love the pouches!!!  several reasons 1.  they have a lid not an annoying zip close. 2.  they lay flat to freeze or refrigerate. 3.  they can be used for milk or food. 4.  nothing to wash or sanitize<br />i would also recommend the bottle/food warmer
i was a little surprised when i received this in the mail of how small it really is.  they look so big when the babies are holding them.  it is absolutely adorable though!  soft and nice and light so the babies won't have a problem hanging on to them.
We own 3 Wubbanub, The lion, the monkey and the giraffe. The lion is the smallest of the 3 but works the best in the car seat. Our daughter is 5months old and can easily find him and put him in her mouth. Also makes it esy for us to find when driving.
tiny little purse-looking boxes. i loved them! i put an e.o.s. chapstick into each bag, with some little pacifier shaped candies, and closed it up. it all fit great into the bag. the cutest thing on our table--- besides are delicious baby shower cake!
I love this, even though my baby quit using pacifiers, he still hugs his Wubbanub to sleep. I can easily hand wash/hang dry the kitten. it has proven to be very durable. the pacifier is well stitched to the stuffy. I am very pleased with this product.
MY FAVORITE PACIFIERS!!<br />They say on the box all of the benefits, but the natural rubber, easy to clean, easy to sleep for the baby... and no face marks!<br />Extra safe and better for baby than all those plastic ones... love natursutten products!
My  granddaughter has never really liked a pacifier which is both good and bad. The only one she would use at all is this one. It's very durable and made it through the washing machine several times showing no signs of wear. Well worth the investment.
here's something i should have bought the day my son was born.  these are great and protect your seat backs from scuffs, mud, salt, snow etc.  there are even a few pouches on the top for him to store stuff in.  fit great on a toyota fj and benz glk350.
these are great. made in the usa. bpa free, and short enough that kids can use them easily. they are easy to clean and the forks are not sharp enough to poke hols in other things in a bag (or the kids mouth). great product. hope this review is helpful.
This pacifier has been great to use with my Grandaughter since her mom is breastfeeding. She had trouble breastfeeding after using other pacifiers. This one is our favorite especially since we are a cat family. She likes to hold onto one ear. So sweet!
i love this product! it works great! my three year old son used to cry every time i washed his hair during bath time because he hates water going in his face/eyes. this has been such a lifesaver! no more tears during bath time! he loves it and so do i!
i already owned one of these, and needed another. we use 2 in our house at the same time. they do not interfere with each other. we put 1 on channel a and the second one on channel b. we also have a big house and the monitors work throughout the house.
My child loved these and they didn't interfere with breastfeeding at all due to the natural shape.  If you are going to do a binky, this is a great first pacifier.  We had such success with them, that I've bought many for other baby showers since then.
Best baby invention ever! We have 2 wubbanubs (actually like the frog better, it lays on the baby better for ease of use when a newborn). We never lose a paci! Easy to clean, just throw it in the washing machine. Our baby loves holding onto the animal!
I know so many of my friends and family like Dr. Brown's anything, so since I was ordering some things for my great-granddaughter, and a friends soon to be born grandson, I bought this to put in my box of goodies for when I am invited to a shower, etc.
This was on their registry...I was a little concerned about it being removed from the registry after I purchased it because I'd had issues with that in the past (Not through Amazon!), but it was promptly removed. Can't wait to give it to the mom-to be!
i have used these before with my first son. now time for the second. i guess my boys pee a lot! so these help so i don't have to change sheets every night! i can't get them here on maui so i order them but another awesome product nanny/mommy swears by!
Got these pacifiers for my little one. My baby is very picky with the pacifiers and will only use these. One she has a hold of one of these she will keep it till she falls asleep. These have been a lifesaver for all. Items came quick and well packaged.
My baby is 9 months old and has had these since birth. They hold up well. They are easy to clean. Easy to find because the animals are more viable than a bouncy little binky. Very cute!! But the dog got this one the day it made it to us. So we are sad.
these little things are hard to come by. the overpriced baby store in town didn't have them. the wal-place didn't have them. amazon to the rescue! they got here in two days, and the pump is now happily helping to provide milk to my offspring once more.
These pacifiers are awesome.  I love that they glow in the dark so I can see them in the middle of the night if baby wakes up after spitting it out.  I just wish I could've found them in the smaller size when I first introduced the pacifier to my baby.
i purchased this item for my little guy just yesterday and love it.  it is so super easy to use.  other portable, table top highchairs are not so easy to use in my experience.  plus, it is very sturdy and made well.  i am very happy with this purchase!
without a doubt, if you're going on a plane, get this. so much easier to stuff the stroller in, throw it over your shoulder, and go... while maintaining the warranty while underneath the plane. i can only imagine the kind of torture it's put through...
My first two sons both liked soothie and gumdrop brand pacifiers. My youngest son, who is now 4 weeks, chokes and gags on those brands because they are too big for his mouth. He loves these pacis. They are much smaller and easier for him to latch onto.
My baby like it, is shock and bite resistant =).. not so much to say about a Pacifier. It's cool to buy a pair of translucent Pacifiers because the baby cannot recognize de difference of color if you misplace or lose one of them (some babies are picky)
I initially order one for my son, since he love it, I ended up ordering several more as gifts for friends and family.<br />it s easy to wash, and keep clean jut brought it in the wasting aching and that is it.<br />I highly recommend this toy-pacifier.
Works like a charm. My daughter loved it up until my wife and I got her to stop using which was a slight challenge. At 18 months, they should definitely be trained to get off pacifiers. I did try other products but none could compare to AVENT pacifiers.
this is a nice sheet because it has enough &#34;give&#34; to the fabric to stretch over mattress corners and make it easy to make up the crib, but not so much stretch that it gets baggy or wrinkled--it has a good smooth fit. it's a nice soft cotton too.
we use it a blanket for our baby at home, or tummy time mat or as a carseat canopy when we are out and as a stroller blanket.  we live in san francisco, it is fall weather all year round, so it is perfect for our weather, not too thick and not too thin.
My baby loves these.  These pacifiers' nipple is a little bit bigger which made it easier for my baby to keep them in her mouth.  She only uses them at sleep time or as a soother when she's particularly upset and they've helped settle her down. Big fan.
My son loves this thing! He loves to play with the animal and puts it back in his own mouth. He used to like this a lot more but He prefers his Avnet pacifier to this now. He still likes it now and then. Have two and will buy one for all my future kids.
Love these wipes & love that there's more than 36 in a pack. My in laws keep the baby while I'm at work & they tend to use several in a day. Haven't run out yet & it's been at least a month since they arrived & we've hardly used any at all, so it seems.
i purchased a second one of these guys because the little guy loved his first one to \\death\\.  wonderful.  his parents didn't think much of it when they first heard it, kind of freaked them out a little, but it quickly became one of his favorite toys!
I was worried because the pacifiers like this that you purchase in the store are not the same as the ones you get in the hospital.  I was very pleased with this product and besides changing colors from green to purple my infant had no problem switching.
makes life much easier.  we use it to mix up enfamil ar and now only have to once a day instead of 2-3 times a day.  when i added all the powder at once for 32 oz it did clump a little.  found that if i add powder in smaller amounts there are no clumps.
The baby loves these! We weren't too sure about the glow-in-the-dark gimmick, but it's been really helpful at night. When the baby drops it and starts to fuss, their easy to find in a dark room without having to turn on the lights and wake all of us up.
We searched for pacifiers that she would take for a while. We heard about these and tried them. It was worth it! She loves them. The only problem is that she is now mobile and has since lost all but one. I'm here ordering more. That's how good they are!
It goes wonderfully with my leaded crystal placenta serving bowl.  However, little Ainslee Quinoa prefers platinum to white gold.  I do hope in the future they will consider upgrading their material.  But I suppose for only 17K you get what you pay for.
this is a great dresser but it is being discontinued along with the other items in the set.  i had a hard time finding it avalible but was so glad to find it here on amazon because i saved $100 with free shipping when i purchased the crib along with it.
our daughter loves her swing. the canopy is a bit bothersome so we don't use it but otherwise the swing is comfortable and well made, plus it is made in the usa. grandma( my mother )with hand issues does have some trouble managing the release mechanism.
cheap price but really protect the nice leather seats in our honda pilot. pretty inexpensive for two. my kids can't seem to keep their feet off the seats no matter how many times you tell them. this was an easy solution to keeping the seats looking new.
my 3 month old still slept better swaddled, but he was a little houdini and came unwrapped from swaddle blankets. this stayed secure, resulting in longer nighttime sleep and eliminated my worry about loose blankets getting over the baby's mouth and nose.
all of our sons have had gerd and needed meds. these are great dispensers at a fair price. they have measurement marks on the sides. these come apart into 3 pieces for easy cleaning. these don't leak if screwed on correctly.<br /><br />very good product.
11 month old son loves this!  I bought this specifically for a long car ride (after seeing on Shark Tank!) and this kept him occupied, and happy, for a good portion of the ride! I've also gotten several compliments on this from the teachers at daycare :)
Got this one as a present for my sister in law but my son had them when he was tiny.  They are the perfect size to fit in their hands and hold in their mouth and adorable.  I only wish you could replace the pacifier - we had a dog who liked to chew them!
i love this dresser!!!! i love the color, style, everything about it. purchased it for my baby & it can definitely be used for years to come. not just \\baby\\ furniture. hubby said it was very easy to put together & he was surprised at the high quality.
My daughter has used Soothie pacifiers since she was about a week old. Now that she's in the chewing stage (about 6 mo), we got this one for daytime use. She loves it! It looks funny when she sucks on it because it's so big, but she doesn't seem to mind.
We received one of these pacifiers from the hospital and they are the only ones my baby will take! They are a little bigger than other pacifiers we bought to try but they are well made and hey, they make for a happy girl! Very satisfied with these pacis!
i got this lamp mainly to go with the bedding set, but when i got the lamp i was so glad because it is so adorable and it is defi. worth the money. i would recommend anyone that has a theme with ladybugs or anything that would go with this lamp to get it.
good to find a boy-color-themed set of pacifiers! the colors are bright without being garish, and the nipples are smooth and strong for your baby to suck on safely. keep in mind that you can probably get these for a better price at your local cvs, though.
i love this monitor. the only thing i would add is recording capability. the picture is clear, even in total darkness. the microphone is almost too good.. literally. it has lots of features, and we never have to deal with interference. highly recommended.
I bought this for my little one, she loves the 0-3 Soothie so I figured she would like these once she got a bit older. They are same size as the 0-3 green one, they are just a bit more stiff for the older mouth. I would definitely recommend this pacifier.
this was exactly what i was looking for. my 3yr old granddaughter has cerebral palsy and cannot walk yet but she does get around great by knee walking. this product not only cushions her knees but also helps to protect against calluses. best product ever!
Our daughter has used this style since she was born and really likes it. This 6 pack is perfect now that she's gotten a little older. We plan on weening her off when she gets around 1 like we did with our first. Until then, these are our number one choice
the tommee tippee bottles seem to be working really well for my baby. since it is really close to when i feed him, there isn't a huge shock factor for him. the shape of the bottle also helps with holding on, in the day or night. looks good and works well!
my 5 year old son can put his seatbelt on easily, and i feel safe knowing he's in the 5 point harness.  the quality of diono really beats out other car seats and is worth the price.  the buckles really prove to be more secure than other leading car seats.
i am incredibly content with this bag. it is very spacious and perfect for an over packer like myself.  it definitely has some weight to it empty and even more being over packed but i don't mind it at all.  not like i carry it all the time.  it's perfect!
These are the only ones my daughters will use. I've boughten Atleast 10 packages because we are always losing tHem. They are amazing especially with the clips. I always have a couple spares in te diaper bag, true bed, and my beside table. Highly recommend
love this thing. for times i don't want to lug around a diaper bag this is a lifesaver. i fit a regular sized pampers wipes in there, and then have enough room for about 3-4 size 3 diapers. i also keep a few disposable changing pads in the clutch as well.
we got this as a present for our niece who was turning one.  she loved it and the other kids at her party (ranging from 1-3) loved it as well!  it was by far the most popular toy.  packaging was great and the quality seemed like it would last a long time.
Love these! Before our daughter was done with her pacifier, these were a necessity for when we were out and her binky would drop on the floor. I also use them for toys and other items that inevitably end up on the floor, too. A must for parents of babies!
we've been using this for about a week.  so far it's been wonderful.  i love it.  the screen is clear, you can zoom in or out.  you can pan up, down, left, right.  it's perfect.  i heard people complain about interference, but we haven't had any thus far.
this is my second klean kanteen from healthegoods.  i had an issue with the first on the sport top breaking off and they replaced it no problem.  i bought this smaller one for my son and he loves it!  i recommended them to my mom friends at work!  thanks.
i debated if my 4.5 year old would fit, he does just fine.  he love riding with his baby sister.  i also take my baby on her own when my son wants to walk and it handles fine.  i am tall, 5'11&#34; and have no troubles running with it.  love the handling.
Love them. Great quality. Shape is big enough for a 6 months baby. (Tried NUK, left marks on baby's face)<br />Nice msg, makes me happy by looking at them.<br />Handy to have the case to sterilize the dummy at anywhere with a microwave. Great purchasing !
These are great! These Munchkin pacifiers are truly lightweight and my niece loves them. She can keep ahold of them because they are so lightweight and shaped just right. They are well-made and seem to hold up well under regular use. Very happy with these!
gently used. perfect condition. all accessories present and in perfect condition. can start as rear facing infant seat and convert to front facing toddler seat. instruction booklet included. installation realitively easy. secures child well.great purchase.
this is the best! i had the boppy pillow but gave it away and bought this after trying it at my dr.s office- in comparison it is thicker and much larger to really support the baby while nursing. i would absolutely suggest this pillow to any first time mom!
Started off with the Lamb and then because it was such an important part of grandson's accommodation to play and security,ordered other animals.  East for the baby and parents, can catch easily and lays on baby's chest.  Love to see him cuddle the animals.
These work well for my son. I don't think the shape is orthodontically approved, but really... would any pacifier be when you think about it? We like it. And i'm sure we will be reading every internet blog about how to get rid of these things any day now!!
If your kid likes MAMs these are great, easy to hold in there mouth by themselves and they look cute too! The glow feature is awesome and they really do glow pretty bright in a dark room. Very helpful if baby drops binky and your searching with tired eyes.
I loves these but my daughter hated them she preferred her favorite paci...they r nice and very flexible don't have any hard plastic ,so if u have a wild sleeper they won't b hurt but these if they roll over it or hit it wit their face if it falls out!! :)
These pacifiers are the ONLY pacifiers my daughter likes. But she like to have it upside down (the sucking part is still the same) but on the top where it touches her lip has a tiny inscription and she decided to just put it upside down and she loves them.
Love these wipes for their quality and mildness ! My baby often drops her pacifier and other teething toys and these come to my rescue ALL the time ! My baby's occupational therapist was astonished to hear about wipes for pacifiers available these days :))
Gumdrop pacifiers were the ones my daughter was sent home with from the hospital and the only ones she would take from then on lol they work great and without them I dont think she would have ever soothed herself back to sleep on those restless nights lol.
This is our first child, and he loved the pacifier like this from the hospital, so that's all we've tried as he takes it immediately. He hasn't shown any signs of nipple confusion with a paci...once he's fed, he'll take this willingly and is great with it.
These are the only ones I will buy for my 3yo now.  He still uses a pacifier at night.  These are bigger, for his big kid mouth and they stand up to the chewing.  The clear silicon ones rip within a week or so and these latex ones last for a couple months.
Love our lil tiger WubbaNub! These lil cuties are easy for baby to handle, are machine washable, and not easily lost. Big thanks to the Kaiser NICU nurse that gave us our first one. We totally love them - so much so that we now have 5 of them, actually. :D
Our Brian loves this pacifier! He holds on to it for dear life, and just loves the little monkey. This is one clever design, and it's the second one we've purchased in this series. I guarantee we'll be back for more, because the baby just loves it so much.
Love these!<br />Bought these for my 13 year old years ago. Decided to use the exact pacifier for the new baby. Since my oldest loved them so much. Not to mention they are SUPER cute. Shipping was FAST. Order on February 22nd got it on the 25th. Thank you.
My little one doesn't take Soothie pacifiers but I actually tore it out and sewed it my adapter for MAMS pacifier, and she loves it! It's the perfect size not to big not to small. Also gave me a shipping day of feb 9th and got here on the 6th ! Super nice!
Quality: yes. Good for both mom & dad: yes. Holds enough for newborn & infant? Yes. Adjustable strap is great, number of pockets are great. Please note things put in pocket and decrease the amount of rom on the inside (just as most things with pockets do).
i have a kindergarten teacher.  these have been a wonderful investment and time saver.  i use them in stations for sight word, letter, and number games.  i have not had any problems with the papers falling out when the students roll them.  they are great!!
this outfit is totally adorable, it's soft and fits wonderfully! my 7 month old didn't have any issues with it at all, it probably felt like one of those snuggie blankets. plus she got a ton of compliments on how cute she looked, it's well worth the price.
I bought these for a friend whose baby was in the NICU. These are the pacifiers we give the babies in our NICU where I work. The babies love them! I don't know if it's the light sweet smell they have or there fun shape, but those babies quiet right down :)
we love this clock!  we had issues with my son waking us up at 6 am even on saturday's until we got this clock.  he now stays in his room till his little friend turns green!  i would recommend it to anyone that has a child that is an early riser like ours.
Love avents pacis. Cute farm characters on paci. Son loves them. There isn't a huge difference in the 0-6 and 6-18 month size so not a huge transition. My son wouldn't take anything but wubba nub soothies before this. So glad found something that he LOVES.
My son would't take any pacifier before giving him this one. An added plus, u can insert ur finger to harden it if he needs extra soothing for teething. Very hygenic too as water won't come in to his mouth from any hidden place after sterilizing. I love it
this doesn't have much structure but works as an extended sun shade for our old model stroller that has a small sunshade.  yes, you need a sun shade to attached this too so say if you lost your shade for an infant carrier, this will not work to replace it.
Our baby girl went straight from the Hawaii Medical Gum Drop pacifiers to these and had no issue. She does great with these and keeps them in her mouth much better than she was with those as she got older. I bought another 2 after trying them out with her.
I haven't seen these in person yet, but my son and daughter-in-law both like them. She even confirmed that the actual pacifer is the same kind given to their twins in the hospital. They appear to make the pacifer both easier to stay put and easier to find.
if you have little ones, you know that these things get thrown, smashed, chewed on, etc. most of the ones i've used also leak, which is the worst thing. thus far, these come apart fro cleaning easily and have withstood the test of my two year old grandkids.
Absolute life saver, my daughter wouldn't be without it. Had to buy 4 of them in case as was the case one got lost.<br />Can't go to bed without it.<br />Would recommend to any parent.<br />Never loose your babies dummy and when its worn it can be replaced.
So happy to find they made gumdrop pacifiers for 6m+!  Our baby loved these as a newborn and still loves them now at 11m.  We love them because they are one, molded piece - so no worrying about the pacifier end popping off and they are really easy to clean.
My twins love these! They were very early so they took a bit to get good enough hand control to grab their pacifiers. With these they were able to hang on to the animals with their arms. These are in many of their pictures because they love love love them!!

This is a cute little gift that can be used as a gift or a accessory to  wrapping a gift.  Adorable.  The service was extremely fast, as well.  I received  these pacifiers much more quickly than I expected.  Thanks for the great service  and unique product.
i absolutely love it. i like how its the perfect length. my daughter was less irritable after having it on for a period of time and drooled way less. i would definitely recommend to other moms, especially to those who are curios about the amber necklaces (:
My child loves them, and now so does every baby at daycare... they are constantly trying to snatch the different looking paci.<br /><br />She always wants to put the wrong end or the sides in her mouth, and this was the only paci that was soft on all sides.
This pacifier had all the features I was looking for; solid one piece construction, European country of origin, and all natural materials. Not to mention my daughter loves it. Only con is it is silent when it hits the floor making it hard to find sometimes.
These bottles are pretty great, IMO. I admit, there are a lot of parts to take apart and clean, but you get used to it like everything else. Mine have only leaked when I don't screw them properly. I have a 5 week old, fussy girl and these are great for her.
We got this Stachifier after seeing my little one's cousin with one. We couldn't resist. Not only do we get a kick out of seeing him in it, but he loves seeing himself in the mirror with it. He just cracks up! I will be purchasing the other styles for sure!
my baby has had this wubb from when he was a week old, he's now almost 8 months. we love it. we always get complements about how cute it is. it is very convenient because its so big, its easier for our baby to find it on his own when he loses it in his crib
I had this saved as a bookmark as soon as I saw it waiting to find out if my niece was having a boy or a girl.  I bought it and used it as a bow on her present at the baby shower and everyone loved it.  The little man looked pretty adorable with it as well.
i pump everyday at work up to three times per day.  this tank is comfortable, supportive and functional.  it holds the pump flanges in place and also functions as a nursing bra when i get home.<br /><br />this is a great product that i would purchase again.
These are the same pacifiers my son was given in the hospital, and he would not take any other kind of pacifier. I only wish they were a little easier to put a pacifier clip on, because they bounce when dropped (or thrown across the room by an 8 month old).
fits perfectly the cameleon bugaboo stroller. very good quality. love the options to use either the fleece cover or the duvet cover. seems very comfortable and very warm. baby looks super happy! i can only wish something like that existed when i was a baby.
Best investment ever.  My son loves his monkey and it holds up great. Does great in the washer. I have 3 of them for him so we can interchange them.  Love that we never lose it and that it allows my son to manipulate it to sooth himself. Highly recommend!!!
After using this with our newborn to help reduce the number of times we'd have to pick up a dropped pacifier from his mouth while soothing him, we became instant fans.  It's now my go-to gift for moms-to-be.  It's saved our sanity a number of times already!
bought this as a x-mas gift for granddaughter.age 7.  seems to be made well, i really wish it plugged in so it could be used as a night light.  it's really cute.  she loves finding the constellations.  good item.  thanks amazon for great service, as always!
I am sure a lot of parents are looking for a way to make the pacifier stay in place. Well the little stuffed animal is laying on your babys chest and stays in place. I am very happy with it...less running back and forth to his room to give him his pacifier.
this cup is great for transitioning from bottle to standard sippy cup. our little one was able to hold onto this one easily and the flexible drinking top is similar enough to a bottle that the cup isn't such a foreign concept to him. overall a great product!
I love this pacifier! My baby was using the soothie pacifiers, including the wubbanub (with a plush doll at the end), but this stays much better in her mouth. It still falls out of her mouth when she falls asleep, but a lot less frequently than the soothies.
i bought this for my new grandson and his first time mother.  so far we have not had to use it, but i know that when the time comes that we do, it will be perfect for the task.  i would recommend this to my family and friends with children and grandchildren.
My baby is 3 months old and has had colic since about her 2nd week so we broke down and gave her a paci!  This is the only brand and style paci she takes and she loves it!  It calms her down and has never interfered with her ability to latch onto the breast!
medela products are great quality. easy to clean and the medium flow is perfect for a little older baby. i like that i never had to use another flow after the slow flow. they really hold up well and i will be saving them for the next baby. no cracks or tears
I think this was a brilliant idea! Babies not only like the pacifier, but the limbs of the animals help out during teething. I also think that by chewing and sucking on the limbs and not just the pacifier will help when it's time to say good bye to the paci.

this seems to be my 7 month old grandsons favorite toy, he loves to pop it in his mouth to help his teething gums, and laughs to the music it plays. if he starts squirming too much during a diaper change, i just hand him his baby einstein and he holds still!
my daughter has loved this swing since she was born (1 month old today).  we use it everyday!  i love that you can turn it in 3 different directions too.  the base is about 3 feet wide so you have to have an area large enough for it to fit.  would recommend.
more fun than anything.  if you're cutting one banana, is it worth it?  probably not.  if you're cutting several bananas?  absolutely.  just rinse it off immediately after using - before the fruit residue has a chance to dry - and it should last a long time.
My daughter never took to a pacifier, but she loved playing with the stuffed animal attached to it. She occasionally sucked on the pacifier when she was in the car, but mostly it was just a chew toy for her! Either way, she loved her WubbaNub! Easy to clean.
I ordered these pacifiers for my best friend's newborn son.  Although I wish I could have picked the color / pattern of the pacifiers, I am super happy with this product.  They are durable, well-sized, and adorable.  Not to mention, they pacify baby AND mom.
My now 12 month old likes these and I feel good about the natural rubber.  The natural rubber lasts approx. 6-9 months of baby sucking before getting sticky.  Not much difference between their &#34;6-12 month&#34; and the &#34;12 months and up&#34; products.
this plush blanket is incredibly soft, i love wrapping my baby in it at bedtime and cuddling him in it during the day. i love that it is gender-neutral (the giraffes are so cute), and i love the soft, cottony yellow edging of the blanket. highly recommended!
I recomand this prodect to anyone it is so cute i got it for my nephew and i wasnt sure he'd like it since he only likes the chupon the hospital gave him and rejects all other but i decided to get it anyway and he loved it XD (chupon means pacifer in spanish)
My son just doesn't like pacifiers, but he likes this one when he's tired enough and just needs something to gnaw on for a minute while he falls asleep.   I like that's it's one piece, and it's tough so I don't have to worry about him breaking it or anything.
i all around love this. haven't used it to warm up baby food just yet. but it's warmed up my breast milk perfectly, and water. i would recommend if you have hard water and develop calcium deposits to put vinegar in the bottom and let it sit. then wipe out. :)
although this item is bulky, my husband says that he can knock people down with it, lol, this item holds a carseat.  it makes the carseat easy to transport when traveling through an airport.  you will get strange looks but oh well at least your child is safe.
Our son had no interested in any pacifier we tried to give him. My wife had used AVENT pacifiers with some of her daycare kids, so we decided to give them a try with our son. They were perfect for him and now e have purchased more for our soon to be daughter.
These are the only pacifiers my little one would take! We had tried the soothies and she just couldn't hang on to them-they kept popping out! These are much easier for her to keep in. She can soothe herself to sleep in the middle of the night now! Happy mama.
These work absolutely wonderful.  My newborn daughter likes to launch hers and somehow get them to land under her bed.  They stay glowing for really long periods of time, which makes them much easier to locate at 2am when she loses hers.  They are the best!!!
amazing natural product !<br />i used it on my baby for 2 months and its fabulous !  he has smooth skin & rash is gone..<br />it also moisturises extremelty well ! my baby loves it !!<br />thank you &#34;la petite cr猫me&#34;<br />happy baby , happy mommy ! 馃槉
i love this! i bought it so we could do a nighttime formula feeding without any hassle. it's great! it's easy to assemble and disassemble and very easy to use. works great and my baby loved it. my husband was able to do a nighttime feeding and i got to sleep!
I purchased these from the Amazon baby registry. The Mom said they were better than described, especially the  quality and workmanship. We will purchase from this seller again. We are expecting twins, so it's double the cost, and the cost of these is perfect.
I bought this as a gift for my new nephew, but it's the perfect size and weight for infants.  It gives them something to grab onto and heavy enough to stay in place for those just learning, but easy enough for them to spit out and not choke.  Love the turtle!
have 2 under 2 and this allows me to keep an eye on both of them! So thankful for this monitor! Has great range too, we can grill on the patio in the back at night or during the weekend when the girls are napping, and can see them in crystal clear definition.
This works just as others described.  My five month old constantly spits out his pacifier but this gives him something to hold onto to help it stay in place.  Its also a lot easier to find when it gets laid down somewhere than a little pacifier all by itself.
I bought this pacifier as a Christmas present for my now 7-month old nephew.  He absolutely loves it.  He's able to grab the toy and put it back in his mouth.  His mom said it was the best Christmas gift he received.  They also ordered another one as back up.
Best pacifiers you can get for breastfeeding babies. We haven't had any issues with nipple confussion. We love thay thay come in sterilizing boxes. These are the only pacifiers my baby will take and it has not affected his willingness or desire to breastfeed.
Read previous reviews and was not sure about the product. Ordered and the stickers work great. Placed on clean flat painted wall with limited handling of stickers and used wall paper squeegee after placement. It is bright and cheerful perfect for the nursery.
My grandbabies love this pacifer, the toy that is attached to it is easy for them to hold and find.  It is easy to wash, I put it in the dishwasher when needed and it comes out good as new.  Better yet it is easy to find and easy to notice when it is dropped.
I bought this paci when my son was about 2-3 months old because I thought it was super cute. My son is now 8 months and has yet to use it, he stopped using his pacifier around 2 months old so I never got around it giving it to him. I still think it's so cute!
our toddler is all about cookie monster and elmo right now so when i saw this i had to get it for him.  he loves it!!  the towel looks great and is plenty big enough for our 18mo.  its not a super heavy weight fabric but its not cheap hotel towel thin either.
wonderful! we've had this for two years now and it has put our son to sleep since he was there months old! it has white noise and lullibies as well as 6 projector screens. its still running just as good as it did when we bought it and we have dropped it a lot!
Our son (8 months) really loves these pacifiers. He doesn't accept any other. Since we ordered the pacifiers from Germany, we especially appreciate that the seller did fill in the customs form correctly. Therefore, everything went smoothly with German customs.
glider arrived with the back broken. contacted stork craft and they quickly sent out a replacement. everything said and done glider put together it's nice and smooth.<br /><br />most important to me is customer service.. storkcraft did a fantastic job at that.
started using these for my 5 month old when she started solids.  the spoon width and the angled feeding is comfortable for me and less messy all around.  she also enjoys chewing on these when not eating as a teether.  i will purchase these again in the future.
These are the best ones, My LO had Mam and Avent spacifiers, she liked them for a while then she never wants them again, I bought Dr.Brown pacifiers, It took a day or more for my baby to get used with these and then she loves it, its very easy and good for her
my baby had gas/constipation because of a tongue tie issue. this was great to give him some gripe water. he took it at 3 weeks old without any issues, even though he is breastfed. it is easy to assemble and easy to clean. will be nice to have as he gets older.
I've tried many with this similar nipple shape, and this one has worked best for our baby.  It's great for small mouths, our daughter would gag on many.  This has a shorter stem.  Cleans fine.  It will get water inside but it squeezes out.  I have bought many.
I love this binky! I bought this binky because my daughter had a rash around her mouth from other pacifiers and saw this which did not touch her face at all....and within 2 days the rash was gone. Now my baby has her safety blanket and her beautiful face back.
Very good product, this is the only soother my baby wants to use. The best baby soother in market. I've tried 10's of different baby soothers and finally found this one. Do not have to try any others, get this great baby soother and enjoy quiet in your house:)
me, my wife and our son (2 yrs old) love these bottles. they are well made, easy to clean and contain no plastic. only downside is the price. we waited on the silicone sleeves but eventually got them also and have to say they are also great and an improvement.
my grandson is 6 mos old and this is the best investment i have made so far.  keeps him warm without big bulky clothing and it is fog/ moisture proof and wind can't get through it. the bottom opens for feet to stick out so i see at least a couple of years use.
My daughter has been a wubbanub lover from the day she was born, and just like all of the others she has had she loves the adorable owl just as much as the other one's.  I have recommended this product to all of my friends and family members who are expecting!
we absolutely love this high chair, and so does our son!  it's perfect for mealtime, and easy to get him in and out of it.  even after he is done eating, he enjoys sitting in his chair and playing with his toys on the tray!  i would recommend this to everyone!
supportive and it prevents my daughter鈥檚 neck from moving back and forth while she鈥檚 sleeping. i love the fact it鈥檚 completely smooth one side and soft and furry on the other. my daughter prefers the smooth side; overall we are very pleased with this purchase.
These are as close to the hospital ones as I could find. My baby loves them and I actually like these BETTER than the hospital one because the hole on the ring is big enough for me to put my finer thru so that I can hold it without getting germs on the nipple.
this fits perfectly over the mats at daycare. it rolls up nice and neat. the fleece blanket on the top is plenty warm. throw the whole thing into the washer and dryer and you are good to go! this is great product that i wish i would have found a long time ago!
My son will take most any type of pacifier if he is wanting it bad enough, but these MAM Air pacis are his absolute favorite. They even stay in his mouth when he's asleep which keeps me from having to wake up to put it back in since he's not really able to yet.
Hilarious! My nephew is not here yet but I am even more excited to see him now that I have this pacifier for him. As for size and fit of the pacifier...I cannot help. I have NO clue what I am doing in that area. But for the money it is worth a good laugh. Enjoy
better then the original and i like the original a lot.  great use of multifunction, multiuse stroller.<br />chic design and very reasonable price for the seat/shopping bag and other accessories.  this seller includes all you need, others will only sell u seat.
Being a first time grandma & kept thinking about how many receiving blankets I rolled up to keep my own baby's pacifier in place, what an awesome idea!  Baby granddaughter loves to hold soft furry meow and gets all her comfort at same time.  Buy at least three!
I bought this set as a &#34;We're Pregnant!&#34; gift to give to my parents that are big Cubs fans. We wrapped them up with a little note saying &#34;Please keep these for when I come to visit.&#34; They loved it and cannot wait to see their grandbaby use this!
Love these paci's! They really work...hold them in front of a light for a few seconds before putting them in the crib an they stay lit for most of the night. My daughter is able to find them in the middle of the night instead of crying for me to get it for her!
i purchased these trays after using hard ice cube trays made for baby food. these are great! i just run a little hot water over the bottom and pop them right out into the freezer bags. don't fill the tray all the way, though, or the lid won't go on quite right.
finally baby is comfortable! we always thought that our baby should be as comfortable as we are at night when we travel. i wish i had known about this mattress topper sooner! our 10 month old loves his play yard now and mum and dad are happy watching him sleep.
i love these bottles. the nipple is designed to be more like mothers breast vs other nipple that are straight. great for babies that are breast-fed. i also like that fact that you can transition it to a sippy cup with a handle and sippy nipple/top as they grow.
My baby loves this little dog.  She likes being able to hold onto something when soothing herself with the pacifier.  I have three WubbaNubs and this one is a little smaller and lighter then the others (dragon and monkey) which would make it good for a preemie.
we bought this mobile for my baby that is 2 months old and he loves it. the movement of the toys is not round so he has to do an effort to follow his favorite toy (the seahorse). he could spend a lot of time just seeing the movement of the toys, i recommend it.
What more can I say. This was a super cute pacifier that didn't look like one. My daughter used this for so long! The shape was perfect for her and the elephant gave her something to hold on to and snuggle. Highly recommend despite the cost. It's well worth it.
Our twin girls love their Wubbanubs, and are a must have for nap time.  They really help keep the pacifier in their mouth so that I'm not running in and out of the room putting it back in.  I love all the cute animal options.  Would be a great baby shower gift!
this is the best baby monitor we've had so far! we can finally get signal all around the home without any black spots. this is perfect for us. i love how light the monitor is compared to our older generation black/white baby monitor that's big, bulky and heavy.
My little one can push this back into her mouth without exhausted mother getting up to help. That in itself makes this item one of my most valuable possessions. She also likes to snuggle her &#34;gator&#34; while falling asleep after she's spit the pacifier out.
when my babies had their portraits taken one of them really wanted his pacifier. because it's clear it looked beautiful in the photo. he loves his pacifier so it made sense in the photo and didnt detract from the look at all. it actually made him look very sweet
The only pacis to buy! Love how they fit against the face. This is an advantage to when your baby starts sleeping on their stomach and turning their head from side to side. It does not get easily knocked out like other pacifiers do. Not as bulky as other brands.
sturdy chair attaches to any table, we even took it to the beach with us! seat cover wipes clean very easily, only criticism i would have is there were no color choices...would have preferred something other than red but this is an awesome product for the money!
i prefer this mesh feeder to the munchkin brand.  this one is larger and easier to clean.  i don't really like to put food in it.  i freeze unsweetened applesauce in a ice cube tray, then pop one into the mesh.  my son loves them, especially when he is teething.
I wanted something cute, (and not girly,) for my son. Even though he isn't a huge paci fan, this gives him something to hold and play with. The bull looks exactly as pictured, and washes well. It is very lightweight and small, making it perfect for baby's hands.
What is there to say? If you have a binky baby these do the trick for keeping them quiet and content! Love the product but hoping to break mine from the unnessasary sucking that she loves to do ALL day and night! Time for my babe to learn other coping skills. :)
i love this wrap!  my son get hot very easily, so i chose this wrap to be able to use on a daily basis - so far, whenever we use it, he's very happy in it and doesn't overheat!  the only thing is, this isn't the same size as a moby wrap, it's a little shorter...
So glad to have cute girly ones for my new baby girl, & these are a little better priced than in the store, which is nice cause I seem to be misplacing them often. Its nice that I can grab more just a click away. Amamzon-Prime is a stay at home moms best friend!
this system is a real time saver!!! you really need the bags, bottles, bottle warmer and nipples. the storage tray i didnt find very necessary, but it is still more economical to buy the set to start you out. it is a great way to pump and feed for a working mom.
this is really great.  i had a few of the character ones and my child always complained his butt hurt.  once i bought this one i have had no more trouble.  so glad i went ahead and bought it.  i also do not have any trouble with it fitting sturdily on my toilet.
He had this since 2nd months , help with collics.<br />He now take this for nap time, help soothing and help him fall asleep in no time.<br />This can interfere with breastfeeding though...<br /><br />My son won't take any other size or othe type of pacifier lol
great booster seat for my 5 year old.  i bought this seat over a year ago and it's still good as new.  my son is now 5 and still fits safe and comfortably in his booster. i'm very pleased with the purchase.  it's not too bulky and it was pretty easy to assemble.
this is my favorite bag of all times.<br />the quality of this diaper bag is amazing!<br />i love everything about it.<br />the numerous pockets, the sleek look of the shiny leather,the different size straps.<br />i strongly recommend it.<br />i love this purse.
Works great for our picky newborn who hates a &#34;classic&#34; type of pacifier! She even likes to hold onto this pacifier when it's in her mouth. I like the fact that this pacifier is made from one solid piece of material and is easy to clean. Would recommend!
i ordered this for my 1.5yr old son who would not sleep in the pack n play after numerous attempts. the first night we were away from home and i put the mattress in, he slept through the night. this was a life saver while we were away! i would highly recomend it!
My almost 6 month old loves these.  It's not much larger than the one he used after the smoothie ones from the hospital but we like that it doesn't mash into his big cheeks and the clear allows us to see more of his sweet face (since he's got it in all the time)!
this is a great concept, but as others have stated beware of bananas.  my son loved bananas, so i just bought a bunch of the extra nets because they do get ruined after putting bananas in there.  my baby especially liked when i put frozen fruits in there for him!
We have had several of the wubbanub pacifiers over the last few years, and I believe this one (pink bear) is the softest. The wubbanub are great and very well loved. Even when outgrown as a pacifier, it has remained a very important stuffed animal during bedtime.
bought this so i could use an already-owned backpack as a diaper bag. organizes diapers and wipes for two kids, plus all the little things so they don't just get lost in the bottom, and there's room left on top of the backpack to stash blankets and such. perfect.
i was afraid of getting this because of comments about chemical smells. there was no chemical spell. it had a slight new plastic smell but nothing crazy. it makes the pnp a lot more comfortable and she now sleeps in it all night. :) so this was kind a life saver.
we have a motorhome with cabinets that could open while traveling over some of the rough highways in america. this product will be a great solution to secure the cabinet doors, easy to install and remove, and look great.<br />thanks for the solution to my problem
I have retired all of our non-Wubbanub pacifiers since my son prefers these so much! They can get a little grungy from being chewed and drooled on, but I just send them through the washing machine. They are very good quality and look brand new when they come out.
They work great for my younger one, and the fact they glow in the dark is awesome because I don't need to search for it anymore when they fall out his mouth. I haven't noticed in the last month that the glow itself bothers him or distracts him so thats great too.
Our newborn baby girl (5 days old) absolutely LOVES her little elephant pacifier holder. Her little fingers / hands can get around the elephant and she has something to &#34;hold&#34; onto as best as possible. I'd highly recommend - great item and fast shipment!!
This thing is amazing I mean since I'm an ab type person ahaha<br />Well the mouth piece the shape is amazing and the feel so I could suck on it all day and the skull and crossbones on the front is so adorable. I love this thing<br /><br />I would so recommend it
this item has changed our bath time routine forever!!! the past three years have been nothing but fussing and tears for my sensitive daughter's hair washing. we used the product with smiles and laughter; she loved wearing it and did not complain at all! buy this!
i use this stroller for my 2 year old, and she has plenty of room to sit comfortable or to lie back and nap. theres a small puffy pillow by her head built into the seat. the basket underneath is big, and the handles are taller so theres no hunching while pushing.
Cute. My son loves it. I didn't get it for him until he was 9 months old but he still enjoys it. It keeps the pacifier from bouncing all over the place. We have many Soothie pacifiers and can never find them when they have fallen because they bounce under things.
best sippy cups we have used yet.  they do not leak, unless shaken upside down like a salt shaker.  they have a rubbery nozzle that toddlers/infants tend to like.  it holds a lot but is manageable enough to control for a little one.  i would definitely buy again.
Loved this for my daughter and nephew. It helps the pacifier stay in their mouth while still giving them the freedom to spit it out if they really want. My nephew loved hanging on to the Giraffe when going to sleep. As long as we had this, bedtime was easy peasy.
My baby only likes this pacifier.<br />I love the quality and color of this product. The only downside is that sometimes water or baby's saliva gets in them and there is no way to clean this since you cannot take it apart.<br />It was shipped and arrived in time.
This worked great! I have the ear and forehead thermometers and both are pretty inaccurate. This one worked great first try! The only thing is the nipple is a bit longer and skinnier than the nuk brand my kids are used to, but my daughter didn't even make a face.
this is the cleanest, simplest and most efficient training potty out there.  it doesn't have silly bells and whistles, but rather gets the job done well and fits my son comfortably.  it's super easy to empty/clean and doesn't distract from my clean decor at home.
These are by far my favorite pacifiers.  We just had our third child and I picked some up, yet again.  I like to give them a quick &#34;charge&#34; with the flashlight app on my phone and I can easily find it in the dark, so as not to wake up a fussy sleepy baby.
No little chocking parts, my daughter loves his. She can sleep with this on top of her and when she spits it out the pacifier stays where it is. Very easy for her to grab as well and cleans easily in a mesh bag. Now own multiple of these and very happy with them.
i am not a fan of their swaddle pods but i love these! we could not have survived the first three months without them. they are a great deal and for the amount of washing we did to them they held up great. we were swaddle challenged and these make it really easy.
this sleep sack is great! keeps my baby warm without having to use a blanket that could get all twisted up. my daughter ended up with her feet inside the sack 1/2 the time, defeating the purpose of the leg holes, but i guess that's how she liked it! great product!
when i saw the theme precious planet flannel blankets i just had to order them.  i didn't expect them to be very high quality because of the price.  but to my surprise they were very well made and can't wait to use them in january 2013 when the grand baby arrives.
My wife bought this for our new baby about 2 months ago. She has used it every day since. She loves the soothie brand pacifier and she loves this one a lot. Baby likes to grab the plush body while sucking on the pacifier. Great product, would definitely recommend.
solid and well made.  the assembly process takes a little while, but that's actually a good thing because the parts are really well attached to each other with fasteners in multiple places.  having 4 heights at which the mattress can be positioned is very helpful.
very nice canopy and fits my chicco keyfit 30 infant car seat well. love that the baby can see through the net, and you can check on the baby, while being protected from sunlight, wind and bugs. exactly what i was looking for... plus its very pretty in pink color!
my daughter has refused all types and sizes of pacifiers... except this one. it saved me when my husband was out of town for a week. she doesn't take it frequently but occasionally is good enough. i think its because she is breastfed and it is most similar to her.
My baby sleeps with those, and sometimes it becomes a habit that he will not go to sleep without those. You don't want your babies to rely on those too much, but at the same time this will save you all the hassle or comforting them and trying to put them to sleep.
These are a must-have at restaurants when my daughter drops all her toys on the floor!  Since these wipes are food-grade [safe], I use them to clean the nipples of bottles while on the go.  These, combined with the ready-to-eat similac make for a much easier trip!
Received in under 3 days. Well packaged, and ready for gift-giving. Neice loved it! Perfect size for a baby to wrap their little arms around. Colors are pretty and patterns lively. Don't think I could pull the little animal from the pacifier if I tried. Well made.
With our first baby, he was always losing his binky and we were always buying more and finding them later on. This product allows us to always keep track of it and she LOVES pulling the elephant head up to her mouth to keep the binky in place. Absolutely adorable!
chair works great, child must be buckled in chair, light weight and easy to travel with, would like to be able to ajust distance from table to baby may help child sit up and not slid down in seat. the dining tray is a good option to have, works great on our table.
When we first tried this non-contact thermometer we double checked it's accuracy with a contact thermometer. After a few times we found that this thermometer was very accurate and needed no further verification. Temperatures can be taken when the baby is sleeping.
Purchased this for the humor of it, money well spent. Everyone finds it amusing. It's a good pacifier but not great, although I can't say why. I just know that it's not our go to pacifier for our son. Purchased it around Halloween as part of an outfit for our son.
Awesome gift for the Cardinal fan parent(s). Bought this for a male co-worker whose wife is expecting this summer. Unfortunately they are recommended for 3 months and up, so hopefully the baby could sport the pacifier during another WORLD SERIES? Here's to hoping!
so cute.  arrived on time.  very well made.  long enough for my child.  she is 4 but 45&#34; tall and i wanted something that she could stretch out on. she uses it for her prek class.  easy to carry with strap.  had it monogrammed.  she really likes it and so do i.
This is a must! We've raised many children and trying to take temperatures on infants can be a chore. This thing is very accurate, construction is great and it comes with a cover for the nipple. So far, it's been very quick and reliable. Plus, the price is pennies!
what's not to love about turning your little girl (or boy) into a lobster fresh out of the tub?  it's hilarious, and my 6 month old little girl seems to find it comfortable enough to enjoy (we purchased it back when she was 5 months old and it worked just as well).
LOVE these.....so does my son, and my nephew :)<br />DO NOT be fooled by the first years brans gumdrop....they are NOT the same...the inner plastic is harder, they are a glossy silicone not a softer silicone. My son loves the hawaii medical but not the first years.
first i want to comment on the 1st person's review.  this pillow IS NOT for a one month old... it's for 24 months and up.  did not do her research!<br /><br />this pillow is awesome.  now my son's head doesn't slouch down to his chest while napping.  and very soft!
my baby loved this, it's got an elliptical shape so it's easier to fit into mouth. my baby was picky and wouldn't take some of the rounded pacifiers like soothie despite the overwhelming number of positive reviews. this one turned out to be perfect and a lifesaver!
we did our homework on the best child safety products before we bought these magnets and found all kinds of positive reviews from other parents. these magnets were easy to install without having to drill into our cabinetry and work really well. we are very pleased!
Cute pacifiers. They contour (unlike some other brands) making it easy to keep in their mouth. I liked getting a bunch of sports (or a similar theme) because then I knew which pacifiers where which sizes as I was finding them around the house to transition them out.
I always find that once a pacifier is on the floor it needs to be washed. With the pacifier tree I can do a bunch of pacifiers at once, without the hassle of washing them one at a time. Not only is this is great time saver but also helps keep the pacifiers sanitary.
This is the only pacifier my baby will take (thank you green hospital pacifier). I am just grateful that the soothie comes in more colors now. The pink and purple ones are great and very girly. I'm a fan of anything that lets strangers see that my baby is a girl. :)
this suit worked it's magic on my 6 month old i highly recommend it every time we put it on him he knows it's bedtime it keeps him comfy cozy and he doest get hot in it and he is a hot baby and it's 109 degrees where we live we keep his room nice and cool with a fan
Have twin 5 month old boys and this pacifier is the best in aiding us in distinguishing whose is whose and best of all...it's hard to lose! It's also easy for the boys to hold which is great since they are just now grasping with their hands and discovering textures.

My little one loves these pacifiers! He refuses to accept any other. They are so flipping adorable too! The little button design makes you wanna smooch your baby incessantly. These also fit well with the Mam paci holders (also a great product). Little one votes YES.
i was in a bad accident and my arm had broken, i was in a coma and my arm didn't heal right and brakes can leave body parts extra chilly in cold weather... i don't like having to wear long sleves so i got toddler leg warmers top wear on my arms and they really help!
My baby girl had open heart surgery when she was 11 weeks old, and one of the nurses recommended the Wubbanub because my daughter loves her paci. The very first time she used this after we got home, she curled her arm around the caterpillar and fell asleep. So cute!
this product is a very safe concept. i did try other colors and did not like them as they were too glossy for my taste. i did love the white because it looks better to me. it does have some of the glossy satin on the edges but is not as noticeable in the white color
exactly what the original package came with. our son got a hold of it too many times and knocked it off his crib. so we needed a replacement for the one that broke. picture and sound are great. a great buy for us being new parents and having an infant down the hall.
I initially purchased one of these for my nephew as part of his Easter basket and he looooves it so much.  Unfortunately he dropped it at the store and it was never found, so Auntie came to the rescue and purchased another one for him and it arrived on time. Thanks!
this product is great and easy to use.  this is the second one i purchased for the second grandbaby.  i was a bit disappointed in the fact that as i was shopping at target, i found the exact same thing for $30 less and whould, of course, not had the shipping charge.
These are great for babies who have a tendency to spit out their pacifier or let it drop when they open their mouth - but aren't old enough to put it back in. While riding in the car seat it helps keep it in the mouth without having to turn around every five seconds.
its a shame that this cradle bumper has received poor reviews just because the reviewers thought it was for a cradle.   we used this bumper with matching sheets every night for my daughter's first three months. it was soft, beautiful, and washed without any problems.
My daughter loves these pacis and now that shes teething she loves to chew them with my finger underneath. Cute colors and delivered on time. Would reccomend to anyone who has a child that is teething that was/is breastfed as they are more like Mom then other brands.
awesome must have for every parent! my grandson loves his!! i recommend this,it may cost a little more but it's worth every penny!! you'll be thankful that you bought it too when those monkeys are distracting your little one and giving you a much needed time out. lol
i purchased this for my wife who was always complaining about our messy car and now she's so happy and absolutely loves it. it's super spacious, good quality material and has done a great job protecting the leather car seat from our very energetic boy's kicking feet!
this mouthpiece has completely stopped my snoring.  i really thought it was a waste of money but believe me, it works!  i have not snored since i have been wearing it.  it does take a while to get use to and has made my jaw sore for a week or so but totally worth it.
I could have thought of a better gift for my lil baby girl. This is a great product, and hard to lose. My daughter is only 2 months old but she manages to hold onto the horse. I would definetly recommendthis product to all who belive in giving their child a pacifier.
my baby loves this and only naps in this!  it's very soothing for the baby, and very secure.  she is 3 months now, and has been using it since she was born.  i can put her in this for a nap and then go take a shower or do chores.  i highly recommend for all new moms!
I was interested in trying the WubbaNub's. Had seen them in a specialty store, but I wasn't convinced they were a good idea. Well, they are. Easy to find in the diaper bag. Easy to put down so the pacifier stays clean. Easy to find in the crib. The tiger is the BEST.
I'm giving this 5 starts because I needed yellow pacis to decorate a  yellow, gray and black diaper cake with and amazon was the only place that had the paci in this color.  It looked gorgeous on the cake, and my son has never taken another paci besides the soothers.
I have never had any of my babies have nipple confusion with these. I have given them to all three of my kids-also they have all spit them out by about 3 months and never wanted another paci after that...could be luck but I like to think it was this awesome pacifier!
I got this pacifier for my grand baby and she loves it. The duck allows her to be able to hold her pacifier for herself. She looks so cute huging the duck while she sucks her pacifier. And when it gets dirty I can just wash it in the machine and sterilze the pacifier
My daughter rejected all pacifiers except this one.  It is the only thing that soothes her and gets her to sleep...she sucks the pacifier while hugging the monkey and stroking his arms.  It is a genius product that has been a lifesaver for me.  Well worth the money!!
my sister in-law lives in nyc and instead of carrying around a sheet or some other product to take to the park for her 5 months old. this was a great product. its small, you can wash it, use it outdoors if you are in the park or beach. i would recommend this product.
What a great little bink espically for new babies.  The binks are nice and small they don't seem like they are covering the whole face like some other ones do.  The seller was amazing!  They had my order delivered in just a few days.  I would use them again for sure!
Great pacifiers besides that the baby loves them. I love them. Because when it's dark in his room and he's yelling and I just need to find his pacifier and put it back in his mouth and can't find it.  But now with the glow in the dark it makes it much easier to find!
My daughter can find these glow in the dark binkies by herself at night (started this at 6 months, right when we gave them to her)! they are awesome. Unfortunately the glow ones are only made in the 6 months and up size, I wish they came in 0+ and 2+ month sizes too.
You can not buy these in stores. They come from a medical supplier.<br /><br />I've tried so many different kinds of pacifiers, and have still ended up with two finger suckers! This pacifier was the closest I ever got to getting my infants to suck well and contently.
my son got this for his first birthday and he adores it.  he cries if we take it away.  he can't even ride it yet.  he pushes it all around the house.  we do have hard wood floors and when he gets it onto carpet it does look a little less fun as it takes more effort.
Buying a pacifier is always hit or miss. Kids are fussy. Thankfully my niece loved this one and it was adorable! Unfortunately the dog got a hold of it, so I had to buy another, but it was worth it! The product came with a cover and didn't break, so I'd recommend it!
i love this as a reusable bag for lunches. don't use it for anything you plan on keeping in there for more than a day- it will stale. it has yet to stain at all and is so easy to clean. i just quickly rub it with dish soap, rinse thoroughly, and let it dry overnight!
This puts a whole new perspective on pacifiers!  I love this product and have ordered three!  From an early age my baby has been able to get his pacifier and put it back into his own mouth.  Plus the plush animal offers a lot of comfort to him.  LOVE LOVE LOVE these!
i got this for my nephew over a year ago.  he was just turning 1.  he still plays with it now.  while some people have mentioned it can tip, my view is it is so low to the ground and soft, it is a great teaching tool for balance.  kids can't live in a vacuum forever!
this chair is cute and cozy, but certainly not for a toddler over three years old. it is much smaller than i thought. however, my little niece loves it, especially the rocking component. just a word of advise, you need a drill to attached the rocking chair component.
I also like these as they are easy to find in the crib in the middle of the night because they glow in the dark.<br /><br />These hold up well to daily use and being put into the microwave sanitizer.<br /><br />These have become baby girls favorite. Pricing was fair.
i love this little bag. i use it to contain my reusable menstrual pads and diva cup when i'm out and about. it has a dry pouch (the small one) and a wet pouch (the large one) that work great for carrying both clean and used items. it comes in so many cute prints too!
I bought this when my little girl was a newborn. This is the only one out of many that she has stuck to and prefers and she is now 16 months. I love its old fashioned look and as somone previously stated, it does not alloew for a rash around the mouth like others do.
The wubbanub is the most amazing thing ever made! It works great to always have in the car seat! Even if they don't always need the pacifier part all the time! Lol its really nice for when they spit it out! Much easier to catch before it hits the ground! Love mine! :)
not sure why amazon consider's this as a toy. it asked me to rate it as if it is a toy. this is bedding set!  anyways, bought the whole vroom collection for my son.  really great product.  has the perfect boy colors and designs.  works get with rest of the collection.
my husband and i have found this product to be very helpful and have recommended it to others.  the concept is a little strange the first time you go to use it, but you quickly get used to it.  it also does not upset our newborn daughter as much as an aspirator would.
double as a foot rest for the full laid back kid lifestyle. perfect for the toddlers that like to have their snack and bottle accessible during the stroll around town... come on bob, we have talked about that, this should be included with a purchase of a bob stroller.
These are the best ninnies. My daughters came home from the hospital w that  and I hadn't used it at that point. Tried several ninnies bit she only took this one. I bought so many b the bounce and we loose them a lot. I also don't wanna b in a jam where there is none.
these are great bibs! i love all the patterns. my daughter is always drooling and was always wet. these bibs are so so soft and they keep her totally dry.it is great that they have 2 snaps so i can adjust the bib as she gets older. excellent quality excellent product.
we moved to this from our infant bucket seat and are very happy with it. our 13-month-old is still sitting in it rear-facing (she's 60% for height) and she's very comfortable. lots of padding, she seems comfortable, and it's a super-easy install with the latch system.
I bought this for my son and am exclusively breastfeeding.  I wanted a paci for the times when he just wanted to suck.  He loves this paci and it hasn't caused nipple confusion for us at all.  I'd recommend this for sure to any mom or dad:)  And also the wubbanub...:)
really nice walker, very comfortable for any baby! the colors are very nice! the front tires turn but the back ones don't, maybe it would be even more fun for the baby if the back ones turned also. anyway this is a great walker and my daughter has alot of fun with it!
i must admit i was expecting a low quality product that was durable enough to last a few months, but imagine my surprise that the product was not only beyond my quality expectations but absolutely beautiful. this product is made 10x better than most american products.
cute picture on the mat and large enough to cover a good portion of the table in front of the child.  it sticks well, but can be pulled up at the edges by a child if they are determined.  i just like having something clean to put the food on rather than the table top.
We love that these are BPA free! And they are a great size for young babies. Very flexible and soft, which is awesome- they will not hurt baby Waldner when we rolls on top of them. I love that the handle is stationary and not flip down- baby can always grab it easily.
My daughter is 3 months and she loves this! It stays in her mouth much better than just the soothie by itself! You can tuck it under their blanker to keep it in as well. When they turn their head, its less likely to fall out. And its super cute so she cuddles with it!
bought these for my son a year ago. the design is perfect for toddlers learning to feed themselves. the deep spoon allows them to scoop and no spill as easily-which make meal time easier and fun. liked them so much, we bought sets to keep at grandma and grandpa's too!
these do not spill! they lock! they work like a charm for our one year old daughter. she loves drinking out of them. and i love not having to clean up any spills. no more milky smell on her toys. i do not dislike anything about these. plus they are very easy to clean.
Cuteness. Every little girl, if they are going to have a paci, should be seen with pink and purple. It really does make a difference.  I took the green one out, plopped the pink one in, and I swear she smiled bigger, as if she just knew it was pink and perfect for her.
wanted an affordable monitor to use for my disabled husband.  love the background noise cancelling feature and fact it can be carried around when not plugged in. the vtech monitor has saved me countless hours of concern when i'm not in the same room to hear my husband.
we couldnt get our baby to take *any* pacifier and heard about this brand. the first time she tried it, she was hooked! it's truly a miracle paci and i do believe it mimics the breast in a way no other paci does. it's worth the price to soothe a fussy baby, trust me!!!
Awww Suck-ephant, I miss you.  My son threw this beauty out of his stroller near the Southermost Point in Key West and his momma didn't notice.  Good thing we had Suck-dog, Suck-frog, and Suck-asaurus to fall back on.  These are the best.  The elephant was my favorite.
I just received baby sheep with pacifier and little girl sheep with pink bow.  Both are absolutely adorable.  I love the Serta Sheep and lambs and am so happy to find a place that sells them.  I thank you, Amazon for your good merchandise and fast delivery.    Toby Fox
The animal on the end is not only cute but helps the pacifier stay in place.  It also makes it easier for your child to grab when it falls out of his/her mouth.  The animal does not detach but I have thrown mine in the laundry quite a few times and it has held up well.
Every kid is different, but my little guy has loved his Wubbanubs from day 1. He wraps his little hands around their legs, he hugs it to his body. We try any other pacifier and he spits it out (even the Soothies that are identical to the one attached to the Wubbanub!).
Since the day he was born my son has refused to suck on a pacifier unless it has a stuffed animal attached to it.  WubbaNub is the absolute best, and this monkey is very cute.  I highly recommend buying a few different nubs, because your child won't want anything else!
absolutely love this mirror for the car. large view and very easy to attach. the pivot part attached to the mirror is the best part. you line up the pivot attachment to the headrest and swivel the mirror accordingly to view your baby. i would definitely purchase again!
this is one of the best purchases i have made! it allows me to wear necklaces while toting my daughter around. it distracts her from the real jewelry and she's content chewing on the ring. i would never have thought it would work but it did. highly recommend this item!
How am I on my third kid and only just now considered glow in the dark pacis? Every paci-loving baby needs these! Not only am I able to easily find them in the middle of the night, but my baby has learned to find them also, which means less help from mama. A must-have!
they have just the basics, but they were great.  the signal lights are just bright enough that we can see them during the day, but not so bright that it's annoying at night.<br /><br />we never used the night light function much since the light was pretty unsubstantial.
bought this item for my granddaughter.  her family were going camping for a week and it was perfect.  she loved sleeping in it.  they have taken it to hotels and this week heading to the beach.  my daughter has posted it on facebook as highly recommended to her friends.
i was a bit hesitant to allow my son to play with these.. i was worried that they wouldn't be easy to clean off the tub/walls and would stain. i was wrong! i just used a wet washcloth after he was done and it came right off!! will definitely purchase more in the future!
I love this paci! I always wondered why Wubbanubs existed and what the point of the animal was... until my baby girl came along. She doesn't keep the paci in her mouth that well on her own so we tuck the kitten animal under her arms to keep it secured. These are genius!
My 5 month old grandaughter had gotten one if these. She seems to like it better than any of the others we had tried. Of course we only had one. I found these on line. ordered them and they were delivered within 3-4 days. Service through amazon is always spectacular !!!
great cap!  i bought the pack of 2 blue ones, since most of the bottles we end up buying match those.  so far, they haven't leaked on nestle, dasani, deer park, and aquafina bottles.  they're great in a pinch and we always keep one in our diaper bag and one in my purse.
I love these pacifiers. My daughter has been using them since her first day of life and will refuse any of the traditionally shaped pacifiers. They are a little difficult to keep in their mouth for the first few weeks of life, but I prefer them over traditional binkies.
We originally used the soothie pacifiers...when I discovered these I figured they were the same, just missing the nose - well, my daughter thinks they're different...she won't take the soothies anymore (if all the gumdrops are dirty) so we have to have a STOCK of these!
My baby absolutely loves this. We leave this as her pacifier in her crib and its almost like a security blanket for her. She can hold on to it and feels comfortable. It also helps to keep it in her mouth so you dont have to play the pacifier game until she falls asleep.
these don't leak, they have minimal parts so they're easy to clean, kids can't bite & ruin spout. they've also held up over time. i'm ordering more because im tossing all his other sippies that leak or have been ruined from his teeth. you won't be disappointed in these!
really easy to get in and out of the car, if you need something that moves.  straps are great and easy to get my son in and out of, too.  i recommend loosening and tightening every time you get the child in and out, one pull on the front strap tightens it right back up.
i bought this as a gift on the registry. the recipient had used one in a previous pregnancy and was looking forward to using this again. she said it was very durable and held everything easily. the backpack idea kept her hands free so she could deal with her little one.
so when i ordered this online i was a little unsure about it, but when i received it i was beyond thrilled. it is absolutely beautiful. i had to iron it to make it lay nicely, but that is really the only thing i did and it looks awesome. very good quality for the price.
my wife and i are getting on in years and self balance isn't what it used to be.  i have two of these handles mounted on the shower wall. they grip great and helps one to steady themselves while showering.  i would recommend them for young and old alike for safety sake.
Love these soothie pacifiers. The hospital gave us one free one, and then we were hooked. My daughter does not use a pacifier all the time, but when she does she prefers these. These sterilize easily, and do not have small traps or pieces to get bacteria and nasties in.
Depends on the baby, but these are high quality lightweight BPA free and dish washer safe pacifiers that would would be a very good option to try.  The optional rattle clip is a nice accessory.  It's a good idea to have many options and see which one your baby takes to.
I like how easy this is to catch when my little one spits it out lol! I also like that if he is in the carseat it is easy for him to find and put back in his mouth, I am going to buy a spare one just so we don't have a meltdown! I would recommend this for any parent :-)
I wish I knew about these 3 months ago! This helps keep the binky in his mouth. No more getting up 100 times a night to help him get it back in. Great product. We also bought an elephant, but the giraffe works way better. The elephant doesn't stay in as well. Great buy!!
I buy these all the time as gifts. They are such cute little things, and are always high quality. This one was no exception! It also came with a product tag that had safety and cleaning information, which is nice for new parents. I plan on buying many more in the future.
i love these bags. they are thick and freeze well. as long as they are fully closed, they do not leak. thawing milk is easy in these too and they keep the milk fresh. i hated the l bags, i felt they were too thin and flimsy so i tried these and haven't looked back since.
We previously used the Gerber First Essentials 6-12m Binky.... well they no longer make it and my son would not take anything else.  I did a lot of research and found the UMMY.  Not only did he take it but he prefers it and it is better.  We love this, such a life saver!
i had these nursers when i had my children 20 years ago. so i knew that i had to get some for my new grand baby. would not do without them. i could not find them in any stores. online was my only option. they came shipped as ordered and on a timely basis. thanks so much.
we have been cloth diapering for a little over a month and so far this is my favorite cover.  love the gussets at the legs and the fits works really well on our 5 1/2 month old. we use mainly fitted kissaluvs with it and it's not too bulky.  plus the print is super cute.
they work well and keep things dry. i like that the velcro goes straight across and is firm holding. the gussets are deep and can accommodate cloth and disposable diapers. i use them for a pee holding special needs child and they seem to keep the flooding contained well.
if you are looking for something adorable for a babies first christmas, this is it! i can't wait to give it to my son (stocking stuffer) excellent quality and very soft, i know this will become a favorite lovey. its also a great way to keep a memory of a first christmas!
These adorable little critters have always been a hit with my little girl.  It's probably bad to say but she's two now and I'm still buying them for her to love on.  There soft cuddly and absolutely adorable.  Good quality and hold up through a pretty rough two year old.
We had several types of pacifiers for our little man, and he prefers these by far. I went out and bought extra, so it's definitely worth it to buy in bulk like this. I still would recommend getting a few varieties as your mileage my vary.. but this is what worked for us.
it was worth spending a little extra. this bouncer is awesome. my only complaint is that there's a kind of sharp edge underneath where my son hits his knees sometimes. it just irritates, it doesn't cut or anything. easily fixed with some good old fashioned child proofing.
Absolutely amazing!!! My baby girl loves hers so much!! It's so cute to watch her cuddle and wrestle with it. Also, it's very easy to keep track of!! If you buy this you should buy two so you have a backup when you wash the first one. My daughter hates being without hers.
they're awesome. i wish i had bought them earlier. i do wish they came in a slightly smaller size, meaning the actual surface size. i have a huge 7 month year old and it sort of overwhelms him. also a white bib? why? it stayed white for 2 seconds and now looks disgusting.
The pacifiers themselves are great, I just don't recommend the clear color, they are impossible to find once lost haha. The glow in the dark ones were my favorite for the late nights when they lose their pacis and cry, then you don't have to turn the lights on to find it!
i have no idea if this reduces my son's pain while teething (it's not like he can tell me so himself), but he drools a lot less when it is on. tip for folks who feel weird about the choke hazard debate: loop it twice and put around your little one's ankle. problem solved.
These are very nicely made pacifiers, and we used them with both of our sons.<br /><br />PROS:<br />natural material<br />othodontic<br />sized for new babies<br />good in conjunction with nursing<br /><br />CONS:<br />cat likes to steal these (not the other plastic kind)
unit is awesome it paired to my iphone 5s and ipad 2 using the googo app it sends a nice quality video with audio. only down side is because it connects via wifi you won't get emails or run some apps during it but small price to pay for this little technological treasure.
for some reason our daugter prefers the orthodontic shape and it stays in her mouth better (less spitting out).  Most other orthodontic shaped pacifiers aer made of hard plastic this one is soft/rubbery so it doesnt leave the uncomfortable looking indentation on her face.
The soothie pacifier we got at the hospital is the only one my little guy will take, but he constantly loses it in his carseat.  The Wubbanub allows him to enjoy the paci he loves while giving him a 'toy' to cling to...he's learning to put it back in his mouth on his own.
I had bought a dragon for my son so I decided to get this owl for a friends baby due in march. Slightly bigger than the dragon my son has but its all the same really. Perfect as a toy and soother. I've heard many good things about this product and I recommend to everyone.
This is a really cute pacifier for a baby boy. The nipple is securely sewn to the stuffed animal and doesn't fall off. Stuffed animal is soft and squishy so baby loves to hug and squeeze. Nipple is comparable to soothies' &#34;newborn&#34; pacifier in regards to firmness.
These are the only pacifiers that my boys will use. They're well made and last a good long time (at least until my son bites through the rubber). You can also find these for a little cheaper at your local Wallyworld, but I prefer to buy them at Amazon for obvious reasons.
this horror sound machine is the most awesome thing i have seen in my life you can scary somebody its not<br />one of those fake things this works and its the best 16 dollars i have spend in my life and if you don't have it get it!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />you will not regret it.
Wubbanubs are great and I love the Mary Meyer collection! I've purchased these as gifts for several of my friends and they love them too! My friends say that it is easier to find and harder to lose and they have had no safety concerns with the pacifier. It's a great gift!

My baby prefers the nipple style on these Avent pacifiers and we were pleased that they were not the slanted nipple style as we read not to give those as it can cause latch issues in breastfeeding babies (not sure if that is true but as new parents it's what we went with).
Perfect game! I ended up having to print out more pacifiers because we had a big shower for my sister but no big deal because everyone loved this game the blindfold was just thin cardboard but it fit the kids and adults perfectly! I would definitely recommend this product!
My 6 month old loves it and uses it anytime is teeth start to bug him. I heard some people complain about taste or smell but I think they neglected the instructions on cleaning and boiling. Overall great product that does its job and is a healthy choice for a growing baby.
We got lots of pacifiers through baby showers and gifts, etc... but my husband bought this online and the baby LOVES this one the best! We got a two pack so one stays in his room and the other in the living room with the playard. its definitely his &#34;Go to&#34; paci. :)
I bought this WubbaNub for my great grandson and he loves it. This puppy is small enough for even the smallest of infants. He loves it because it gives him something to hold on to and the nipple is small enough and soft enough for him to use. Glad that I bought it for him.
it is absolutely perfect for what i needed. it's light weight and easily portable. the &#34;tray&#34; slopes when baby is in the seat so there would be no way for me to put a bowl or anything on it but it is perfect for sporting events where i need him playing in one spot.
this is such a great gate or stairs!  i love the fact it swings open for the nature length of the door and there is no bar on the bottom! the lock is simple for parents but i can see why kids would have a difficult mid with it.  i can easily open it while holding the baby.
got this battery after my graco monitor battery ran out after heavy use for two years.  installed this battery without and issues.  recharged without any problems.  works great!  have been using the monitor with the new batteries for about 2 weeks now without any problems.
Thought I wouldn't be a pacifier mom. HA. A few sleepless nights in... We tried different brands, and this was the only paci that our newborn could keep in her mouth! We just happened to get it as a free sample with one of our registries - I will be buying more for backup!
My son loves these! He has trouble keeping a normal pacifier in his mouth. This gives his little hands something to hold onto, and he is able to happily suck on his wubba. Even when he isn't awake he holds onto it. The wubba was also required for his one month photo shoot!
This pacifier simulates like advertised and everything. And its the closest looking nipple to me, as i strictly breastfeed. Ive tried several pacifiers for her but she just wont have it. But to a breastfed baby who likes pacifiers but is picky, this would be great i think.
oh how i love this blooming bath. it's soft enough for a first bath, but completely sturdy.  i found it at target for 19.99, half off the original price of $40. this makes bath time easy and fun, especially for newborns. highly recommend this for any mom. great for photos!
I bought this for my grandson and he does not like any of his other pacifiers now.  It is great because it doesn't fall on the floor as rapidly as other ones and he can hold onto it like a favorite stuffed animal!  Saw it on the Today show and had to have one! Soo cute too.
Great concept, borne no doubt out of the reality that pacifiers tend to be dropped, and when they drop, they bounce to unseen places. These WubbaNubs work so well for both baby and parent. If your child likes a pacifier, this one will help them hold on to it, and play with.
i am obsessed with these bibs! they are very high quality and not to mention adorable! i've ordered 3 different sets and about to order more. please keep making these! :) the owner also emailed me making sure that i liked the product, i thought that was a pleasant surprise.
My son absolutely LOVES his monkey pullypalz.  At this point, it's not so much about pacifier access as entertainment - he loves just pulling on the pacifiers and seeing what happens.  It's fabulous when we're stuck in traffic and he's getting bored.  Highly recommend this!
Adorable stuffed animal pacifiers. My newborn grandson received quite a few trendy pacy's as gifts but this is the only one he will use.  Might be the little animal he can hold on to...I don't know...but had to buy several more as back-ups since he won't use any other kind.
My children are 17 months apart and my older child was still using the Soothies and had them in both pink and green. I was looking for a different color so I could tell them apart and was happy to have found these yellow ones on Amazon. I only wish they sold them in stores!
Love the wubbanubs!  My son has the monkey and we thought we'd get a second one just in case we lose it.  So, we got him this dragon because he was born in the Year of the Dragon.  He loves it and the arms and legs are long enough to tuck under the seat belt of his carseat.
We purchased the Elephant at the same time as the Giraffe, and our baby loves his Wubbanub! Because the stuffed animal keeps the pacifier centered and stable, if he loses it from his mouth, it stays reachable for him to find easily. For a fussy baby, this is a game changer!
I first saw these when my first granddaughter was born but never purchased.  I bought one for my grandson and it is great.  He loves to hold the animal and it helps to keep track of his pacifier.  There are no loose or small pieces on the animal to worry about.  Great idea.
i have two grandchildren (7 & 3) and have had this brand since the oldest was two. through natural wear i had to replace them about six months ago. replaced with another brand that just did not do the job. searched and found the original i had used and working like a charm!
I was very skeptical when i bought this for my 4 month old who has started to teeth. He loves it! it is smaller than i bought it would be but it is just the perfect size for my little man. There is beeds in the feet but it dosnt bother me because it seems well put together.
the inside surface is sealed and waterproof. stitching is present on the outside surface, so if the changing pad needs a good hosing, you will have to let it dry. regardless, it closes easily and is quite portable, fitting into any sort of diaper bag or really even a purse.
Our daughter has used these since birth and loves them.  Now that she's 6 months old, she uses them as a teether too!  We leave two in her crib during naps and at night... the shape allows her to easily find the pacifier, pick it up, and put it in her mouth.  Great product.
My baby loves hugging the lion as he falls asleep and stroking the soft satin mane. He is used to the soothie pacifier, which is wonderful for breastfeeding babies, the way they suck on it does not mess up how they suck on the nipple, which has avoided me very sore nipples!
My 1yr old is crazy about this. She has this and a lamb.  I want to take her off but for now its great. It washes easy with other cloths. It dry's good (air dry or dryer) Its my 1yr olds Best Fiend, so it its still looking good after her day with it I say its a good product.
My daughter loves her Wubbanub. I give this as a gift now to every new mom I know. I don't know if it's good or bad but my 19 month old will not sleep without this so we had to get a backup just in case so we are never without one! It's very soothing to her and she loves it!
Our daughter immediately took to the Wubbanubs (was previously using the Soothie pacifier by itself), and loves them. We love them because they were so much easier for her to learn to place/keep in her mouth herself. And I don't think we even have to mention the cute factor.
Wubbanubs are so perfect for newborns that have a hard time keeping their paci in their mouth... For about 6 months it is all my daughter would take, now I get them for all my friends and family's new babies and they always love them :) not to mention how darn cute they are!
My son is still using them as teethers...they soothed him when he needed it. He just didn't use them for long..as I said earlier, they are not being used by him as teethers. They are bright and attract him easily and are hard enough that he feels good about chomping on them.
I love these pacifiers! Both of my boys have used them and I have been very pleased. The glow in the dark feature is very nice for tracking them down in the dark. I will continue to use this. Brand until my boys outgrow them. They hold up very well and are worth every penny.
first of all i received this 5 days earlier than i expected. as a first time mom i want the best for my little one & many recommended this for me. my little one is due in 6 weeks so i don't know if it's good or not but i've been doing a lot of research & it seems like it is.
i had gone to visit my brother and sister-in-law once, i spent over an hour attempting to open a cabinet.  determined not to suffer that same embarrassment in my own home, i sought out products that were easy for adults but impossible for children.  this is  a great product.
this changing table is great, perfect height (even for my husband who is 6'6&#34;) and it looks really nice in the baby's nursery. we bought the matching crib and it's a great set. basic, no frills, but good looking and sturdy. very easy to assemble, too. very happy with it.
Hilarious! We used this as a stocking stuffer. Everywhere he went, people loved it and wanted to know where we got it. It lasted for quite awhile until he started getting teeth and chewed a hole in it. Definitely glad we bought one though.... totally worth the entertainment!
My 4 month old wouldn't take any other pacifier besides his Soothie, but had such a hard time keeping it in his mouth!  This allows him to either hold on to it or for me to tuck it under his blanket so that it doesn't fall out before he goes to sleep.  And it's so darn cute!
We have tried all the major brands of pacifier and these are the only ones my 3 month can keep in her mouth. They are easy to clean and don't get water trapped in them like some others we have tried. A bonus is that all the designs are cute for girls including the blue ones!
Adorable!! I first heard about these on a youtube when watching videos on baby essentials for my unborn niece/nephew.<br /><br />I love the fact that young babies can easily put this back in their mouths if they lose it during the night. I hope baby likes it when it arrives.
these covers are great for small leaks and they wash well. they can go in the washer and the dryer so you don't have to pick them out of the laundry. i use them with my child and as a teacher of toddlers i suggest them to parents when there child is still learning to toilet.
My baby had one pacifier from the nicu which she loved, and she kept it in place while sucking.  I used others that didn't seem to work for her, until I found these which are the same as what the hospital gave us!  With these she is instantly soothed and falls asleep easily.
In my 'quest' for apacifier my son wouldn't spit out - I bought nearly every brand on the market.<br /><br />I bought this one as a joke.<br /><br />Turned out he liked this one the best, and as a bonus, we got compliments on how clever it was whenever we were out and about.
absolutely love this! great to change my baby on and give him sponge baths. material is really easy to clean up if he happens to have an accident on it. i would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a changing pad.  like it way better than a changing table.
our kids share a room and have a ton of animals, they love to see all their stuffy's &#34;faces&#34; and how easy it is to rotate out weekly favorites to decorate their beds.  the hammock seems very sturdy with the metal hooks and truly holds a bunch of animals as described!
At first our 1 month old didn't really like this but it comes in handy when she's still looking for something to put in her mouth after feedings.  This little gizmo will help put her right to sleep!  It also stays put so she can get it back in her mouth even when swaddled up.
This pacifier is adorable, funny, and well made. The nipple is pretty much the same as NUK pacifiers, which matters if your kid is as picky as mine.<br /><br />This paci actually became a prop for our family portrait when Axel decided he didn't want to have his picture taken.
got this as a gift - was not registered for it. was sort of dubious - however now that we use it - i love this thing. very functional, fits well in the sink - lots of different levels for drying many different things. i would actually buy it again if something were to happen.
my toddler loves this potty. he has been potty trained for almost a year now and we have not had a single accident in public. we carry this in the little bag it comes in inside his back pack. i am thrilled with this and am getting a second one. i am so thankful for this item!
I searched through hundreds of bags online and in the stores, and this is just the bag I have been looking for! It is very nice, has a cute color scheme and is spacious yet lightweight. It comes with all of the essentials inside. I am going to order a second one as a back up!
The little boy loves it. Having teethed he eats pacifiers as he would candy, if permitted. WubbaNub is offered at a good price and are quality product.. He insists on the gobblegoods having a soft cuddly toy, and this one (and the others I ordered like it) is perfect for him.
amazing camera. great battery life if you let it drain all the way before charging it again. zoom feature fantastic for first time parents (is he breathing??). the push to talk button is easy to accidentally push but it doesn't seem to matter. it's so worth the peace of mind.
i bought this bike trailer today. i looked long and hard for a bike trailer that was also a jogging stroller. this one was easy to put together, it's a smooth ride, has a ton of storage space, and takes corners wonderfully. i am very happy so far, and my daughter is ecstatic.
only thing that has worked for my 9 month old. overnight diapers leaked. sizing up leaked. double diapers leaked. pull-ups over regular diaper leaked. we put this inside a regular diaper and it works! we do fold it in half and put it in the front since she is a tummy sleeper.
I purchased this pacifier for my new granddaughter and we were pleasantly surprised at the quality and cuteness. It feels well made and is much better looking in person then in the photo. I will most likely be buying more so we always have one on hand for our little princess.
This is the standard symmetrical ortho nipple design. My baby preferred Nuk first, but now likes this one too. I love that, unlike Nuk, this one curves outward, so it doesn't leave a ring on my baby's fat cheeks. It also has plenty of holes for airflow so it doesn't irritate.
good price for under $6 each. also like that one side is waterproof and the other side is fabric (cotton i think). and the size is spot on - not too small and not overly large as to be cumbersome. folds well so you can put it in your diaper bag. haven't needed to wash it yet.
this lovely monster is the best friend of my daughter! easy to use it, trend bright colors, and the most importent thing-  i have no problems with snacks scattered around the house! daughter can not open the the cap itself, but soft monsters teeth make it easy to get cookies!
these are fantastic and very affordable. we used the newborn size for the first 1-2 months, then the infant size. we first used them traditionally with snappis and covers and now we still use the infant size to stuff our pocket diapers. very absorbent and work great both ways.
This little stuffed animal is about the size of an understuffed Beanie Baby....perfect for tiny little fists to hold. And the pacifier is permanently attached...so, it's easier to see when it's gone overboard! Ingenious! I think it arrived about 2 or 3 days after I ordered it.
love it! little pouch that i use to store pacifiers and wipes in the diaper bag. not really big enough to be a true &#34;wet bag&#34; in the cloth diapering sense of the word. however, you could use it for cloth wipes! :-)<br /><br />keeps all paci's safe and easy to access!!!
easy to fold and open in less than a minute. wipe down to clean and great for my now crawling little one so he can play at the park. i compared this brand to others before purchasing and checked out friends who already own it and spoke highly of it. definitely would recommend!
Buy as many as you can get. These are GENIUS. Keeps the Soothie from rolling away or getting lost in the diaper bag. Also makes it a lot more fun for baby - he quickly learned how to hold and retrieve his own soothie without having to use clips or anything. LOVE these so much.
This collections storage box easily fits in my pantry for storing plastic spoons, forks, napkins etc. Love the color.  Looks very pretty.  Could be used as storage under a sink or even to store magazines.  Pretty enough to have in your living room.  Very pleased with purchase.
This is the best pacifier on the market.  This is the type that they gave us in the hospital and my daughter won't use anything else.  We had other one's around but she always grabs this one.  It's nice also that it comes in other colors other than green.  We really love them.
cute little book that is fish shaped. there are only a few cloth pages but just enough to keep the 13 month old entertained. it's a good size that she likes to open it and study each page. we've seen her tell a story in her way then she laughs and claps as she turns the pages.
my favorite bottle cleaner.  med soft bristles easily bend to get into a small bottle top, then bristles on top reach edges easily on the inside.  tried a couple others that were just annoying.  this one is our favorite!  the stand was nice and helpful to keep it clean and dry
these bibs are amazing. easy to wipe off, can toss them in the dishwasher to clean also. the pocket catches everything. and it adjusts around baby's neck so that it can grow with them. i bought more to keep at my sitter's because i can not be without one of these at mealtimes!
this pillow was a bit smaller than i expected, however, it does exactly what it should do.  we even used it to help prop up the bassinet  mattress to help with keeping the little one breath better.  nothing fancy, just a pillow with a cover that does the job it was made to do.
The case they come in acts as a sanitizer, which is a nice addition. You just fill with water to the level and microwave for 3 min. They are very sturdy and love the color/design for a baby boy. If you have an infant &#62; 6 months, I would strongly recommend checking this out.
i purchased this when my son was twelve weeks old, and he could already reach the toys. it is soft and padded and the hanging toys have different textures and noises to keep baby entertained. my favorite feature is that the gym folds up and zips closed for ultimate portability.
these little diaper covers are well-made, sturdy, and attractive. the design used to make the velcro-style closure tabs is ingenious. they are double sided, so one will stick to the other if you need to overlap them for a better fit on a smaller baby! i absolutely love these!!!
This is the only pacifier our newborn will take & it's a lifesaver!  Ordered more the second we saw she liked them.  I do wish that you were able to choose the design, as we got the boy's. However, they all work the same, and we purchased for function.  The blue are still cute!
We love our Wubbanub! Our twins are 4 months old and they love to grip onto their stuffed animal while sucking on their paci.  Also, we seem to not loose it nearly as often, then when their pacifier is alone. The animal is super cute and the perfect size for their little hands.
i'm so happy to have found this bottle/sippy cup for my baby! i wanted to stay away from plastic bottles and this was the answer. very well made and sturdy. also well thought out with there being no plastic parts, even when adding in the optional straw pura offers. very happy!!
I wish I would have bought this sooner!  It's a life saver if you have a child who is pacifier dependent!  If your child spits it out while driving  You can find it with ease and stick it back in their mouth.  Plus it acts as a stuffed animal helping them sleep better at night.
we use this in our strolller and it is great!  we just leave it in there all the time, so we don't have to worry about bringing a blanket or having a blanket fall on the ground.  when it's warm, we just tuck the top of the cover under our baby's feet.  it's a wonderful product.
Everyone just thinks this thing is the best. He is soooo cute! Out little boy loves it as well, though at 12 weeks, he is starting to associate it with bedtime and fights like no other! The only thing I worry about is how to wash it? The paci dos not disconnect from the stuffy.
This was my 1 year old's mustache for the mustache and pizza party I through for her and her sister (who turned 13.) Since she couldn't have a sticker mustache, I thought this might work even though she doesn't do pacifiers. She loved it, everyone loved it, and it was adorable.
My 4 month old loves this pacifier! We started out with just a frog wubbanub, but needed another for when we needed to clean the frog. My daughter loves to take the bunny out of her mouth to look at it and then put it back in her mouth! She loves to chew on the bunnies ears. :)
a pump bra is a must if you plan on pumping at all.  this one is not pretty, but it's super functional.  i would usually put it on over a zip-up sweatshirt to keep warm while pumping, so the adjustable feature is nice.  this thing is a brilliant invention.  you won't regret it.
I have a new grandniece.  I bought these pacifiers along with some others of a different brand.  Every time I saw her she had this same pacifier so I asked the parents why were they changing up the pacifiers and they said that this is the baby's favorite pacifier.  Who knew??!!
Perfect fit for baby's hand. Soft and graspable. Wash and air dry. Although I have washed and dried these in a standard washing machine. Easier to catch if thrown toward the floor, and children can identify who's WubbaNub is who's. I recommend having 2 of each animal per child.
My 4 month old loves her Wubbanubs! She has the yellow ducky and the Mary Meyer giraffe. When she's not using the paci, she's cudding with the little stuffed animal, especially when she sleeps. And now she's figuring out how to put it back in her mouth if it falls out. So cute!
Keep in mind these are for 3 month old babies! They are not the hospital gumdrops (Hawaii Medical). My daughter loves these. I'm not keen on how they looks, it's not really the cutest thing to see a tunnel in your child's mouth. But they help her sleep, therefore I love them. :)
this is a great product for the price.  i love the auto mute feature and the feature which allows the screen to time out until sounds are made.  our previous monitor didn't have theses features and made it really hard to get a good night's rest.  i highly recommend this product.
don't know what i'd do without these. we have a bunch of avent soothies that just sit now because these nuk pacis are the only ones she really likes, AND they don't fall out of her mouth as easily so we don't have to constantly be putting the paci back in her mouth as she cries.
People keep complaining that these pacifiers lose their glow but all you have to do to re-charge it is set it by a source of light (light bulb, night light, etc) for a while and then it will glow again good as new. Love these pacifiers and the glow in the dark feature is genius.
my daughter loved this pacifier/toy combo.  easy to hold, soft and plush, oh so cute!  and i liked that the pacifier was similarly shaped as a nipple, in my mind (not scientifically proven) it helped avoid nipple confusion and did not hinder my daughter's breast feeding ability.
My son's only &#34;lovey.&#34; Great quality, super cute. Just wish there was a way to remove the pacifier without cutting it off. We are eventually going to need to wean our son from the pacifier part, but would still like to keep the monkey around since it's his security item.
I probably paid way too much for this wubbanub, but I thought it would be so cute for my little boy - and I was right! The dragon is my favorite of all of his wubbanubs. It looks like the picture, except the wings are actually more blue than purple. (I like blue better, anyway.)
These are the best pacifiers on the market.  They are the ones the hospital sent home with us and my son is attached!  No other binky will work for him.  They are soft and durable.  Yes, they bounce when dropped, just buy some pacifier wipes or a wubbanub and you are good to go.
my 4 month old had problems holding in pacifier during sleeping and we had to get up multiple times during the night to put pactifier in...this product stays in much better than a regular pactifier and she loves it! it puts her right to sleep...and now she can put it in herself!
my cousin bought this for our first baby and we hadn't even thought of brushing gums/first teeth so it wasn't on our registry or anything. it was very nice and gentle on her teeth, and she is already well-trained at brushing teeth by 2 years old. i think it helps to start early.
We love these pacifiers for our daughter.  The rubber is so great for her and easy to clean.  I don't have to worry because it's all one piece.  We do use these for longer than they recommend, but you can tell they begin to change and become a bit waterlogged.  Highly recommend.
My 8 month old has refused pacifiers his whole life. Lately, he has struggled to stay asleep at night. I, in a desperate attempt, decided to try a pacifier again. I bought the MAM brand and he actually loved it, and he slept all night long! Relief! I'm one happy mom. Thanks MAM!
my favorite bathtub.... i used for my 2 babies and gave to my 2 sisters and they loved it. easy and small to take anywhere. my babies were very comfortable and you can put on top of small spaces like sink, countertops, bed or anywhere that is confortable for moms back. great buy
So, my newborn son has a tiny tongue and is NOT a fan of these.  That being said, they're still amazing pacifiers.  My daughter used them for 10 months and would take no other.  The caps are easy to get on and off, the handle is a good size, and they were easy for her to handle.
I LOVE these. They're all I use for my binki-addicted baby. She can even hold onto the bear and is figuring out how to put it in her mouth. They're great for car trips because you can put the arms through the straps to hold the binki in--- which makes car rides that much easier!
I needed a wet bag for home so that I wouldn't have to run up stairs with a soiled flip insert in hand. This works great for what I need it to do, so far no complaints.  Not sure if I would trust this in a baby bag, because it is very thin, but I am happy that it suits my needs.
My son will only take a pacifier like the one given at the hospital. I was so excited to see this toy/pacifier. He's now 3 months and loves this! He can move his pacifier to his mouth himself, something he could not yet do w/o the attached toy. As a bonus, the puppy is too cute!
Item as described, received on time, in good condition. Will buy again from this seller.<br /><br />I just wish the pacifier was removable. My daughter likes a different brand, but I wanted the doll, so I cut the one it came with off and sewed her favorite brand on. Works great!
We live in San Diego, California and are huge Denver Broncos fans. All we could find around here in local stores is Chargers gear for our baby. (Boo) So being able to find it on here for the price is great! Happy with the product. Can't wait til our little one is here to use it!
This is the only pasi my daughter would take and still uses. I have it multiple colors but amazon is the only place we could get yellow. These are a pain when she throws from her crib as they roll under everything and it's become a game in our house to see who can find the pasi.
These pacifiers SUCK!  Yes, in the best way possible.  They are easy to clean because water does not get trapped in them.  And you can watch baby's little mouth suck on them.  For teethers, this pacifier is great because you can stick your finger in there for a little extra chew!
All the babies in our area receive this pacifier at the local hospital when they are born.  My daughter loves it. In fact she only likes this pacifier and we have tried others.  I would recommended this paci to all!  The funny looking pacifiers are loved by all the babies I know.
these are the go to pacifiers for us. we had them at the hospital and swear by them. i recommend them to everyone i know who is having a baby. the only issue we have is if you have pets, the material does attract hairs easily. but that isn't something a wipe or washing can't fix!
Great, at first my lil boy didn't pay much attention to it, but now it's his favorite paci, he holds the toy and hugs it to sleep, so sweet!<br />The only issue is that I cannot sterilize it as other pacifiers, I have to boil water and hold it some time in it, but it worth it! ;)
my daughter received her bag in brazil this week... we loved it !<br />i am pregnant too and i regret not to get 2 sets...<br />great quality !!<br />we are happy with purchase and the way they treat the client!<br />thank you !<br /><br />looking forward to get a new set soon ;)
My 3rd, and last baby, is a bon-ified pacifier baby! And I don't have a problem with it :) He looooooves these pacis. He will not take anything else, and won't even take the &#34;wrong&#34; color of pacifier. They definitely soothe him and he uses them mostly at nap and bed time.
i first bought these for my three month old granddaughter which she loved.  one day when her 9 month old cousin came over for a visit she shared one of her teether with him and he loved it.  so i had to ordered him some. they have other teether but they always come back to these.
My daughter is in love with these she won't use any other type of pacifier (she's only 3 months) and we've been using these since she was about 2 weeks. Also the handles glow in the dark which is super great for rolling over when she drops it and being able to see it in the dark.
My son loves his puppy wubbanub! He's always had it but after he turned 2 we snipped off the pacifier so he could still snuggle with his puppy and rub the little ears on it. I think it made getting rid of the pacifier a much easier process! Every night he has to have his puppy :)
these are a little expensive, but they are worth it. they cover more area than most other ones & the are made well. they look & feel like they will last 50 years. i get asked about them anytime someone sees them in my truck. i worry less now about my rear seats getting messed up.
Love these bottles and pacifiers! My baby is breast fed and took to these bottles perfectly. She doesn't seem to get much air when feeding and I love the designs. Pacifiers are the same as bottle nipples so transition between the two are not really noticeable for baby. Great set!
Love this pacifier!  Just like the ones given to us in the hospital and the baby loves to hold onto the caterpillar.  We introduced it around 3 weeks old, but up until about 6 weeks old, she could not hold onto it.  Now, at 7 weeks, she does not let go of this Cutsie Caterpillar.
I bought these a couple of months ago and are working fine.  I saw a couple of reviews that say they didn't last long.  Not to sure about that.  My child doesn't use them all the time but have been fine so far.  They are just like the picture and look cute when your child uses it.
We love the WubbaNub!  We had a few for my daughter and have had a few now for my son.  They make it so you don't have to chase a constantly falling pacifier and the weight from the animal helps to keep it nearby as baby starts to learn to use their hands.  Highly recommend these!
my daughter and i love these bibs for her  little girl/my granddaughter.  they catch all her spills and are a breeze to wash up by just rinsing under the faucet.  they fit her well time and make lunch time fun and easy to clean up.  we would definitely highly recommend these bibs!
Crazy expensive and hard to find, but I suppose there's a reason for that.  My kids love these, and I'm glad because the two-piece ones gross me out.  These are very easy to clean.  Trivial fact-- one of my twins prefers his upside-down, and it looks like a little mustache.  Cute.
We live in New Zealand and can't buy this product.<br /><br />I look after babies straight from hospital until they are placed for adoption. They have these pacifiers in the hospital but are unavailable anywhere else. They are a wonderful product and will buy more at a later date.
i purchased these bandana bibs for my nephew, and they look really cute. since he's teething, he is always drooling, but the bibs keep his clothes dry, and they keep him comfortable. they are soft and very comfortable. my sister is always getting compliments on how cool they look.
I use the small bag for liners that wash separate from cloth when we are out and about. I can also use it to dispose wipes if a trash is not nearby when I change baby, it is very small. The larger bag is adorable, and fit 4 diapers at least with room. Nice quality, and good price.
My daughter is 3 months and she LOVES her kitty :) this is the only paci she can put back in her mouth herself when it falls out and hold in place. She's still developing her motor skills do she can't always get it in but I don't have the problem where the paci falls on the floor.
this little guy goes everywhere with us. even though my son has stopped taking a pacifier i still stick him in the car seat with him. in fact, he is in his bed right now. i think i might even remove the pacifier eventually and hand sew him back up. i highly recommend this product.
My daughter lives her soothies.  They seem to be the only pacifiers she will actually keep in her mouth for long enough to calm herself.  Only down side is they do not have covers, so the pacifier can get kind of dirty...meaning you can't just throw Ina diaper bag and/or stroller.
A great soothie, very sturdy and durable. My baby loves this and will not go anywhere without it. I love that it is a bright color so its really hard to misplace it, unlike other ones that I have had which my kid would lose or hid frequently. I definitely recommend this pacifier!!
Every OU football fan will want these cute Sooner pacifiers for their baby! The baby hasn't arrived yet, so I can't attest to how well he will like them, but I have pulled and twisted on them to be sure they won't fall apart. They look great, no sharp edges, and delivery was fast.
my baby loves this soother. when we put him down in his crib we always turn it on and he loves to stare at it, and sometimes gets up and kisses it... he loves his nemo. the ocean sounds are also great and seem to sooth baby to sleep once he's done with all the kissing and staring.
this is the best set for a little one. specifically, i buy it for the comb. it gets out all the tangles but doesn't scratch my little ones head. the brush was good when she had little hair because the bristles are so soft it was nice on her head. now it just makes her hair frizzy.
very easy to put together and my baby loves it so far.  good quality and very sturdy.  i can't wait until he starts jumping on in.  a must buy if you are looking for a great product.  we bought the exersaucer but will return it as the quality is very poor compared to the jamperoo.
These are awesome until your vhd can chew them, or the dog -_- none- the less I've purchased at least 15 of these from them being destroyed or lost. They're a great product highly reccomend them. Wish I could get my two year old to stop taking a paci though (yea they're that good)
these car seat's are awesome and well worth the money!!  they are a breeze to install and easy for the child to nap in comfortably without their head falling forward like in most car seats.  i bought this for our second car because we love the one we have in our first car so much.
For all three of our kids, soothie was the only paci they would accept. So, when we found this lovie and paci set we knew we'd like it! Our two month old enjoys the paci and will wrap her tiny hands around the little lamb lovie. I imagine this will quickly be the favorite for her!
I love these but hard to find to order sometimes so when I do find them I usually order a few.  These were used in the hospital for my newborn so I figured I would purchase and extra set.  They are such a nice product for babies.  They seem to work out better then other pacifiers.
i received this item less than 24 hours after ordering it.  unbelievably fast service.  and the pacifier is adorable.  my daughter loves to grab the caterpillar and hold it up close to her face.  she isn't good at getting the pacifier back in her mouth but she just turned 3 months.
bought this for my friends baby when he was a newborn (he is now a few months over 1 year old) and now this is the only nook he will use.  He has gotten plenty regular ones as presents and just spits it out.  This thing is the only thing that will stop him from crying. He loves it.
i love that it only weights 10-11 pounds. it's much easier to get into my car. the only downside is that if the baby isn't in the stroller, sometimes it will to over ( if you've put things in the handle). empty, it can handle the disorder bag, but not the disorder bag and my purse.
just wanted to say i had a very very very positive experience with albeebaby in terms of return of this item and obtaining a replacement. albeebaby has a customer in me for life. they were very responsive and  sent the replacement stroller timely with the minimum of fuss. thank you
this gate works perfectly for the top of our stairs. i followed the directions that came with the gate and it took about 30 minutes to put it up. it is very sturdy even when my little one (about 30 inches tall) tries to climb up it (which he can't) and tries to shake open the gate.
best pacifiers ever, and they glow in the dark which rules because my kids have always been able to find them in the crib, never had that problem of baby looking for paci and not finding it in the dark, never ever. so grateful, one less reason to wake up in the middle of the night!
I love this bottle warmer.  After researching different warmers I settles on this one.  I use Avent bottles but could not bring myself to spend 40 bucks on the Avent warmer.  I only paid 20 bucks  and it works great.  I love the automatic shut off and it warms my bottles perfectly!
There isn't much more to say about wubbanub pacifiers, other than that they are simply amazing. They help keep up with the paci when it goes flying across the room. It's easy to clean and wash it, and my kid absolutely loves it! We have three different animal versions of this paci!
SO HAPPY with this wabanub! The colors are GREAT and it's so soft. Baby hasn't come yet, but that didn't stop me from playing with it on my 38 week belly and describing it to the baby. My husband thought I was crazy, but I was seriously excited about how cute this turned out to be!
We use this pacifier pod all the time. I had originally bought it to attach to the diaper bag but instead we have it on our daughter's carrier and it is so handy especially while riding in the car. I turned it inside out, machine washed it and laid out to dry and it holds up great!
My daughter would not take the regular &#34;soothies&#34; pacifiers (our older daughter loved those). We tried these because they were a tad smaller, both in length and circumference,  and she preferred these. Good deal to buy 5 right off the bat instead of those single or 2 packs.
The design for these pacifiers is great, very easy to clean. Most we've had have a space where water gets trapped and starts looking gunky after a week or two. So when we got these, everything is open so I can wash them as often as I need without the water getting trapped anywhere.
i bought this toy for my 6 month old grandson for christmas. he absolutely loves it! he has the football and why not add the round oball. what i like about this ball.... it's easy to handle.... he could grab it with his chubby little fingers!  i would definitely recommend this toy.
i bought two additional sets, for a total of three sets. these are great for cereal, noodles, anything. portion amount doesn't make me second guess if the kids are eating too much or not enough. the ones that came to me are the pink and green flower and butterfly designs, both sets.
i ordered this for my new little nephew.  my husband saw it and thought i had ordered it for our little boy.  he loved it so i guess i will have to order another one.  it comes in a gift box that is covered with baseballs.  the box is just as cute as the gift.  absolutely loved it!!
Baby is straight addicted to these pacis. Easy to sterilize, and super cute design options. Mainly use while he is sleeping....when he wakes up in the middle of the night - he will search in his crib to find the paci, and will instantly fall asleep when he puts it back in his mouth.
These are the only pacifiers my daughter will use when she is REALLY tired. We've tried every other brand out there, even similarly shaped. While on occasion she'll take a different paci, when it comes down to actually falling asleep, these are the only ones that have worked for us.
my 2 1/2 year old and 16 month old boys use this table all the time! i painted it and put polyacrylic (spelling?) on it and put laminate tiles on the table top and chair surface so it's easy to keep clean.  also used wood glue when assembling which i'm sure made it much more sturdy.
Wubbanubs saved me from waking up twice a night to help my daughter find her pacifier. Trust me, if you are considering buying this for your child, DO SO RIGHT AWAY! My daughter uses 2 of these at night and I have never had to wake up at night again :).<br />Happy baby = happy mommy
this was my lifesaver in the hospital when i hadn't yet learned how to swaddle with regular blankets. looks super cute and keeps baby's arms in place :) my only complain was that it was too warm for summer. for colder weather the thickness of the fabric would be an advantage though!
great potty seat.  urine does get on the regular toilet seat after using it tho so you have to remember to wipe it off unless you want to sit in pee, lol.  besides that, it's awesome.  fits the toilet well.  fits every toilet well since it's adjustable.  i'd definitely buy it again.
Would recommend to anyone!  Keeps the pacifier from instantly landing on the floor and bouncing around when baby lets go.  My baby is also able to get it back in her mouth sometimes on own!  Great product!  Only complaint is that it's harder to clean (obviously) than usual pacifier.
She used it to help her go to sleep and she likes it. Water get's into the nipple when washing so just need to squeeze the nipple to get the water out and then push the nipple to one side and while holding in that position shake the water out. This works well to keep the paci clean.
perfect gift for my godchild and she loves it while playing dress. got it in 2013 for xmas and it still looks brand new from daily play dress up. she was three and is going on five. great gift for the busy child!!!! assembly is what her dad does!!!! no nicks or scratches even today.
Exactly what I was looking for! I wanted to match the pacifier that was given to us in the hospital as the nipple was similar to the nipple shield we were using as well (trying to avoid any nipple confusion!). These were exactly the same as the pacifiers we received in the hospital.
i was looking everywhere for a water frog bath toy and this was perfect!  the frogs are made very durably, bright and cheery looking.  very adorable, very perfect.  little rings are perfect size for baby frogs to sit on in the water!  looks like a great pool/bath toy for the babies.
the best 30 bucks i've spent! my little bub was screaming her head off right before i put her into the carrier and once she sits right in, boom! smiles all round!! and she'll still keeping still and happy as i write this review!! can't think of any downsides yet! good job infantino!
I bought this one and the lamb for my twins and I love them. Their easy to find when dropped in the car seat and great when their swaddled at night. They are also good when they are on the swing. If they fall out when they are sleeping they don't go far and you can always find them.
It is a great idea and works perfectly. My baby takes medicine better with this pacifier. There is one thing that I do not like, the hole on the bottom of the pacifier (through which the babies suck the medicine out) is a little bit too big, it is too easy to be choked by the liquid.
i love this thing; it's so cool how it turns on as soon as it touches water! i think my baby will love it too once he's old enough to enjoy baths and play with toys. the only downside is that it remains lit up if not properly dried off and i worry that the batteries will die quickly.
love it<br />yes, i would tell anyone wanting to buy something unique this is it<br />when the baby gets fussy or waiting for a bottle i use this to keep them quiet<br />3-4 times a day or when ever you need it<br />just a plain old pacifier<br />the quality was above my expectations
these were perfect for our new baby. a little bulky for a newborn, but i'm glad i bought these instead of newborn size which would have been outgrown very quickly. perfect for stuffing nearly any diaper cover, very absorbent, and also great for spit rags, napkins, cleaning rags, etc.
This is one of those baby products that you use EVERYDAY! This is our 3rd wubbanub and my 6 month old loves it. It has different textures that he loves to feel and when he is not sucking on the pacifier, he is chewing on the monkey's legs. We LOVE wubbanubs-this one is just adorable.
our six month old baby picked up our older son's cup and was able to drink with ease from the straw.  the fun design attracts our children and they reach for the lollacup over our other straw sippy cups.  the adorable design and ease of use and cleaning make this a wonderful product.
This puppy is so adorable. My little 3-month-old can't consistently and steadily hold his Soothie pacifier with his hand, but he has no problems holding the puppy and helping the pacifier stay in place. Soothie is his favorite pacifier so it's really nice to have this little product.
My little one was originally attached to the Gerber pacifiers with the blue, pink, or white plastic piece. But she only liked the larger size. They stopped making those after she became attached so I had to find a replacement.  These did the trick! She loves these and they feel safe.
Very cute and as described item, on time delivery ..<br />Not only looks cute but also it has bulb-like teet or nipple which my baby prefer, whenever I go shop for pacies I need to check the teet to make sure it's not the straight one (this didn't show in the description of the item)
Really nice little carrier keeps pacifier at hand (easily attaches to diaper bag strap) and clean.  Provides a way to keep from digging at the bottom of the diaper bag for pacifier.  I love that I had such an assortment of colors to choose from.  There's a color/pattern for everyone.
This little guy is so much cuter in real life! He is seriously adorable. My daughter isnt a huge fan of pacifiers, so we havent gotten as much use out of this item as I hoped, but I have washed it a handful of times in the washing machine (in a lingerie bag) and it still looks great!
i bought this for my daughter who is expecting her first baby in 3 weeks. they tested it out and they are pleasantly surprised at how clear reception and picture clairity is. i felt it was a saftey feature as their master is on the 1st floor and the baby's room will be on the second.
My son did not like this. That is not to say it's a bad Product, soothie type pacifiers just don't work for him. This is well made and clean and he did enjoy holding the giraffe portion, even if he didn't make use of the pacifier. Perfect size for an infant to practice holding items.
My grandson loves it and also WebbaNub Clifford. These were so much easier for him to put back in his mouth than just the pacifier which would disappear in his crib or stroller.<br /> Sometimes he carries around both!! Altho, now he is 14 months old and still is carrying them around.
These are the kind we got in the hospital and the only kind my son would take. There are other pacifiers that are similar, but are a little more stiff and he wouldn't take them. These are a favorite. Our local store is always out of stock so I don't even bother looking there anymore.
We love our wubbanub!  Makes it so much easier to keep up with our daughter's pacifier.  In the car when she drops it... it's easy to find and we don't have to dig around in her carseat to figure out where it rolled off to!  She likes to hug and hang on to it as well.  Two thumbs up!
i thought this was the coolest thing when i found it and come to find out, i've used it once. it works perfectly fine exactly like the directions but would be a waste if you're not chopping food everyday anyways. if you have babies and have to chop everything then it would be perfect.
[[asin:b000v6yi6a playtex baby straw cup replacement short straws: 6-pack]]    excellent product. straw replacements were a life saver to me. i didn't want to buy new cups, but i had lost a few straws and my kids had chewed up a few, so this was the perfect solution. highly recommend.
I give these to all my friends who have babies.  I don't know if they appreciate the gift, but it makes me laugh and besides, everyone else is going to give them precious blue or pink or gender-neutral binkies, but what could be more gender-neutral than a red and black vampire binky??
My daughter is 10 weeks old she loves the Gumdrop pacifiers, she won't take anything else.  We used the Soothie brand as we were given it in the hospital but they are too big and round and the Gumdrops fit their little faces just right.  I am recommending this product to all new Moms.
its a good size bag. my baby is too young for the carrier so i have not try out that feature yet.  the yellow is more highlighter yellow than the orange yellow in the picture. also even though the item says bliss the item shipped is the delux. if you don't mind yellow its a great deal
these are incredibly soft (much softer than any other brand i've tried), thick enough to prevent leaks and launder much better than i was expecting...they still look new after months of washing. would recommend a larger quantity if using daily...i immediately wished i had bought more.
My little girl loves to hold on to things when she is upset, and using her pacifier. This bear made it so easy for her to hold and grasp, plus I was able to switch out the pacifier to which ever one she wanted at the time... truly very cute and I am buying another one for my nephew :D
i absolutely love this car seat!  it's sturdy and easy to use.  it fits in our smaller sized car with no problem.  our little guy is super comfortable in it.  the only thing negative thing i will say (although, i don't mind); being 5'1 and lifting it in to our suv, it is pretty heavy.
We love how simple the Avent soothie pacifier is, perfect for newborns and infants. These are BPA free and are the #1 hospital recommended. Typically the hospital has them there in the green color and since we are having a girl this time, I am bringing the pink/purple one from home :)
Great price! We bought this because we kept loosing binkys. We have endless supply now :) it's been 3 months and we still have one unopened pack! Just be careful if your child has teeth. My son managed to bite a hole in one but no rubber was missing. I think it's normal wear and tear.
My son loves is paci, and so do I. I especially like the idea of how its made. Safety comes first and with this design choking hazards are very rare. I also like that if it falls on the ground it rarely touches the nipple because of its wide outer rim! Number 1 paci you can't go wrong.
My kid is obsessed with those wubbanub pacifiers which is fine except they cost like $13. Because I would like to send my child to college, I am unable to buy the requisite 13 or so she would like to have. These soothies are the same pacifiers used on wubbanubs and are good in a pinch.
i love this sheet/pad for my play yard.  when it came out of the wrapper i thought i had made a mistake and that it was too small, but it fits well, pads the mattress so that my granddaughter sleeps all night and i know that if she has an accident i can just pull it off and keep going.
My son loves his Bull Nuk as we call it.  Doesn't bounce away so it's easy to find, and stays on his chest in the stroller.  I toss the whole thing in the laundry with no problems.  We get so many compliments on it.  A bit bulky for nighttime sleeping, so we only use it during the day.
i bought this pacifier for my little boy's first birthday mustache bash!!! it was so cute!!!!  everyone just loooved it!!! it is well designed! it really makes it look like he had a mustache:) and the pacifier was nice as well,plus it comes with a cover for it! definitely recommend it!
my parents got this swing for our daughter and it's great! it plugs in the wall so no need for batteries which is nice. it has so many different settings and options which is also nice! i like the fact it has  mirror for her to look up at and how the little toys circulate. great swing!
My 9 week old has been sucking on these since he was two weeks old!  We have tried several other kids just to see what he likes and he prefers these.  They also seem to stay in his mouth better than any of the other brands and don't require an adult hand to always keep it in his mouth.
We love it!!!!  Our daughter is 5 weeks old. She hates most pacifiers. Really hate the soothies, and orthodontic shaped pacifiers. She would only take the mam style. She is breastfed only. If you have a similar baby they may like this. She latched onto this paci after about 10 seconds.
loved these as a new mom! i had trouble with engorgement and over production of milk. these fit right in my bra and worked with assisting in letdown (using warm) and then using the cold to help with pain after feeds.  i also loved using them warm when i have had a couple blocked ducts.
My daughter never liked pacifiers, but this one has found a new life as her favorite thing to chew on since she was 5 months old (now 7 months). The handle makes it perfect for her to hold and manipulate.   Parents should be aware that although rare, some children have latex allergies.
I found one in a local store - they are very difficult to find, and my son hasn't lost a binkie since! I clip it to his shoulder, and he's able to find it easily. No issues with him rolling over on it, since its always out of the way. Cute, and perfect for keeping binkie close at hand.
my granddaughter is teething.  my daughter-in-law likes jewelry.  this is a perfect match for them.  i bought both the bracelet and the necklace.  biggest problem my granddaughter has is deciding which one to put in her mouth!  the biggest problem i had was deciding which color to get.
My daughter loves MAM pacifiers and I bought these to help her find them in the crib at night. I leave them on the kitchen counter while I make dinner and get her ready for bed (about an hour), and they glow all night long. It's actually pretty impressive, and it does seem to help her!
We tried several different pacis and my son loves this one. I really like the paci holders you can buy separately. I also like how the box it comes in is also used to sterilize them in the microwave. I would buy again. We used these to get my son to stop sucking his fingers. It worked.
It is a nice pacifier because even though she is not quite two months yet she can push it back in her mouth if it starts to fall out and she brings her hand to her mouth. the shape of it and because it is all the same material as the nipple part makes it easier to keep it in her mouth.
My son loves this. He's used it everyday for going on 2 months now. It's the only binky we haven't lost. I wish he would take a different kind of binky as the rubber catches on everything and comes out of his mouth easily, but besides that, the weight and length of this one is perfect.
these contents of these ice packs are non-toxic and do a good job of keeping breastmilk cold. they are pretty good value for the price and have survived daily use for 2 months without issue. i think they are quite durable and will not hesitate to buy again.<br /><br />highly recommend!
My daughters both hated Dummys (Paci's) and never took them. I bought this pack for my 4 month old to chew on which she loves to do but never sucks on them . They are thicker than the 0+ ones that we got from the hospital. I am breastfeeding and these are the closest thing to a nipple.
we use this mirror in my husbands car with good results.  easy to install and adjust.  does need readjustment periodically.  can't really use it in my car, however, because the straps attach around the headrest and my headrest is more of an attached bump rather than a separate headrest.
Bought this for my newborn (2 week old) bc I used this pacifier for my older son when he was new born. I tried the soothie kind coz they say that's more like a nipple but actually my boys both liked the mams.  Just got to hold it in as with any newborn till they grow used to a pacifier.
This is great it hangs right in the strap of baby's diaper bag and fits two pacifiers sono always have one handy. It's also cute I was able to match the color to the diaper bag colors. I love that I don't have to dig for pacifiers or clean them when I find them at the bottom of the bag.
i gave this as a baby shower gift and everyone absolutely loved. right now is handy for the baby for the pacifier and then when the baby gets old can remove the pacifier and they have an awesome toy to play with. the parents loved it  because it makes it easier to find while in the car.
i love how much space this gives my precious baby! all the other playpen s were so expensive and tacky colored. black never goes out of style and this was perfectly priced! now i have a safe place for my little mover while i wash dishes, vacuum, etc! a perfect buy for stay at home moms!
My daughter loves hers!  Sometimes when she's not sucking on the pacifier she just plays with it.  Makes it easy for us to find her pacifier!!  I didn't think it was heavy enough to keep from falling out if she was moving her head a lot, but it was definitely better than the paci alone.
one of my granddaughters theme is ladybugs.  i purchased this night light for use in her nursery.  mom and dad haven't used it yet.  i really like the light.  it is a bit larger than i expected.  if you look at the posted photo, you can see the size as compared to the plate on the plug.
Love these things! I wish I would have known about these for my 1st child! I have used these for my youngest since she was born and she loves them. We havn't lost one and she can easily spot them in any room. I have bought them as baby shower gifts and people always ask when I got them.
i got this for my 2 yr old grandson for when we go out on the boat.  he gets sleepy and there' not a good spot for him to lie down so this really works great.  it's also nice to take when he's on vacation so there's no need to find him a bed or place to sleep.  best of all, he likes it.
this is very comfortable to use. it is so much easier on my back then bending over to try and hold her hands. my niece also enjoys being able to walk around with us. she seems very comfortable (doesn't seem to notice it) and it fits very securely - so we know she is safe. great product.
I have 2 diaper bags, a big one and a small one, so this is perfect for me. I can easily move it from one diaper bag to the other. It easily holds 2 pacifiers and it's made very well. The quality is great and the snap on the handle is very good. I would definitely recommend to everyone!
love the towel and bib...and this vendor was really great about fixing an issue that i had. i ordered the set based on the written description - chicago bears, but received green bay packers. they shipped the correct set to me before i returned the wrong set - fantastic customer service!
My favorite pacifier on the market. It's curved away from baby's face, which means less rash and fewer marks. It's all one piece, so it's easy to clean and you don't have to worry about moisture getting trapped. And frankly, it looks hilarious since it's see-through. These are all I use.
I like it because it cannot get lost as easily as a single pacifier. However I thought it might be a little heavier so baby couldn't spit it out quite so easily. All in all it is good. My baby is only 2.5 months old so he isn't quite holding onto things and realizing what he's doing yet.
i always have one of these bags in my diaper bag at all times and they don't take up much space.  they especially came in handy when we were on a road trip and were about 3 hours away from our destination - with clothes wet from a diaper leak.  these bags also hold up well after washing!
the 7 am le sac igloo is great !!! very warm and easy access. love it so much and my 5 months old loves it too as she is very comfortable in it, we use l.l beans before this and find the 7 am much warmer for my baby. will recommend anyone to get one and try it out to know the experience.
Our son had used the silicon pacifiers previously, until we discovered this natural rubber pacifier. I was nervous that he would reject them because he had been using the other ones for almost a year. He took to them, to my surprise and happiness, without a single problem! We love them!!
My baby loves the wubs! He has 5 and now we're waiting for the sixth to get here today. We have only lost one that he dropped at a large department store. These are awesome because the babies can find them in their crib at night, they don't slip through the slots and they are soooo cute!
have had this installed on my 8 months crib for a few months now, and i can sleep sound at night because of these bumpers. she is such a wild sleeper, but these don't move when she kicks or tries to play with them. great product, they take a little while to get properly installed though.
Our baby likes to suck on this with someone's finger inside. And now that he's teething, he prefers it to other teething tools. A note of caution: we were dog sitting a 1-yr old dog who sought them out to eat them. Our own dogs aren't interested, but the pup sure was. We had to buy more!
this is the same kind the NICU used for my preemie. he hated all the other ones, and it's kinda cool you can see his gums through the hole. my newborn isn't all about the pacifier, but when he needs it, he'll hang onto it. so glad i don't have to go looking all around town to find these.
absolutely love this thing. recommend for any parent having issues with getting newborns to sleep. the only issue is ours has this &#34;creaking&#34; sound when its being rocked back and forth but for all the hours of sleep this thing won my wife and i, i cannot say anything bad about it.
I really like Avent products. The only bad part about this pacifier is that it gets water into the nipple when it's cleaned. After repeated washings all this water turns the inside of the nipple cloudy. I have only used avent pacifiers so I don't know if this is common with all pacifiers.
we have three big dogs and wanted to keep them out of some of the rooms. the entrance to that part of the house is quite wide and we looked at several options, including one ourselves. this has been a very affordable solution, it was very easy to install, and it is easy to open and close.
The giraffe works very well for us,  our baby is a pacifier pusher outter and this giraffe wubbanub when put upsidedown seems to keep it in pretty well in fact better than our other one the mango monkey [[ASIN:B0031W38YO Wubbanub Plush Pacifier Toy, Mango Monkey]]  by being more balanced.
these are the only pacifiers that will stay in my 2 months old mouth for more than 30 seconds! we have the giraffe and the lamb. i wash them on gentle in the washing machine with no problem.  this has literally helped save my sanity. our wubbanub arrived on time in the expected condition.
Easy, out-of-the-box installation.  I found it easy to figure out how to move panels, as well as connect two sets. We are using this to cordon off half of the patio to separate a play area for an infant from the pool. Very nice looking, and solid build. Absolutely a great product. Thanks!
I have used these for 3 years now and love them. Other pacifiers missalligned my children's bite and these have not. I still continue to use them even after the kids are 6 months old b/c they are smaller and mess with their bite less. My only issue is they are hard to find very expensive.
this video baby monitor is awesome. great picture day or night. pretty good range. nice zoom feature and you can move the camera all around. lets you talk to the baby and even play 3 different lullabies. great price for the quality. i would definitely recommend this camera to new parents.
My daughter was given this type of pacifier in the nursery at our hospital. When this package arrived, I thought it would have been bigger. The cat is about the size of a small beanie baby. My daughter likes it - she uses her hands to hold onto the cat's paws. The size is perfect for her.
The only pacifier my baby girl will take! I live on a base overseas and these pacifiers are so hard to come by and sell out quickly where I am. I had to resort to ordering online cause they never have them! Great quality and no plastic pieces! These are the only pacifiers I will ever buy.
i bought the 6-18 month after i heard my baby screaming and had the 0-6 month stuck sideways in his mouth.  i like the design on these also and they are hard to find with out the clear back, which i do not care for at all.  they have been durable and these are the only ones i plan to use.
This product is great. It stays shut, is easy to clean and holds 2 paci's with paci clips. Only complaint is that the loop is open on one side so if it is moved or bumped in just the right way it can come off what every you have it looped too. I would have preferred it was a clip instead.
we got this as a shower gift and i thought it was REEEEALLY creepy. until i saw how quickly my daughter fell asleep when i turned it on. she's nearly 2 now and still loves this bear. once they outgrow the need for the sound, you can take out the sound pack and its just a regular cozy bear.
This is the 2nd Wubbanub we have purchased for our son. They are so cute! This one is by far the cutest. They don't help the pacifier stay put as well as I hoped (I expected it to be a little heavier) but it is easier to grab when he spits it out in the car seat or at night when it's dark.
These are all the babies in my family's preferred pacifier. I love the clear and cut out plastic around the mouth piece. It is still allows you to see how cute there are and doesn't take over the look of their face too much. We have the infant ones and will get the larger size when needed.
We are on Giraffe #2. After a year of heavy use and many washes the original &#34;G&#34; tore away from the paci. This is a great size for even the littlest of hands and my son loves to pull on all of the appendages. We also had a puppy one but my son would always reach for this one first.
love love love must buy! i put a thick clear tape over the speaker to lower the volume (there are no volume controls) - this lasts and lasts and my baby is no longer fussy in bed (the old wind up mobile would stop after a 2 minutes just as she was starting to enjoy it)- this is a great buy
This mattress fits our Graco Pack N Play perfectly, no gaps all around.  This mattress is a huge improvement over the thin,cardboard like mattress pad that come with the pack n play.  I highly recommend purchasing the American Baby Company Organic Interlock Pack N Play sheet to go with it.
i really love this car seat! my daughter was very uncomfortable in her graco 35 maybe because the straps had gotten too tight. but this seat was very easy to install in the rear facing position. it is somewhat hard to loosen the straps at first until you get used to them. very comfy fabric
so far, i love this crib.  i did not experience the smell of paint or any foul odor as some have reported.  the construction is nice and sturdy.  we have not yet had the opportunity to convert it as my daughter is 1 but plan to do so in the future.  it was exactly what we were looking for.
These are the only pacifiers my son likes. The portion that goes in the mouth is shaped differently from traditional pacifiers, but they're nice for kiddos who are teething constantly (it seems like a tooth pops out every week!). There are little bumps at the base to help massage gums, too.
Purchased these when looking for replacements for our Hawaii Medical Gumdrop pacifiers. I ended up preferring these to the Gumdrops, as did my infant. They are just a bit softer and much lighter so they don't tip out of a tiny one's mouth quite so easily when not actively being sucked upon.
baby had not slept in his crib until this monitor arrived.  from the first night, everyone including mommy has slept well, waking only when it's time to eat.  she loved the motion detection pad, which gave her added assurance that anything out of the ordinary would cause the alarm to sound.
These are the same pacifiers that we got from the hospital an the only one that my daughter will take. It also seems to be the best as far a sucking for breast feeding babies. While I don't like giving her a paci so soon, sometimes it is a lifesaver (traffic lights in the car, for example).
These things are so awesome!  Perfect for when you are holding a teething baby.  They are always going for your necklace and trying to chew on it.  While not exactly what you would call fashionable, you don't look a fool wearing them.  They can get down on these with no worries.  Love them!
We love these vanilla scented pacifiers. When my first son was born, he would only take the scented ones. He loved them but so did the dogs. I'm so glad I found them on Amazon now and I don't need to beg the hospital for extras. They are durable, easy to wash and the scent doesn't wear out.
How did parents do it with only pacifiers in the old days?! This is awesome I ended up buying 2 because my son loves it so much. Meow, we named the kitten, is not heavy but just heavy enough that he won't be throwing the pacifier all over for us to chase. He loves it and that makes us happy
This is great! It holds 2 of your daughter's pacifiers and fits great in my diaper bag or if I need to throw it in my purse. It also has a snap on the strap so you can attach it to your bag for easy access. It stays closed well and we have not had issues with it opening unexpectedly at all.
these are much better than microfiber! they are great quality, stuff easily into pocket diapers, wash wonderfully, are easy to rinse out, resist ammonia smells (never have smelled so far), don't leak, are super absorbent and not bulky for 5 layers! we love these inserts! use them every day!
these are really great--  just remember smallest ones are really small (perfect for tiny mouth babies & very new infants) & eventually may need the larger one or baby keeps popping it outta their mouth!  first tried MAM when other pacifiers were too long & gagged baby... these were perfect!
Our son is a little mover and we purchased this changing pad because of the slopped sides and the safety belt. Although the belt and sides cannot stop a super determined crawler, this was very helpful in minimalizing his movement and helping to make changing time more manageable. great buy!
my wife bought this, i bought a different stroller thinking i knew better. my was wrong. my wife was right. this is durable and the most compact as i have seen yet for a double stroller for infants.  click-connect would be nice rather than straps, but not worth trading up in size or weight.
my kids are always spilling something, writing on something or finding other ways to make a mess.  this seat protect is a must have for my family and fit nicely on the back seat of my 2013 vw passat.  this product provides great protection, and is easy to install.  i would highly recommend!
We. Are the decision to avoid pacifiers for our son, but decided that we should have one just in case. These are great. The only time I truly needed to have them in hand was when we were in a 5 hour flight. They kept my son quiet and made for a much more relaxing trip than we had anticipated
i wasn't sure how well i liked the idea of a video monitor and i couldn't be more pleased with this one.  this has made checking in on my little ones much easier and doesn't startle them with the opening of a door or that pesky creaking floorboard.  i would definitely recommend this monitor.
lite-on-shoulder exceeded my expectations.  it's very durable.  i was able to use it for my five-month-old baby and my three-year-old toddler while on vacation.  i use it every day for my now seven-month-old baby.  he loves being in it while carry him around the store, the park, or wherever.
these are the only pacifiers my son will use. my order came promptly and correctly. the only drawback i would mention about this product is that because the pacifiers are rubber they bounce when they hit the ground and debris sticks to the very easily.  amazon service was excellent as usual.
this was so easy to install! the tension rods just snug up to the door frame or wall and stay firmly in place even when we bump in to it. keeps my dogs out of the kitchen wonderfully. i am ordering another for my bedroom door as well (until my new little one stops the need to pee on my bed).
My baby girl refused all pacifiers until this one. I am so happy I bought this. She doesn't care too much for pacifiers anyhow but at least she takes this one every now and then. I highly recommend these to all parents. They seem much more durable than your standard pacifier too. Love these!
The hospital started us on Soothie pacifiers, but they kept falling out of DD's mouth and to the floor. We found Wubbanubs (they use a Soothie paci) and they solved the problem. They stay on her chest and she can even push the paci back into her mouth if it comes out. LOVE!!!  We now have 3.
This arrived super quick, in good condition.  The pacifier is cute, as we ordered another one of these 2.5 years ago for our daughter.  That one has stood the test of time as it is still in one piece! My baby loves it and he is always looking for it.  Babies absolutely adore these pacifiers.
My daughter would only use soothie or gumdrop pacifiers, so the wubbanubs were very helpful.  We have the elephant and the lamb and she loves them both.  She has switched from pacifiers to sucking on her fingers now, but still loves to hold the wubbas.  They are perfect for her little hands.
baby loves it too! this bassinet is sooo nice. love the cover and the see through mesh. our granddaughter<br />cried in the other models without mesh. it's sooo easy to assemble and great for people like us with a house<br />full of pets. mattress thin, but bought a thicker one, works great!
At first I was worried about the fact that they glow and wondering what is in them but we see no signs of any wear and tear on these after months. It's so great to be able to find them without turning on the light. Just hold them up to a light for like 5 sec and they will glow for the night.
We were happy with the new born Chicco Pacifiers, so when our baby grew out of that size we just stuck with the same product. My wife and I love this design and so does our little one. Just like the 0+ Pacifier, the greatest feature of this design is the stationary handle made out of rubber.
LOVE!!! I've had 5 kids...Idk why I didn't think of this....but I'm glad someone did. So far it actually stays in place for me(us). They are adorable but even more so when your baby has it on her little chest. A tiny stuffed cuddly animal for a tiny new person. I'm ordering more for sure! ;)
I bought these because my older children loved the &#34;soothie&#34; pacifiers and these appeared to be the same thing with a cut-out for around the nose. I love that there is only one piece of plastic, which seems safer, and that it comes in lots of colors. We purchased the pink/purple set.
this is the cutest thing I have ever seen, not only does it work but my 9 week old just loves it and can hold it on his chest at night and doe not loose it, when it does finally fall out it stays right next to him so he does not awake because he feels it fall.  just love love love it........
perfect pacifiers, our little man seems to enjoy them and it's easy to spot him (and the paci) in a dark room. Need to &#34;power up&#34; with a bright light before use, not unlike many other glow in the dark products. Can't compare to other paci's as MAM has been ours since he was a newborn
My son loved the initial wubbanub I got for him, the green frog.  I bought three, the dragon, the lion, and the dino.  He loves the myriad of colors.  Very pleased.  It also helps him grasp the object, manipulate the pacifier and aid in transferring from one hand to another, he is 4.5 months.

My son loves his wub and it really helps him keep ahold of his pacifier.  The dino is cute and super soft.  Works well to prevent the pacifier from falling and landing on the floor while he hangs out in his swing.  It is also easier to find in the middle of the night than a detached pacifier.
Excellent. My exclusively breastfed daughter loves these. Mommy loves the purity and safety. I get lots of questions about it and love saying &#34;it's the only one that passed my strict mommy safety standards&#34;. So grateful for these. It doesn't effect her latch at all like some ppl fear.
love how large this is for bigger noses.  this is perfect for my 3 year old when he gets stuffy and needs some help getting his sinuses cleared.  gentle and effective.  it has great suction too.  easily cleaned and assembled/disassembled.  i would buy this again.  the 1 oz size is for babies.
My daughter has 5 &#34;wubbies&#34;  this cow is by far her favorite.  It is so soft, and she loves to play with the ears, especially when she is very tired.<br />Because it is her favorite it has been washed about many times...it washes very well, it always comes clean and it holds up great.
Who doesn't love a WubbaNub?  This combination pacifier and friend has been very popular with my child for his first two years of life.  And now, to try to get him away from the beloved pacifier...this is the goal.  Eventually they do get a bit worn at the seams but that is after LOTS of use!
I love this monkey pacifier!  Great idea!  My son wasn't a big fan of pacifiers.  However, I purchased this as a gift for other friends and their babies loved it.  They also loved it as well because they wouldn't lose it.  Their babies would hold onto the monkey while sucking on the pacifier.
absolutely gorgeous.. using now with my elderly father. i bought one pack, received it, and promptly bought two more. so soft, just what is needed in a vulnerable time, to clean in intimate areas, and for bed bath.  perfect for face cloths as well, i'm going to get some and ideal for babies..
I used this cute and functional item to tie into the ribbons on my new grand daughter's welcome gift. It is well made no sharp edges. She is still too young for a Pacifier, the Pediatrician said 4 weeks old, when she has nursing down pat. Until then it is cute sitting on her chest of drawers.
Bigger than I expected which was a pleasant surprise...super cute...I keep all &#34;wet&#34; items such as my baby butt cream and my hand lotion and chap stick in here...basically anything I don't want to ruin my actual diaper bag if it were to open or leak.  It's adorable and made very well!
bought this chair for a two and a half year old who was sitting unsafely on a barstool and it has been an easy transition.  the chair has not been difficult to clean.  we chose a dark color so that it would not stain.  it is as beautiful of a chair as you would hope it would be for the money.
Didn't want to use pacifier clips with cords so decided to give this little guy a whirl.  LO loves his paci!  He can grip it and makes it much easier for him to find his mouth.  Great quality silicone paci and the giraffe is soft and attached solidly.  Would definitely recommend this product!
My daughter is obsessed with her wubba nub, the elephant in particular. She can't sleep without it. She doesn't even use the paci part, she like to move around with the legs in her mouth. She goes to sleep with the wubba nub in her hand and thumb in her mouth. I had to buy another for back up!
This is really great , it oprotects your pacifier from everything, and could even put it in the sterilizer to clean it. The material is great and looks like very durable, im actually buying a second one. Firdst i did not like the coler but them I realize it was good to see when in a messy room
i've given this as a gift and have one for myself. it lasts for years, versus a cute onesie as a shower gift. the recipient is always amazed at the thoughtfulness and usefulness of the gift. a great, gender-neutral, outside-the-box gift. it's nicely boxed for wrapping too! couldn't be happier.
We LOVE this!!!! Only animal we have found that holds pacifier on 100% of time but pacifier can be removed easily for cleaning, also easy to find when tossed aross car/room by our little one! Highly recommend! We are going to order another one as a back up. Bear gets softer with every washing.
My baby did not want to use any of the pacifiers sold in the stores. I did not intend to use a pacifier before he was born, but it came out that he sleeps so much better with a paci. So I ordered Soothies and my life was saved for about 6 months, until he dismissed these ones too. A MUST-HAVE!
Was given these by labor & delivery when I had my son. Already had some other types at home, but he loves these! Will not take another type. One piece construction and no hard parts. Easy to clean, great for him to teeth on, ordered a bunch and will keep ordering until we ween him off of them.
Because you don't have to buy any refills, thank goodness, and I have a baby trend travel system that is truely awesome, I thought I'd give it a go.   <br />I couldn't be happier...no smells, easy to use and very economical for our tight budget, this pail stands up to it's name...a true champ!
I love this!!!  My son is 3 mo. He loves playing with the giraffe.  It is nice because he can try to put it in his mouth all by himself.  I never lose the pacifer since it is attached, and it has less of a chance to roll and fall on the ground.  I will be buying another one in the near future.
i  needed a drying rack for all the bottles, pacifiers, spoons, etc. my baby has. it works great, fits perfectly on my kitchen counter, spins with no problem. and if you have tall bottles, they fit too!<br /><br />i would buy it as a gift for a friend who's going to have a baby, with no doubt!
This wubbanub is awesome like all wubbanubs, but I like this one because it matches baby girl's wardrobe the most. I feel the safest with these over loose junkies because she fits the whole binky in her mouth and I worry about choking, but with these I feel good enough to leave her sleep with.
We love the wubbanub pacifiers.  When my son falls asleep, I had to search his basinet for the regular pacifiers, but with the wubbanub, it is always on his chest or right beside him.  He's 2 months old now and he's starting to grab it and play with it. So, that kills two birds with one stone.
These little pacifiers are great! They are made of the same material (I believe it's the same brand too) as the Soothies the hospital gives out but they don't cover the whole face. The design makes it look like my baby is smiling and it's adorable. These let my baby breathe and enjoy her paci.
Niece loves it!  She carries it everywhere!  She may be too old for pacifiers soon but she seems to not even bother with the pacifier as much as she enjoys the animal.  It seems as the animal has her security pacifier so she is transferring her security to the animal.  Who knows?  She loves it!
i found this this in a card shop but was to pricey. i went on line to find it and much better pricing ordering on line with amazon. i just thought this was the cutest monkey blanket. my daughters theme is all monkeys and this was a perfect gift! just love it!!!<br />angie from san antonio texas
I tried smoothies, NUK and MAM pacifiers. He keeps MAM in his mouth the longest, for hours. 5 stars<br />I think the reason is because the pacifier is light and the mouth part fits his mouth well.<br /><br />A normal pacifier holder does not work with these so make sure you get the MAM holders.
this is simply a must have for parents who's baby is about to start crawling.  this product also helped my daughter to stand.  she would get lots of practice pulling herself up and standing.  very handy.  product is light, easy to carry, comes put together and folds up into a pretty small size.
I have 5 kids and didn't discover these until my last child.  These are just as discribed.  Life saver at night... no midnight dark searching for the pacifier it is easy to find in the dark:)  Now my daughter is old enough and we don't have to help she finds it all by herself.  Love this thing!
Love the pink color of these 3+ month pacifiers.  I am not sure what the difference is between the 0-3 and 3+ months besides a thicker ring around the part that goes in the mouth.  Otherwise they seem like they are the same size.  Either way, this pacifier is a great product that my baby loves.
We loved the parent's choice Soothie Pacifier, but it was just too big for our baby's face. The nipple on this pacifier is shaped exactly the same, but it's just smaller and stays better in our baby's mouth since it contours to the face. We love this pacifier and are very happy we purchased it.
nice ambient light. very sophisticated. not the brightest night light but i only wanted something with a little glow. plenty to light the bathroom enough so you don't have to turn the lights on at night. also really durable and easy to pack and take with us on vacation. just toss it in your bag.
this chair cover makes my 30 yr old wooden high chair look like new!   fits great, color goes well in my kitchen and my grandaughter dines in style now!    also fits rocking chairs.   since i have two of those from my children, we will get a lot of use out of it over the years!  satisfied grammy
These pacifiers are so cute and my son loves them! They are very durable and easy to clean. My son is also able to hold them easily.  The bright colors make them easy to spot if they happen to fall (or get thrown!) We have used MAM pacifiers for both of our kids and have never been disappointed!
My baby loves these pacifiers, they are the only brand she really took to.  You don't know which colors you will get until they arrive but I have only seen two different color choices in my local stores so any change is good, and she doesn't really need to co-ordinate pacifiers with her outfits.
love this bag; wish i would have had it with my first kid.  top compartment is great for pacifiers; or need to get asap stuff; bag is roomy and has a nice separation.  only problem was the wipes dispenser not staying closed; however a travel size wipes bag fits in there perfect.  problem solved.
Best pacifiers ever.  They're cute, safe, well constructed, gives Jr. something to hold onto (even a baby), and you'll never lose it, when he/she inevitably flings it 20 yards away.  We have the monkey, the duck, the Triceratops, and the Longhorn Bull.  Only needed one, but they're so darn cute!
my daughter has special needs and tends to put her shirt in her mouth when she gets frustrated. this has led to almost every shirt having holes in them. this necklace has provided the stimulation she needs and has become the best replacement for her shirts. we are very pleased with this product.
We have been dealing with the issue of making too much milk, and needed a pacifier for our little one to be able to comfort himself, since he would overeat if he stayed on the breast.  After trying a number of others, this one proved to be the one our son would use.  He just spit out the others.
i used the wrap up until my son learned how to get himself out of it, but it worked its charm in making him sleep when i needed both hands for something. it worked great when travelling also and i didn't want to lug around his stroller. this is one baby accessory you can use over and over again.
This is the cutest thing to keep with my twin girls' carseats and stroller!  The paci is just like the infant Soothie paci from the hospital and the nipple for the Soothie bottles.  My girls love their caterpillar and baby doll (the princess one).  This one has great textures and lots of colors!
What we love about this pacifier is that there is no plastic handle that flops around. We have a few other pacifiers that have the plastic handles and our child does not seem to like the sound or something. These are nice because the handle stays stationary and is easy for the baby to hold onto.
I read many reviews before purchasing this bottle warmer. Many others are reported to heat unevenly, too hot, or too cold. We've had no problems with this one! Of course I do swirl the milk around after it's heated just in case, but I works wonderfully! If you need a bottle warmer, get this one!
This is a very thick mattress and it fits the bottom of my child's Graco Modern Pack 'N Play Playard with Bassinet and Changer, Zurich perfectly. One thing to note: I also purchased a water-proof liner for the mattress but it is not necessary because this mattress is made of water-proof material.
These arrived yesterday and I'm so excited! Our daughter spits her pacifiers out between rooms at night and I find myself frantically searching the dark floor. I set them under a lamp for a few minutes and it was still glowing when I went t check on her hours later. Very happy with this purchase!
i wasn't sure i needed a video monitor, but went ahead and purchased this one anyway.  it might be one of the best baby purchases we made.  i've been using it for about 4 months and it's been fantastic.  good range, good sound and picture quality.  no complaints.  for the price it's a no brainer!
My boy is 9 weeks old. We have been giving him these since he was 2-3 weeks old. He doesn't love any pacifier, but he will at least take these. We also tried the nuk pacifiers, but he won't take those at all. These he at least will self soothe himself with! Will be recommending to all my friends.
just received this yesterday and plugged it in right away. it's very quiet and in some ways the noise it does make is very soothing. i love having a range of settings for how high or low i want it to be. an immediate improvement on our very dry bedroom due to electric heat! definitely a must buy.
this is great to have - finally a place to put all the kids' &#34;babies&#34;! i have been trying to figure out something for years that doesn't take up a lot of room and now i finally found this. however, we have wood walls (not drywall) so i had to buy different hooks/screws to hang it up with.
We have a newborn who absolutely loves these.  He will not use any other pacifier than these.  Anything else goes in, he spits em right out!  Our older daughter was the same way!  Quality made, durable and worth the money.  If you're looking for baby pacifiers, these are the ones you need to get!
this item was a birthday gift to my granddaughter. i'm told that she enjoys playing with her baby stroller. the baby stroller is sturdy and well constructed. i did order this item at the last minute but because i have amazon prime the package arrived in time for my granddaughter's birthday party.
We tried 4 or 5 different pacifiers (something I recommend), and this shape was the one our baby preferred. It's a bit pricier than other pacifiers, and our baby seems to like the NUK classic as well, so that is another option.    It's a bit tricky to clean and dry, as it gets water into the tip.
This is one of the pacifiers we got in the hospital with my first son after buying all Dr. Browns pacifiers. He would not take anything else except for Nuks... We couldn't find them in store except on Amazon... The same exact thing happened with my second son, we will never buy a different brand!
I breastfed my daughter exclusively for the first 6 months. We introduced this pacifier at 2 months and she loved it right away. It was the only style that she would use. She is now 7 months and no longer takes a pacifier, but she still likes to chew on these. So they make great teethers as well!
Our son loves this thing! It really has helped him grab on and hold things better and quicker. He is able to actually play with it and get it back in his mouth at 3 months old. Esp like the monkey. It is super soft and washes nicely. We have the elephant too, but do not prefer the material on it.
This is one of my favorite purchases for my newborn son! The shape and size of the dino are perfect to rest on his chest and hold the pacifier where it needs to be so my son can reach it! He also likes to hold onto the dinos body. I am thrilled with this wubbanub and would recommend it to anyone!
My baby would only take the Soothie pacifier, which was tough bc it would fall out every 3 seconds. This had been a godsend bc he loves it just as much and the shape is so much more conducive to his face. If only I could find it in a store but at least w my Prime account it's the next best thing!
this addition is awesome.  it makes the joovy stroller for two into a real two seater.  my 4 year old son absolutely loves that he can now recline like his sister!  great product!    i forgot to add that installation is also super easy.  its just a bunch of clicks with snaps and you have the seat!
I got this for a new mom to be as a baby shower gift. It is super cute and everyone loved it..including the new mom to be! She can't wait to use it. It is a wonderful invention and I wish I had it for my kids! I can't wait to see it in action with my friend's baby. It's a perfect baby shower gift.
If you're baby will take a mam pacifier, these are a must have!!!! It makes it super easy to find and replace the pacifier without turning any lights on when the baby spits it half way across the room in the middle of night! Attach a &#34;blanket&#34; or a stuff animal to anchor it, you're golden.
I received this blanket as a gift from my mom and have never felt anything so soft.  My daughter, age 5 months has had this since she was born and loves it.  Oh yeah, and the cat keeps fighting with me to claim it as her own.  My only complaint is that I can't find an adult version of the blanket.
i love this monitor! my husband and i did a lot of research before finally deciding on this monitor. it was exactly what we were looking for. i was planning on having to spend a lot more on monitor, but this one works great for the low price. definitely will recommend it to my friends having kids.
Love these. They are the only binkey my 9 month old will take (she still prefers the 0-3 month ones instead of the 3+ which are harder). They are great at night because we just throw a bunch of them in her crib so she can find one if she wakes up, but they don't hurt her if she rolls over on them.
Soo cute! As others have posted I'm sure it will be a pain to keep clean but I knew that when we bought it...had to get it for the dragon. Haven't used it yet because we're still waiting on our son to come home from nicu but I'm sure he'll love it cause it the same pacifier that the hospital uses.
I purchased this bear for a friend whose granddaughter had a baby who was not sleeping. The sound of this bear sounds very much like the womb sound. The bear is very well made and a nice size. The baby isn't sleeping much better but this doesn't mean that another baby would react much differently.
this was such a handy tool for feeding my baby. in fact, it was the only way she would allow me to feed her. i figured that the steady flow of food was just her preference since she has had a very hearty appetite since she came into the world. it was quick and simple and the cleaning was a breeze.
I thought these were relatively expensive for a pacifier but I heard good things from other moms so I decided to buy one. My son loves these! They are softer and almost flatter then the regular nuks. They do get water trapped in it if you boil it but it just takes a squeeze to get out. I reccomend
i really liked these. i was skeptical at first because, when i first pulled them out of the package, they were almost as thin as bed sheets. after about 5 washes they quilted nicely. i would recommend them to anyone! and i am a first time mom, first time cloth diapering, first time using prefolds.
these seem to be the favorite shape for my baby. She is 3.5 months and has begun teething very early. She seems to still like these the best because they can be chewed a bit and seem to bring her some extra comfort. Sometimes I even chew on the rim myself and get a bit of satisfaction out of it :)
i bought this when it was time to take a road trip with my 6 month old. i had been using a small handheld in the car for other times we were out & needed to pump but for long trips only my symphony would cut it. love this. felt 100% the same power you get from plugging into wall. can't live without
i love these bottles! after trying all these fancy, nice bottles that have all these special features, but my son easily latched on to these bottles.  they're easy to clean, they're the perfect flow, they're great for travel because they have additional cap under the nipple.  they're awesome!!!!!!!
this product is great! when we were first looking the one that matched our stroller was 50$ considering we had already spend $450 we didn't want to spend another 50. i saw this and with the adjustable straps and knew it would work. my husband and i also jog and nothing moves in it. awesome product.
this skip hop whale easily adjust to fit snug on my tub water spout. its soft to the touch and easy to remove and clean. my boys al love the whale. it protects their heads from potentionally a hot metal spout, from hitting their heads on the hard spout, and from other dangers. i have no complaints!
Our 6 month old loves her paci. WubbaNub is the only one this child will take! It is super easy for her to find at night when it is dark. It is the only one she will fall asleep with. I have tried many different kinds including the Smoothie by it's self and she wants nothing to do with any of them!
Babies need to suck to soothe themselves. The hospital gave us one of these and told us pacifiers also can prevent SIDS. Our baby loves this pacifier and we have given it to him since day one. I am breastfeeding and he has not had any nipple confusion. Make sure you have enough before you get home!
I absolutely adore this company鈥?. Two of my cousins just had babies and I bought them both this product鈥? They loved them. Nicely done鈥?perfect shower gift. Shipping with amazon prime was super fast and everything was packaged well.  VERY VERY NICE PRODUCT!!!!! And ever so cute!!! ~~~ caitie xoxox
absolutely love this diapers bag! i was looking for diaper bag forever until i found this one. i can hold 6 bottles,makeup bag,wallet, 10 formula packages,changing pad with 10 diapers and the travel container full of wet wipes and lots of other stuff, with plenty of room left over highly recommend.
These are the only pacies she likes. What I like is that they are fully silicone (or whatever that is), so there are no parts that can break off and become a choking hazard. I also like that they are softer than the pacifiers with the plastic base, which can be abrasive to a baby's sensitive mouth.
we bought this to keep a distance between our two-year-old and the christmas tree.  we anchored it with furniture on both ends and it has served its purpose well.  she can push on it but not enough to be a problem.  i'm thinking of using it on the deck later and we can see all kinds of uses for it.
this robe is adorable. it is soft and perfect for when my little ones get out of the bath. they love to be warm right after the bath, so this robe is great. and he looks like a little ferocious lion. it's great! the material is really soft, doesn't get all matted from being wet, and really durable.
great price for a great chair. nice and light but sturdy. easy to clean. my daughter is 8 months old and loves to sit in it and eat her finger foods in the kitchen while i cook. she's small for her age and the seat fits her much better than her high chair. highly recommend for travel and home user.
I wish I knew about these with my first child! These are great!! No more pacifiers falling under tables or the couch. My son can find it, grab it and put it in his mouth all on his own. Also more of a comfort than just a regular pacifier since he can hold it. Love all the animal options. We have 2!

My daughter has loved these Soothies since birth and having colors other than the ubiquitous green is a godsend for daycare so she doesn't end up with another baby's pacifier. We probably have 20 of these stashed throughout our house and in our cars to be sure we're never caught without one nearby.
it might seem silly to spend money on baby spoons, but these are absolutely worth it. they are easy to use, easy to clean, colorful, and safe. furthermore, there customer service is absolutely top notch with prompt email responses and follow through. best spoons with best service, whats not to like!
These pacifiers glow in the dark which is so helpful when your baby wakes up crying because she lost her pacifier. They are great quality and they are designed and developed by pediatric dentists and orthodontists. I feel comfortable letting my infant suck on them and they really seem to soothe her.
Wubbanub is the best pacifier product on the market.  The Elle Bella Elephant is so cute.  My daughter lost her first wubbanub and I had a hard time finding a cute girly one to replace it in local stores.  I settled for a duck until I could find a better one and this was just what I was looking for.
this item was larger than it appeared in the pictures so it was added value in my mind. it can be hung on a mobile or just placed on baby's tummy or lap because it's easy to grab and investigate. the colors and textures are a big attraction and give visual stimulation as well as sensory stimulation.
i bought these after i saw the great reviews and i have to say these are really great. it requires a little patience with a newborn, especially because i cut my baby's nails in her sleep and don't want to wake her. they are very sharp so you have to be careful, but they effectively remove the nails.
This little cow is so soft and floppy. Perfect for your newborn. My grandson has a few of the different designs but this one I ordered for a shower gift and was so pleased with it when it came. The underbelly part is a flowered soft cotton waffled material that you find in recieving blankets. Sweet.
Love these Bink's! I really like that the handle lies flat so my daughter doesn't plat with it when I lay her down to sleep. This bundle is cheaper than buying a two pack at our grocery store. She only uses them for sleep but I think they look nicer in her mouth like they fit around the nose better.
from birth until 2 months she didn't really like soothies,, but at 3 months she liked it! now at 4 she loves it!! only thing is it distracts her and she pulls it to play with it and no more use as paci lol...<br /><br />also she crosses her eyes to look at it which I don't like but she def, loves it
Had the newborn one and now bought these since he's 4 months old. Baby loves loves it, he calms down right away. He doesn't get nipple confusion either. I can take it away and breastfeed him right afterwards. I so suggest to wait atleast month after baby is born if you want to avoid nipple confusion
this comes in handy quite often.  the colors are bright, the material is durable and best of all, it folds up into a small carrying case that you can throw just about anywhere.  (we keep ours in the trunk of our car but it barely takes up space in the base of the stroller if we take it for picnics).
While there is no detectable difference between the 0-3 month pacifier by Avent and their 0-6 month pacifier, the 6-18 month pacifier is noticably larger.  I made the switch from 0-6 to 6-18 at 10 months and neither of my twins seems to notice a difference.  It was time for fresh pacifiers anyhow...
these bottles are awesome. we've tried several different brands and these are the only ones my twins seemed to really like. the big size is definitely a plus, they eat more than what our smaller medela bottles can hold now. we had to buy slow flow nipples however because the mediums made them choke.
Our 6 month old MUST have dragon to fall asleep - he's a savior! Plus, unlike a regular pacifier, he's easy to keep a hand on so he won't fall on the floor. And we sometimes tether him, too. The only problem is that the dogs have destroyed two of them. so if you have dogs, get a couple extra Dragons.
These are the same model we got from the hospital.  The clips don't work on these, but my daughter liked this model the best.  These are also available in an older size.  The older one is a bit stiffer, so I'd consider those as you will get more time out of the product.  Same company and same colors.
these are good bottle labels. they are easy to write on with different types of pens, and peel off easily without leaving any sticky residue behind. i bough enough to hopefully last through two babies. i received some as a shower gift, and when i went to purchase more, could only find them on amazon.
Soothies are the only kind of pacifier that my daughter will take. Wubbanubs are not only cute, but the animal provided actually gave her something to hold onto when she got big enough, and when i would lay it on her chest she could sleep without the pacifier falling out and rolling away. Love these!
This is the only paci my baby will use!! I love how soft they are, they don't get lost as easy, and my son can hold on to the animal. It was hard to pick which animal because they're all so cute, but we got both monkeys and couldn't be happier. Bought one for my daughters teacher whose expecting too.
this is a wonderfully soft and warm receiving blanket.  my favorite thing about it is the size.  it is much larger than the other receiving blankets i've used.  it is easier to wrap the baby up snuggly and he stays wrapped up.  we've used swaddle designs for both of our kids, i highly recommend them!
my daughter was fascinated with the contents of the cabinets doors of my desk.  these are perfect at keeping her out and didn't require me drilling into the wood.  the adhesive is very strong and i haven't had any problem with these tearing out.  i imagine these would work great for other things too!
I bought this for my 1 year old's nap time at daycare.  I like the padded mat part since they have hard floors.  I've washed it at least three times and have noticed the fleece pilling but overall for the price and what he uses it for, I think I'd buy it again.  My little guy loves the tractor theme:)
We got a few different types/brands and these have been our son's favorite pacifiers by far.  He seems to keep this one in better than others.  The one-piece silicone design is great.  It's super easy to clean, and the silicone shield seems like it would be more comfortable than a hard plastic shield.
My newborn baby loved these! And I loved them since they are super easy to wash. My baby has now moved onto the Avent paci's and with the Avents, water can sometimes get trapped in the nipples whereas, these do not.  These are sold as a 2 pack at Target for around $5 so this is definitely a great buy!
had no problems with installation.  perhaps 20 mins.  software is as advertised. no bells and whistles, just a monitor for ios that works.  going to get a 2nd one.<br /><br />bought a 2nd one.  again no problems whatsoever. i can toggle between the cameras with the software by two finger swiping.  ez.
A friend let us try out one of these pacifiers after we stocked up on the &#34;soothies,&#34; which he refused to use.  He likes these and still uses the same style at 1 year (we didn't buy the older type).  He only uses them for sleep.  The glow-in-the-dark feature is nice but doesn't last the night.
i love this monitor! i bought it when my daughter was almost 2 when my monitor broke. i only wish i had it when she was a baby! the picture quality is excellent and the sound quality is also excellent! there is absolutely no interference, no static what-so-ever.   i highly recommend this baby monitor.
The adorable animal keeps the paci in my baby's mouth until she can put it there herself.  The paci part is just like the ones they had at the hospital so baby had no problem transitioning.  She also likes chewing on the soft animal part.  We had no problem throwing them in the washing machine either.
This is adorable and helps stay put better with brand new baby.  Better to start it right away and very interesting to note this is the type pacifier being given at the hospital to new babies now! All shapes and styles were available on Amazon.  Good shopping place and received in just couple of days!
We went through so many others before our DS would finally take these.  He didn't like them over his face...these have a convex shape and he loves them.  If you have a PITA child who is super fussy and picky...give these inexpensive pacifiers a try!  Once we found these, he has been a different child!
My son and daughter-in-law love pirate things.  They decorated the room for the baby boy they were expecting in a pirate theme and we had a pirate baby shower for her (Ahoy, It's a Boy).  I bought this pacifier as one of the many things to fill the whale baby bath tub.  It was a big hit at the shower!
I have twins and bought one for each girl. They are wonderful and my babies love them. They will defiantly be gifts for all my friends who are expecting. They work great when the babies are swaddled at night and great to find if they are dropped in their car seats. They also hold them in their swings.
this diaper is great for night time. it is a little bit bulky in the front with both inserts in but at night it's a must. my son made it all the way through the night without a diaper change! he is 5 months old and about 15 lbs. tall and skinny and the fit was great. i am definitely going to buy more!
My daughter loves these! They are great at night when she can't find her binkie and starts crying. They are cute well made and parent friendly. The age limit is 0-6 months. She is 6 months now and has really started liking it. I have no plans to take it away from her unless it becomes a choking issue.
these are a must have for anyone with babies!  we used them for both kids and have purchased them for shower gifts. they aren't the cutest gifts but super functional!  we use them also in our diaper bags since they are lighter and less bulky to carry than the changing pad that came with the diaper bag.
This item is cute, perfect for one or two pacifiers only. Its good to keep a spare pacifier just in case the one in your baby's mouth falls out and gets dirty. It's an accessorie, looks cute and stylish. Not really needed but useful ...Just in case.<br /><br />Keep in mind this only fits two pacifiers.
This is the only paci my breastfed daughter wants. We LOVE it. Well worth the money. It fits very snug to her face like my breast does while nursing. It also seems to stay in her mouth with less work than any silicone pacifier ever did. Great product. We will definitely buy another when this wears out.
i have the grey and sangria wraps. i love both, but the grey is a bit more versatile. at first i had a lot of difficulty wrapping when my baby was a newborn, but after about a week i got the hang of it (after watching some good youtube videos) and love it. it's so simple and adjusts as your baby grows.
Although we had another pacimal, it was getting worn out.  My son took to the first one easily and he absolutely loves this one.  It is a great product because it is a two in one product.  You have the paci and the toy,  we never leave home without it.  I would recommend this to every parent out there.
This is the only pacifier that my son will take.  He was in the NICU for 23 days and this is the pacifier that the hospital used.  They also make bottles with the exact same nipple as the soothie.  I don't use them (I use Dr. Brown's), but if you have a picky nippler it might be something to look into.
we don't have a baby but use the flushable whips in our bathroom.  they usually come in a flimsy containers that makes them dry up before all are used. saw this and thought perfect....and it is. sturdy, easy to pull out one at a time, even without holding the box, and the whips stay moist till the end.
My daughter loves her WubbaNub. It's the perfect size for her tiny (4 mo) hands and it's soft enough for baby cuddles. The paci on the end is great. My only concern would be how to clean it properly, but paci wipes work well for now. I'm sure the body is washable I just haven't needed to find out (yet)
i may have been able to purchase a seat that was a bit cheaper, but the convenience of the click tight and knowing britax's reputation for safety, i feel that my baby is safe and comfortable and that means a lot. you can feel that there is extra padding in the seat for that added comfort. we love it!!!
love these things!  they are made out of the same material as the wonderful bumkins bibs, washable, reusable, and cute! i have hand washed them and machine washed them, they have held up very well and hold a lot of food!  much nicer than a ziploc - and easier for little hands to use a zipper like this!
washable, and cute - much nicer to use than a ziploc.  the zipper is easy for my little one to use, too.  washed by hand and in the washing machine - they hold up great.  these are made out of the same material as the wonderful bumkins bibs.  hold a perfect amount of goldfish for a day out on the town!
Some hospitals have gone 180 against formula and pacifiers. This is what 2 years ago the hospital gave us after your daughter was born and it was a God send to soothe her. I am all for breast feeding, but the baby does not need to be on your nipple all the time. Give the a break and give the baby this!
My baby uses munchkin latch bottles, and these are his favorite pacifiers.  I gave him many options, but he chose to match bottle to paci.  Also, just and FYI ... I breastfeed and don't have problems switching back and forth.  I'm not sure if that is kid dependant or has something to do with the brand.
i loved my monitor so much that i had to buy another one for the new baby! such a great picture, a great lasting battery, and everything about it is easy to use. i've had my first one for 2 years and have never had an issue with it, so i kow this is a product that can last through a lot of hours of use.
My little 2 month old likes to eat so much she will overeat and vomit. Now I give this to her when I think she has eaten enough.  She actually hugs it to her, pulls its ears, and has stopped eating too much.  If she is full, her elephant soothes her, and if not, she pulls it out and cries for more food!
this little bear was just the right size for a 2-year-old!  and it is just the softest, most cuddly little bear ever!  gund makes amazing stuffed animals.  i remembered from when my kids were little.  the best stuffed toys were gund.  this was a birthday present for my granddaughter.  she just loves it!
Not a day passes without needing these!<br />They're hollow and see through. Looking through the cavity while the baby is chewing on them is mesmerising 0_0 hehe<br />Plus, if you look at them while the nipple is facing you directly, you'll notice that they're shaped to look like a smiling pinocchio :o)
We have 3 different ones, and I want more! They are so easy for my child to find at night an pop in his mouth. Not to mention adorable! One day I saw him put the entire (no wubbabnub attached) binky in his mouth! yikes! so I will not ever give him a non wubbanub binky again! They are safer and too cute!
easy to use for formula or snacks. i iike these better then the ones you find in most baby stores because the components are not connected and therefore cannot mix. also very convenient that the opening fits right into a regular bottle so you can shake the pre-measured formula right in without any mess.
My son has never been a big fan of pacifiers, but he likes these!<br /><br />Seriously good stuff. I bought 4 to have on both floors, in the car and a spare.<br />It looks off putting while sterilizing, but goes back to normal.<br />And of course it's all natural.<br />We always get compliments on it :)
Perfect for our preemie! The little bit of weight of the monkey helped him keep the pacifier in when he couldn't do it on his own, and gave him something to cuddle as he drifted off...made transitioning him from breastfeeding to pacifier easy too as he had something to hold after he snuggled with mommy.
As a very young infant I would say helpful but could live wo.  As our daughter became 2 months old we seriously could not make it a day wo.  The pattern is interesting for development.  The stuffed animal makes so you don't have to put their pacifier back in 60 times.  They will just hold on themselves.
My son will only take this pacifier! Lol I lost the first one and had to buy the exact one ASAP! I also love the fact that he can find it easily at night. He grabs it and places it right in his mouth. He's not able to do that with a regular pacifier. This pacifier is a bit pricy but worth it at the end.
love all the britax brand car seats鈥?easy to use, dependable, durable. my son is two and been a beating, but when he's older, we will buy the britax booster, and when the new baby is due, we will buy another infant car seat from britax. we drive in a busy seat breaking hard, swerving and he just sleeps!
this has been the only babyproofing cover that my son has not been able to figure out at the ripe ol' age of 2 1/2. my covers get a lot of wear and tear on them, so i had to purchase an additional set when one broke. i also love that i am able to throw them in the dishwasher if they happen to get dirty.
the smell is wonderful coming right at you through the plastic it comes it.<br />it is big and you can't miss it, company with be amazed at how big of dog and smell.<br />it came with the cd's i ordered and i loved that, no reason to send things in different packaging<br />unless if course very fragile.
fits perfectly over my chicco cortina travel system stroller. its a great fit with or without the car seat. its made of a heavy, durable feeling plastic. glad i purchased this one.<br />only complaint is that it's hard to fold up and fit back in the bag but i just fold it up and take it along. it's fine.
Our 6 month old LOVES this pacifier. It is easy for him to hold and get back in his mouth. It is easy for me to hold onto it when we are out and about, too, so it doesn't fall on the floor. The plush is soft and nice. I wash mine in the washing machine inside a lingerie bag. These make a wonderful gift!!
My daughters soothie passy's go flying in a parking lot when dropped. I've lost several in her 4 short months.<br />This product helps immensely.<br />We use this when traveling in her car seat. I originally thought it was just the stuffed animal but, was pleased to find that the pacifier comes attached.
we have a colicly baby and she cries all the time. this helps her quiet down and i can get some things done at the same time. i am a guy so the stars are a little girly says my wife but i really don't care. i wanted one that wasn't dark in color as i wanted it to be cooler in summer weather for the baby.
Even when it comes to newborns.<br />Especially when it comes to newborns.<br /><br />When it hits the floor, most of us wash it carefully, and sometimes you just don't have the spare 2 minutes.<br />These pacifiers are shaped for safe, soothing comfort. The sanitary covers are a big plus when traveling.
Baby loves his WubbaNub. Apparently it is totally different from knock-off or competing brands, so don't bother trying to save a couple bucks by buying something called, for example, &#34;cozee-coo&#34;.  It really must be the genuine WubbaNub article. The magic is invisible to me, but baby is convinced.
We have a couple of these and our daughter loves them! We actually snipped the pacifier point off of one so she couldn't suck on it but could still hold the little animal for comfort. It has also improved her hand eye coordination because she has to hold on to the animal to get the pacifier in her mouth.
love these bibs!  the colors and patterns are great, and i love that there are two snaps, so they will continue to fit as my boy grows.  the backing is super soft, too!  i also like the longer, narrower look as opposed to the short, wide ones. just more fashionable i think. great for babies of all ages!!
much better value over the 3.5 inch screen.  you will never say, &#34;i wish i had a larger image and less battery life.&#34;  we don't keep it on all the time.  on, check, off.  the batteries last for weeks if you do this.  i recommend the 2 camera pack instead.  i wish they had that when i bought this.
my daughter loves this thing. she carries it around by the handle and enjoys her snacks all over the place--in the car, in the stroller, in the grocery store, etc. the only snacks i have to pick up are the ones she drops from her hand, not the ones she dumps out of the cup because those don't exist--yay!
These are the only type of pacifiers my daughter would take. I love that they glow in the dark, great for when they fall out at night! Unless you put them right under a light, they glow but not too bright. I put one under a light for awhile and my daughter couldn't sleep because it was glowing to bright.
Love this product. I purchased this product for my daughter's new baby. It helps to protect the nuke from germs. I love the colors and satisfaction we get in knowing that air born germs are not spreaded on our baby's pacifier. Light weight and different. Highly recommend this item to new moms and seller.
These feel absolutely amazing and are very soft. Well worth the money and super cute too. It wasn't as sparkleally as expected,but thay doesn't matter too much when they do the trick and calming down my little bratty baby. :) thumbs up. Would buy again. I expect nothing less than perfect from the germans.
highly recommend!! love it!  i loved this tub! it was so much easier than filling the bathtub up with water and it worked perfect until she was 2. another thing that i loved - we all know kids tend to poop in the bath - this is a lot easier to dump and refill than draining the bathtub too! great product!!
i recieved two as a gift at my shower for my second son and was hesitant because my first rejected EVERY binky sold at BRU. but this time around it works like a charm, its the only one he takes so i have 5 in storage in case we lose one. it doesnt leave marks on his face and fits 'just right' in his mouth
this scarf is amazingly lightweight, great coverage, and the loop helps prevent it from slipping off while you feed.  i haven't worn it as a scarf, but it folds up really small for easy storage in his diaper bag.  washes really easily.<br /><br />i'm 5'11 and when wearing this it falls just below my hips.
We love this paci tether!  As with all toys, parents should watch for degradation of materials.  We use this as a tether, not a 'teething' toy.  When I see a crack, I remove the bead, removing just 1 or two beads does not render this tether useless.  I've only lost 1 bead on each of the tethers I own (2).
this was the best purchase for the money....$58 and it is sturdy, colorful, spacious, easy to clean, bright and very cheery....my great grandson, mackson, enjoys it thoroughly when visiting great grammy.....don't hesitate if you are thinking of buying a playard...36&#34;x36&#34;...lots of room to play in.
Like that this one could be used w/ the soothies brand pacifiers. Not using it too much yet, because don't want anything clipped on my infant, as it kinda gets in the way now, but will certainly use down the road and attaching in carseat/stroller.  Just wish I knew what design I was getting ahead of time.
this made a huge difference in the phoenix weather. we used to carry water bottles around just to try to cool off the metal part of the seat belts because they would literally burn our children's legs. since using these, the metal stays slightly warm instead of scalding hot. highly recommend this product.
it is so easy to just throw whatever is messy into this hamper.  it looks great and i like the fact that the lid hides whats in there until its ready to be washed.  the lid also pushes down or folds out to make it easy to get stuff in the hamper.  plus its light weight and easy to carry even when its full
i love these! we do blw and they are perfect for my 7 month old to start with self feeding. i give applesauce on the blue one and yogurt on the orange one. they work so much better for begginers than regular spoons. i have actually purchased two sets. they do discolor slightly, but that is not a big deal.
This elephant so cute. We get comments and questions about it at least once a week. It also works as expected - it stays it a lot longer than other pacifiers. It is not as heavy as I expected but I am very pleased with it. Who knew my daughter would look so adorable with an elephant gaming from her mouth!
These are my son's favorite brand. Love the &#34;Air&#34; style where he doesn't have a ton of drool or moisture pressed against his face. Plus, you can see him smile through it. Great product.<br /><br />Comes with a sanitizing case so you add a little water, microwave it, they're completely disinfected.
...what more can you say?  This pacifier is both functional and hilarious.  Sometimes my infant would play with this on her own and when we would look over and she would randomly have it in her mouth.  She could never figure out why we were laughing at her and grabbing for the camera.  SO worth the price!
My son LOVES this. He has three of these in different animals. They make it turbo easy for him to put his own nuk back in his mouth. They are hands down his favorite, go to toys. He has liked them since birth, but has grown more and more fond of them and at 7 months, adores them. I highly recommend these.
I use these interchangeably with the Soothie. Only small difference is that baby gets these turned sideways when he sleeps and can't keep it in his mouth that way sometimes. So we use soothie in the crib (they are difficult to find a pacifier clip for anyway), and Gum drop around the house and for travel.
I bought this as a baby gift after seeing my nephew using his. Hope this helps my friend never loose a pacifier again. The only thing I'm not crazy about is the pacifier is stuck there. It can't be removed. It would be nice to be able to change the pacifier. Other than that it looks like a great baby gift.
This is our third Haba binky (pacifier) chain.  It is one of the only chains we could find to hold the binky given to us by the hospital.  The clip is a necessity to keep the binky off the floor and attached to us, the child, or the stroller/baby carrier.  We would absolutely recommend this pacifier chain.
Our baby got her teeth early so these are her constant companions. The pacifier are a good size, wash well, have a top that helps with drainage after washing, and most importantly, stand up to the constant use our daughter gives them.<br />We have several of these pacifiers and they are worth every penny !
i was a bit skeptical when purchasing this crib skirt but i'm very glad i ordered it and made my own decision. the skirt is well sewn together and fits my crib perfectly. the fabric is pretty decent quality and does a great job of adding character to our baby's crib. so glad i ordered this finishing touch!
After trying all kinds, these are the only pacifiers that my daughter will take.  I love them and they come in such cute colors!  So glad we found these!<br /><br />The glow-in-the-dark kind are especially genius... no more searching for lost pluggies with a flashlight trying not to wake the baby too much.
if you need a spare pack & play for a family member (i bought two of these for our mothers homes) or if you have a two story home (keep one upstairs and downstairs) this is the perfect size and price. as easy as the larger versions this smaller footprint would be great for a smaller home too.<br />love it!
i'm very happy with this organizer. it is a perfect size and looks exactly like it is pictured.  very well made.  the only thing that surprised me since i am used to very fast shipping and deliveries with amazon prime, is that it took about 3 weeks to receive.  but the chinese return address explains that.
I had purchased one of these for each of my previous children so i thought i would buy one for my newest addition. Once again i was not disappointed. My son loves it and it goes everywhere with us. It has helped my son sleep in his crib over night, it gives him something to cuddle with. In short I love it!
My son, who is breastfed, was comfort nursing on me every half an hour so at 3 weeks we introduced a pacifier. We bought dr browns, soothies, wubbies, and these. These are the only ones he really likes. We can sometimes get him to take a soothie after a very long struggle. Will be purchasing more of these.
These are just such a great invention!<br /><br />The materials is so soft and it's a nice color.<br />Baby likes to hold it and &#34;pet&#34; it - it seems to relax her.  She's teething and will sometimes gnaw on the feet or ears of the elephant - it's held up very well to this.<br /><br />Would recommend
They came wrapped individual packages, like from the hospital. (Sanitized)  Maybe that is why they are more expensive then what you can find at the store... but all the stores were out of them. These pacifiers are a staple at our house, the only ones he will use. It is good to replace every 3 months too...
I love this product!! I would love for the pacifier to have a cap... but other than that is great!! My little girl started using it around 2.5-3 months, before that she couldnt hold the horse, but now she loves it and grabs it without a problem!! It makes it easier for her to put it back when it falls too!
My baby loves these! They have no cracks for dirt/germs to live in and they are super soft. She even likes to chew on the other side to soothe her gums from teething. I love that there is no BPA or BPS in them. A lot of BPA free pacifiers still contain BPS - which is JUST AS SCARY! Love the natural rubber!
I can't wait to start using these. Though to be honest they smell super weird. I hope I get used to it... it's really overpowering though Every now and then I think I smell them and they're not even in the room anymore... lol oh well as long as the baby looks cute sucking on them I think I can get over it.
These are a little blessing while having a newborn!  Our daughter takes these very well.  They don't sit against their little faces, so moisture doesn't get trapped.  Sad these are only for 0-3 months since our daughter turns 3 months tomorrow.  Hopefully the next step up Avent pacifiers work just as well.
I was sick of fumbling around in the middle of the night for my daughter's paci.  This solved the problem.  Even if they hadn't been in any light, they were still visible hours after I put her to bed.  They also helped her learn to put her own paci back in.  I would highly recommend getting a few of these!
We love the brand and we love the price! Reputable brand. My advise is change regularly.<br /><br />We also got the night ones, glow in the dark:<br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001L2SA3A?ie=UTF8&camp=213733&creative=393177&creativeASIN=B001L2SA3A&linkCode=shr&tag=nealo10a-20&linkId=GF7RSUBA6H7S4S25
Cute and my daughter loves them.  Wash well (in a toy sack in washer) and hold up well. When it was time to wean my older two daughters from the pacifier, we simply cut the paci off and they still had the animal as a lovie to make the transition easier. We plan on doing the same for baby girl number three.
we took this stroller on vacation to yosemite and san francisco.  it's a very basic stroller but the kids seem comfortable and i like the 5-point harness.  our stroller made the trek down some tough trails and performed beautifully.  it's a great value and i would definitely recommend this to someone else.
this was easy to assemble and install on the bed.  also stores well for later use.  liked that it has mesh to make it less claustrophobic.  grandson has no objection to using it for his sleepovers.  he doesn't flip is down and instead exits the bed from the end.  he rolls around a lot and it kept him safe.
Our son loves this pacifier and is the only one he takes at night. We had tried several other ones prior to this one, and this is the only one he could keep in his mouth for more than a few minutes. Also, he was able to put it back in his mouth quicker than with other ones due to the nice big handle on it.
Our LO loves these pacifiers.  The nipple is bigger than some pacifiers, and he seems to prefer them for that reason.  I also love the sanitizing case they come in.  You simply put a little bit of water in the case, put it in the microwave for a few minutes, and they come out sparkling clean and germ-free.
this is amazing! it's really light weight and easy to hold for my four month old! i had to show her how to rub the little rubber bristles on her gums and it was all over from there. we have to fight her to get it back when it's time to eat or go to bed! she uses it as a teether and won't take anything else.
Our son is exclusively breastfed and I was concerned about giving him a pacifier. We waiter a few weeks after birth and tried the Soothie. He took to it immediately and now uses it to fall asleep for naps.<br /><br />Since buying it, I've tried introducing other pacifiers. Nope, no go. Only Soothie will do.
My grandchildren absolutely adore their Wubbanubs.  They give the child tactile comfort, as each one is very soft and plush.  Also it gives the child something to hold onto as they utilize it.  I'd recommend all varieties of this product.  This one is a gift for Easter, but, another favorite is the giraffe.
i highly recommend summer infant swaddles. they are the best. i've tried other brands and they just fall off, or don't fit right etc. i've never had any issues with these. also, my daughter preferred to have her hands out when she turned about a month old, and these still work great either way you use them.
Both my kids use this binky and now it has been discontinued.  They changed the whole style and shape of the &#34;binky&#34; brand, and it is nowhere near the same.  I have tried a lot of different binkys and my kids only want THIS one.  So what am I to do? Pay a ton for them on Amazon or Ebay, that's what.
Our 3 month old LOVES her lambie! We always have it with us and she even holds onto it when she doesn't want the binky in her mouth. The little legs make it easy for her to grab onto... It's a nice little security item for her. Obviously a plus that lambie helps to keep the binky from falling to the ground.
i bought this lunchbox for school for my 8 year old son.  it seems to be pretty well made and it has a long shoulder strap that is adjustable.  i cannot find any negative aspects to this purchase, i am completely satisfied with it and would recommend it to anyone looking for a spongebob squarepants lunchbox.
This has been a life saver and is super cute at the same time! No more searching for pacifiers in the middle of the night. I recommended purchasing 2 of them. I use 2 in the crib and there's never an issue at night with trying to find a pacifier. Which means more sleep for me! This is all my little one uses!
I saw someone with one of the Wubbanub pacifiers for their infant child.<br />So I ordered one for a friend who was having a new baby.<br />They love it, and the baby girl can hold it in her hand even though she is less than 2 months old.<br />And it's so easy to wash,,, just throw it in the washing machine.
What can I say, these are very cool.  I bought them a little early, as my daughter is not able to use them quite yet.  The nipple end of these are made for a little older baby (and mine is new yet), so she is on the young ones still.  They are really cool looking and I can't wait for her to start using them.
the pictures provided don't do this cute little swing justice. my son loves it! originally we thought a plug option would be better, but with batteries we can easily move it around the house or outside without needing an outlet. we've been using it heavily for 3 days and the batteries are still going strong.
I got this bc I wanted to keep my baby's pacifier on hand just incase she wanted it. I keep it hanging on my diaper bag so I always know where it is and never leave the house without it. I was able to fit 4 small pacifiers 0-3 months ones, I'm sure ill be able to fit less as she gets older n they get bigger.
Neither of my other two sons every took a paci, but my newborn so far has really gotten attached to one.  This product is AWESOME and really helps keep the paci in place as well as it's easier to handle for adults without getting their hands all over the paci.  I love it and plan to buy at least 2 more soon!
Love this! It's very soft with beanbag-like feet that make it easy to prop up next to a sleepy, fussy baby. Even though my almost 4 month old has started using the soothie part less often, she still likes to cling to the frog and cuddle it in her sleep. It's easy to wash and dry. We take it everywhere we go!
Thank you. I was so upset when this product was pulled from local stores. My little one has outgrown it now but it gave piece of mind when she was too big for a small paci and put the entire thing in her mouth,  yet wouldn't fall asleep without something. It was a great bridge for going from paci to no paci.
this camera (god bless its creators) is hte reason we were able to get a full night's rest after a year of getting up every 2 hours.  it was clear that we had to ferberize so we got this camera and when our kid would cry, we were reassured that she's ok by quickly glancing at the camera.  this product rocks!
it's worth noting that this spins very fast... so fast that the colors in the center blur.  it has beads in it that make a pleasant sound.  it is very colorful.  my baby is still young to use it, but so far my 3 y.o. plays with it from time to time, and i think it will be a hit with the younger one some day.
my daughter in law loves this. she saw it in store and i found it here on amazon. this is not cheaply- or poorly-made furniture. it's not &#34;carriage trade&#34; (high-priced, custom craftsmanship) furniture by any means. it's mass-produced. but it's not junk, far from it. perfect for a new (or repeat) mom!
My baby loves the wubs! He has 5 and now we're waiting for the sixth to get here today. We have only lost one that he dropped at a large department store. These are awesome because the babies can find them in their crib at night, they don't slip through the slots and they are soooo cute! This one is so soft!
we've only had these a short while, but we've had no problems so far. they seem very well made and have worked well for us. my three year old has issues with noise so i got them for him to wear in the car when his baby sister cries. we can still talk to each other, but they do a great job muffling her cries.
great carseat at a great price.  it is a tad bit wide which having twins, all but takes up my 2nd row with both these seats pushing my daughter out to the third row with hers.  the wings on the back are a bit wide which presents the problem.  but i am fine with it considering how great these are safety wise.
When the product was recieved it was packaged well and all portions of packaging was intact. The product seems to be of great quality and is durable. I intend to buy another variety of billy bob baby pacifiers in the future as my daughter loves hers! Thanks for the awesome product and quick shipping as well!
I love that these pacifiers are all one piece. My baby doesn't take a pacifier too often but when he does hes able to keep it in. He also really loves to just chew on it and I don't have to worry about him hurting himself. Compared to other pacifiers where the plastic is harder. He seems to really enjoy them.
i was nervous to buy this because so many reviewers claimed it was hard to get the baby in and out of the seat. my 6 month old boy is quite chubby, and he goes in and comes out of it easily, with plenty of room to spare. he seems to be sitting comfortably and secure in it. i am glad i don't have to return it.
My daughter started teething at 3 months and we had great difficulty finding a teether that she liked. After trying the ring and the hand, we fell upon the teething blanket. BEST EVER! It's soft and fuzzy and silky/satiny with 2 chewy corners. She loves grabbing the blankie and chewing on the ends. IT ROCKS!!
These are amazing!!! They really do smell like vanilla and the scent lasts for a long time. Our daughter uses them at bed time and I feel that she sleeps better thanks to the soothing vanilla scent. We'll be ordering more of these soon! A must have for every mommy that plans on putting baby down with a binky!
as a newbie parent, i still managed to cut my baby's skin using these scissors in the first month or so.  but after getting used to them, i love these scissors - they are so easy to use.  i also use them to maintain the length on my baby's hair, as i don't need to worry about stabbing him in the neck or face.
Great pacifier for my 3 year old. He is autistic and will not sleep without a pacifier. These are the only ones he hasn't been able to chew through. I do replace them every 2 months and I check them daily for any signs of rips or holes. They are soft but strong and I like that they are made of natural rubber.
We love our Wubbanub! It's great for my son who's not all into binkys, but when he's tired the likes to have this guy around to hold on to. His old binky would fall out of his mouth and wake him up. If this falls, he just grabs it, puts it back in and falls right back to sleep! Makes a great shower gift, too.
My daughter (3.5 mos old now) LOVES this pacifier! She can actually hold onto it at this age, and we can tuck one leg of it under her stroller or car seat strap so that it is easily accessible to her. We have bought two of them so we have one for the carseat and one for the house - would definitely recommend!
My kiddo loves this! Great for when babies are small. The nipples are shaped perfect for babies mouths and the animal makes it easy to hold and recognize. I always buy these for baby gifts and all the mothers rave about it and ask where they can get more. I have 2 of the same so I can change them out to wash.
My brother loves it, his wife hates it. HAHA  I think it's awesome. Baby wasn't sure what to do with it once she got around to trying it, because she was used to the round paci (momma's doing, no doubt)  They didn't even send me a picture :(  Where's the love? Gosh!  I'm totally getting this when I have kids!
works like a charm.  we don't have many accidents, but there has been the occasional diaper that gets too wet at night. a sippy cup of water spilled once and it never reached the mattress.  very pleased.  washes well, but allow for extra time in the dryer as it soaks up a lot of water in the wash.  naturally.
Whoever invented this is a genius!! The stuffed animal helps it stays put and not fall in the floor or get lost in the bedding etc.  And once the baby gets a little older and has more coordination the stuffed animal is a big help with enabling the child to hold on to and manipulate the binky. Great product!!!
if you have leather seats do yourself a favor and pick one of these up unless your leasing your vehicle and don't care about the condition you leave the back seat. the extra storage is nice up front and comes in handy. if you don't want it just tuck in under. well thought out design and has a nice feel to it.
i bought this as a gift but the family loves the item and uses it multiple times each day.  i wish i had known these were around when my children were little.  it's a great cross between a swing and a bouncy seat since it offers the comfort of a bouncy seat, the rock of a gentle swing, and it's off the floor.
We had the dragon one of these but my little one bit the end of the paci off and he doesn't sleep with out it. :( so we got a new one, the monkey. It's very soft, much softer than the dragon was. My little one seems to love it just as much as the dragon. They are machine washable and can be dryed on low heat.
I love these pacifiers. The design is cute and they hold up well in the dishwasher. My favorite part is that they come with a snap on cover so the pacifier stays clean in your diaper bag or purse. Much better than using a baggie or pacifier holder that just takes up more room. I will be ordering more of these.
My daughter absolutely adores her wubbas and we cannot leave home w/out them!!  I always take a few for our car trips anywhere as they're soooo much easier to find and hand her, the paci's by themselves require pulling the car over, as well as hunting for them everywhere.  So happy to have found this product!!
this is the coolest night light/ bed time lamp! well worth the $$$$. we purchased this for our 1 year old, and by the time night fall came our 11 year old daughter took it. not much of a hands on toy for the little ones, but it's defenitaly a great room deco. going to buy another today for our oldest daughter!
great little pacifier for a newborn, it's constructed very well, has plenty of airflow and the design does not cover the nose. i really like that it comes with a cap to keep it clean when not being used and it can be sterilized. overall i would recommend this if you need a pacifier for a newborn 0-2 month old.
Yup, they pacify the kid and they can truly be cleaned in the microwave. And they come in a sturdy box that the almost-toddler has not bitten, scratched or destroyed using brute force. Hallelujah! (Plus, these are not advertised as glow-in-the-dark, and I don't know if my batch was mixed up, but they do glow!)
my 6 month old loves to look in mirrors and even though we have a back seat mirror, i bought this one as a toy mirror for inside the house. it's great quality and the mirror reflection is amazing; not hazy or scratchy at all. if i ever did want to put this in my car then i believe it would install very easily.
This orthodontic pacifier was one of the only pacis my oldest son would take. Helped to soothe him and get him to sleep before I weaned him off. I'm still using this paci for my 2nd son who likes it more than any other style. This is a life saver for when the paci gets lost behind the crib and under the couch.
From the time my baby tried the pacifier she loved it.  The pacifier handle is easy for baby to pick up and hold up to her mouth.  The soft silicone is nice to the touch and feels great in the mouth (I tried it myself). The soft silicone pacifier soothes her when she gets cranky or uncomfortable from teething.
This pacifier is an alternative to the soothie, with the same nipple, but a better base design.  I love the product because my baby does too.  I received ours from the hospital and promptly bought more from the actual company at $1.75 for one, or for $10.50 you get 7.  It seems to be a lot better deal to me...
not much to say, other than it serves the purpose for what it's intended.  my child doesn't mind using it and was pretty excited when it arrived!  it cleans easily and doesn't clash with the other bathroom decor.  overall, it was a great price and my kid is happy with it, so i can't ask for much more than that.
Really bright glow in the dark. I really wish my toddler didn't reject them. I recommend starting these out on a younger baby--not a 15 month old. He was too attached to the soothie. For my next baby I will def be switch to these right away. They are really good quality. It would really benefit any co sleepers!
This is the best baby bottle sterilizer. It sterilizes 6 bottles at a time. It is not too big and bulky and best part of all, it dries the bottles. I have used other sterilizers that only sterilize and doesnt dry. This is a lifechanger. Also it is pretty quiet and doesnt make too much noise. Absolutley love it.
We love the giraffe.  Our baby is 3 months and she holds the toy which keeps the pacifier in her mouth.  The design is great that the toy is long and lays flat unlike some of the other ones we got (the elephant for example) and doesn't fall out.  I'd recommend this product and bought it for my friends as gifts.
perfect size for a toddler!  our son has adjusted to a bigger pillow, but our daughter is just getting ready for her own bed.  it really is the perfect size, i can't stress this enough.<br /><br />and add in hypoallergnic to it too.  we have a few allergy sufferers in our family, so we require this in a pillow.
are you confused about what kind of car seat to buy. just get a britax. the safety is great. the clicktight models have a nice recline, even in forward facing. i shopped around a lot trying to find a seat that was affordable and filled our needs. it was a waste of time. should have gotten the britax right away.
This item is great for my 2 month old and she loves it. Since she has really chubby cheeks, the other pacifiers that are more rounded tend to make a red mark on her cheeks. This item, however, does not have the rounded wings on it and it's a great item for her. I recommend this item to all chubby cheeked babies.
carter's purple floral printed crib sheet:  colours are as pictured (i love how the different shades of purple coordinate with different purples in our nursery), fit is great even with a mattress protector under it, washes and drys great, soft and doesn't get nubby after washing. great quality; highly recommend!
He loves his wubbanub. He uses it all the time and it comes in handy at night when he is searching for it half asleep he can find it easily. Hes like his little pal. Very easy to wash just toss into the washer and dry and its perfect very well made he has beaten the crap out of it and it is still holding strong.
A must have!  We have several of these attached to everything from our stroller, to our baby carriers, to shopping carts/high chairs.  Our son seems to be determined to throw his toys everywhere so these are invaluable to us.  We use them not only on toys, but also on snack cups and anything it will latch on to.
These are great.  I purchased two, because you never know when you might need to bring one with you.  We use Soothies for pacifiers, which EASILY collect pet dander or anything else on the floor.  These cases are great because I can pop the Soothie in there and throw it into my purse or my daughter's diaper bag.
we just purchased this set for our new baby and it is adorable. i've been looking for a cute pooh bedding set for a while and found this one at the last minute. the bedding soft and you can not beat the price. we also purchased the matching cribskirt and pillow and are very happy with the quality of the bedding.
Love the wubbanub, got it as a gift for my baby shower. Haven't lost it yet! And baby loves it. Bought it for a friend. Bought it from My Monkey Soup, LLC --simply put, great service! Ordered it Monday got it by Friday the same week! And the price was pretty decent too compared to others.  Couldn't ask for more!
Our little girl loves her turtle. We named him Bruno and he works just as advertised, she has even started holding on to the turtle as she uses the pacifier, but when she's not holding him he stays right there and doesn't fall out. Great idea for a product and excellent follow-through to make it a great product.
I tried pacifier after pacifier to no avail. Most pacifiers seemed to be too long and gag my newborn, but not this one.My brother suggested this one because it is the one the hospital gave to his son who was premature. My son liked it instantly. No spitting it out. This was even better than the Nuk for newborns.
This pacifier is so cute and could make anyone laugh.  I bought it as a shower present for my niece, and there's nothing like getting pictures emailed to you with a sweet baby using this bink.  It's a great little gag gift to include in a present for a new mom, especially if you tease the new mom about Twilight.
My 2 month old takes them and I am happy knowing my baby has a natural-material product in her mouth. I only use the pacifier to help me in the car because I don't want to hear her wail.<br /><br />Anyway, spend the extra bucks and avoid plastic and synthetics!<br /><br />I sterilize by 5 min in boiling water ;)
As far as I have been able to tell, these are hands-down the healthiest pacifiers available on the market.  I want to feel very comfortable about anything I allow my children to put in their mouth (especially for a prolonged period of time), and to me these pass the test.  This is the only brand pacifier we buy.
My daughter loves these pacifiers.  She won't use a regular one and we have several.  They are small enough for her to cuddle and I don't worry about the animal smothering her face.  It's safe for her to sleep with and easy for her to reach and keep in her mouth.  They wash easily and air dry in less than a day.
My infant loves these. They are high-quality material and the nipple fit in my daughter's mouth when she was only a few days old. She's still using them at 7 weeks and will probably continue until she graduates to the larger size. They seem a little pricey, but I am willing to pay a higher price for NUK products.
i am a busy work-at-home mom committed to at least trying cloth diapers.  we ordered pocket diapers from several brands: 1 fuzzinbunz, 1 blueberry, 1 bumgenius and 2 charlie bananas to start with.  we loved the blueberry mini so much we ordered 2 more minis and 1 more large one.  really easy so far and no issues.
works great as a security camera. it's flexible because you can position it anywhere. you can rotate the camera horizontally as well as vertically. low light vision is reasonably good, so is the sound. transmission and reception is great. you'll love this gadget. it is well built just like any motorola device is.
great pacifiers for babies.  it gives them something to hold while on the pacifier and after weaning our kids off the pacifier, we cut off the pacifier part and they had little stuffed animals to sleep with.<br />we purchased a total of 5 for both our children, and is our go to gift for our friends with newborns.
These are on our top-ten list for &#34;baby-must-haves&#34;. Absolutely love every aspect of them, the guilt free components (environmentally/baby safe), the easy to clean factor, and now that baby is older - the fact that this can be a strap on (with paci clip) paci and teether in one! So convenient and quality.
this is a really great color, and was fairly east to put up. does it's job keeping my 8 month old from sticking his feet through the slats on his crib and getting them stuck. stays up pretty well even with my son trying to climb it when he wakes up from his nap - just needs a little tug to get it back into place.
The hospital where my grandson was born used these vanilla scene newborn pacifiers.  I know from prior readings that vanilla is a favorite scent of men.  So when he needed more I didn't hesitate to order this specific pacifier.  He liked it, it soothed him.  I guess there's something about the vanilla that works.
We have tried what seems like every pacifier out there and this worked best for our baby. We love it because it stayed in her mouth when she stopped sucking which helped her fall asleep soothing herself. Other pacifiers seemed to pop right out of her mouth the moment she wasn't actively sucking. Highly recommend!
I bought my grandson 3 of these and they were perfect from the time he was born until he stopped needing a pacifier, these are great - so much easier for them to hold!  These are really durable, he was tough on them and they never fell apart.  I bought one for a friend's shower and she just loves it for her baby!
for some reason the top reviews for this sheet are terrible! i got these sheets very quickly, took them out to wash and dry, and put them on the crib and they fit perfectly. i have a sealy crib mattress with a quilted crib pad underneath and these did not tear, did not need to be overly stretched and are so soft!
We've tried out nearly all the major brands of pacifiers until a seasoned child caregiver recommended this one.  It's the only one my baby will accept, enabling us to use both our hands now that she doesn't have to suckle on parents' finger.  Being able to see inside her mouth while is suckles is amusing as well.
our daughter wanted a pacifier for her newborn daughter that was similar to the one provided by the hospital, but easily located at all times. the wubbanub is the perfect solution! the baby loves it! i purchased several different ones for her, featuring different animals. what a cool idea! no more lost pacifiers!
this chair is seriously the cutest thing ever!! i am so excited for my son to open it for his bubble guppies themed 2nd birthday party!! i can't even deal with how adorable it is!! it's seriously just as adorable in person!! he's completely obsessed with bubble guppies, so i know this chair will get a lot of use!
my 17 month old daughter loves this pacifier.  she is old enough now to visually recognize this passifier vs the other 10 in her crib.  she prefers this one.  i think (i am guessing here) that it is because the plastic is thicker and more rubbery for chewing on than her other ones.  i don't know, but she loves it.
my daughter decided that she didn't like bottles and refused to eat for daddy until we pulled out the big guns with this bottle set!<br />she was already jamming on the pacifiers so we decided to try the bottles and they changed my husband's experience.<br />these made all the difference. it's a brilliant concept.
this is a nice rattle because it's soft.  babies can't control their motions well but as they age a bit they get some real oomph behind their arm swings.  this rattle is soft so no worries of bruises or smashed fingers when baby pounds this rattle around. we like this and our daughter does too -- she's six months.
Tomme Tippee makes great products! I son has always taking to there bottles and also the pacifiers! These come in a 2 pack and they come in a nice plastic container that can also be used for storage in diaper bag. These are made with a hard plastic so they will last and hold up well! We love Tomme Tippee products!
As a mom and lactation consultant, these are the pacifiers I use and recommend. They're safe, one piece, easy to clean, and shaped the ideal way for breastfeeding babies - as you want them to use their mouth to suck. I like that this is a two pack because you always need one and a spare when it comes to pacifiers.
I expected the animal to be heavier but I guess it's best that it's light so my 1 year old can waddle around with it. She loves it because it's easy to carry around. I love it because she likes to drop or throw her pacifier and it doesn't roll away anymore, or I can find it easily if she's playing in her ball pit.
Since the day he was born, my son has refused to use any pacifier that doesn't have a stuffed animal attached to it.  He now has several WubbaNubs and loves them all, but the dragon is my (and now his) personal favorite.  It's pretty bad ass walking around with a baby who's got a dragon hanging from his mouth.  :)
Pacifier wipes are a must have. I don't know about you but my baby is always dropping his pacifier or sometimes I feel like it just needs washed off. I love these for when we are out and not where i can easly give it a wash. I keep a package in my diaper bag, one at home, one at Grandma's house and one in the car.
We got one of these when my daughter was only a few months old. She is almost 2 now and has to have the Wubbanub when she goes to sleep. It's like her best friend. Although she doesn't use the pacifier feature anymore, it's still a toy that provides her comfort. We named him George after Curious George. Great buy!
the base is a great feature. it prevents the brush from touching random surfaces. the brush sits wherever you want it. it is easily washable. the brush itself is of great quality. it held up perfectly for 14 months of bottle washing.<br /><br />i am now purchasing a second one for my second baby and one as a gift.
Wubbanubs as a whole are wonderful. My granddaughter can manipulate them fairly well at 6 weeks. FYI that the confetti puppy is a little fatter/rounder than the giraffe and pink bear, so it does not stay placed as well as the giraffe and pink bear due to its top heaviness. On a whole, these have been very helpful!
excellent adaptability for multiple sized spaces.  i've been using it to close off my kitchen from the living room during cooking times so little hands can't reach the stove, but i'll be repositioning it during the holidays to surround the christmas tree so little hands don't pull the tree over or break ornaments!
This is the style they give babies at the hospital. It fits small babies. The other ones almost cover their faces. Most of us are worried that they will get hooked on the pacifier. When they are just born, they will either go for the pacfier, or their thumb. I prefer the pacifier which I can remove once I want it.
My daughter is 5 months now and this is her favorite, we lost it and am now buying another. she loves to hug it as she sleeps, it is small enough to fit in her hands but big enough to find when you lay it down some where.<br />We have the loose ones that we put the cords on but the can get wrapped around her neck.
We got a monkey for my son as a gift and he loves it. The problem was he would drop it all the time. We ordered a dragon and it was to stiff, no flexibility. We started looking for something like the monkey and the turtle workers amazing. Sits just right not heavy enough to fall out when you hold the baby upright.
i bought this for my grandson and he loves it! it's colorful, bright and loaded with fun activities to keep interested and busy! it is also very lightweight yet durable and i am excited that even when he eventually outgrows the stationary bouncing stage i can covert it into a play station he can continue to enjoy!
I got one of these in the hospital when my first son was born two years ago. I have tried other pacifiers from Soothie and this is the only one that my newborn seems to be able to keep in. I was not able to find the Gumdrop version in stores, so I was so jazzed to find it here. The baby is happy, so mommy is happy.
Got this for my newborn niece - yes, I know she's a girl, but it's still funny... just makes a sleeping baby cuter and one that's fussy for hours a bit more bearable.  She doesn't seem to mind.  When she becomes a teenager and I have bribe pictures, well, her outlook might change then...  But for now, very cute  =)
this item is awesome. my son so wanted to sit and his neck was ready for that and eating solids, but he didn't realize that moving too much would get him to fall. this chair helped him get stabilized and now he sits without it. i also used it for feeding until my son was big enough for his kind of large high chair.
i love the idea of bumpers because my daughter sleeps with her arms straight out and was getting them caught inbetween the slats of her crib. however, traditional bumpers are scary so i was glad i found the mesh ones. they look nice and fit snuggly and keep my daughter from getting caught and give me peace of mind.
i bought the one that amazon said had cosmetic damage to it. i'll be buying anything amazon says has cosmetic damage. it looked brand new you couldn't tell there was anything wrong with it. my husband and i really liked that it had a built in screen so we can take it outside.  i'm sure our new little will enjoy it.
my little monkey finally got his first cold so i got to see this bad boy in action.. well it works.. and he hates it!!!  but it works so much better then the bulb.. its deff a pump sucking kinda thing.. i cant explain it.. anyway i never added tissue and i also never got sick as some said.. but it was just a cold..
i had a hard time weaning my lo from bottle to regular sippy cups. i saw this with a silicone spout like the sippy cup but at the same time it is soft like the nipple. after a few months lo started drinking from this bottle without the spout, doesn't want to let go of the hk bottle but hey - no more nipple / spout.
My husband and I love this bink link!! It looks really cool and it's so unique. My son loves it as well and is constantly playing with the beads. The length is nice, it's not too short or too long, and the clip is very durable. We use this as my son's going out bink link and we have gotten tons of comments on it!!!
nice set for a newborn or a first time mom. bottles were packaged nicely and everything was in it that was suppose to be. the pacifiers looked ready for use and the sterilizer was packaged separately so you didn't see it right away. definitely will enjoy this set when needed and ordering one for my new baby cousin.
I cannot stand the soothie pacifier because they hide my daughters gorgeous face. I have tried so many others and this is the only one that my daughter will take besides the gumdrop and soothie. I think it is because the nipple is soft like the soothie. Cute colors and great price. So happyl I tried these pacifiers
these work great. have had to replace some here and there from our son pulling on the too many times. these were the only drawer locks we could use on our cabinets. other brands that needed to screwing didn't fit the way our cabinets were made. (drawers have sliding cutlery drawers...no room to attach other brands)
great book! my baby loves the sound coming out of leaves in this book. it gets nicely washed if baby drools over it or chews on it. rhymes in the book are great and you can play nice peek a boo with this book and the baby. it's easier to hold and turn. every page has different color and it's very engaging. love it!
I purchased these for my daughter when she was 4 weeks old and at nearly 4 months we're still using them! They're so fun and much easier to keep ahold of then a single pacifier. Plus having something to snuggle with or teeth on is a bonus! They're light weight and brightly colored so she's still fascinated by them.
Hands down THE ONLY pacifier that has worked! (We have 3 kids!) Don't try all the other brands first! Get this one! I love the contour compared to the big hospital soothies and it's soo cute! Should we decide to add to our family, this one will be the one we do. These would make great baby shower gift stuffers too!
exactly what i have been looking for in a bath mat.  i arrived in a timely manner and products was just as described.  i like that it is clear which makes for better cleaning and it is superior to the quality of any other bath mat i have ever bought.  this product exceeded my expectations and i could not be happier.
have been using in our baby's nursery about 2 months now! works great and very accurate readings! the best feature is the color changing so we can see if the temperature is in right range from a quick glance when passing nursery. very happy with purchase knowing we can always have baby's nursery at safe temperature!
easy to put on and looks adorable!! absolutely love these decals. i even have textured walls an they still stick wonderfully and look great. they can be re-positioned but some of them did pull a little paint so i would be careful and try to only place once if possible. i got a few of them and the room looks awesome.
I used these for my first baby and she liked them a lot. We started using the pacifier very early (before she was a week old) because she would tend to suck on her mouth. In spite of this, there was no nipple confusion, and she was weaned off the pacifier by her 7th month. I've gotten them again for the second baby!
Soo in LuV with these..we just received the blue Okey dokey dino and the red dragon..we also have the monkey and giraffe. They are perfect for comforting, and binky doesn't get lost馃槉<br />Oh and free shipping was super fast..ordered on the 18th,  received on the 21st. We were supposed to get them between 24- 27,28.
bought this item for my new grandson.  he sleeps safe and secure no matter where you sit it....it's like a hammock for babies.  he is so much more a part of our daily life because it is easy to move him from one area to another.  positioning helps keep formula down also.  item arrived quickly and in excellent shape.
purchased  based on others recommendation and this is one of the best purchases i have ever invested from baby food accessories perspective. 1 oz portion is great size to have and you can pretty much store any food you like. and it's easy to get the cube out (just need to follow the instruction). highly recommended.
my niece has 3 puppies and i am babysitting this week.  i am trying your playpen inside before taking the puppies outside.  i am happy to watch the little puppies.  i have two large dogs and rescued them as adults.  this eekend will determine if i should get a puppy or a new resue animal for my house.  this is great
We just got this in the mail this past weekend and my son loves it! At 2 1/2 months he is able to place the paci back in his mouth when it falls out. He even likes to chew on the giraffes ears and arms! Before he did not like to take the pacifier and would only keep it in his mouth for a minute or two. Now it stays!
This pacifier is great!  After 3 months, once teething started, the baby loves it and it's been her favorite teething toy for the last 12 weeks.  She can hold onto it herself and learned quickly how to aim it into her mouth.  She likes chewing on the ears and legs sometimes too.  Its made sturdy, and its super cute.
I purchased 2 pacifiers 'Just Chillin' and 'Pull to sound alarm'. The mommy to be absolutely loved it and burst out laughing along with the guests. It was a hit. The picture doesn't do it justice. It looks very durable and very well made. I was very pleased and I highly recommend for all those with a sense of humor.
these blankets are all you need unless it's really cold out.  forget receiving blankets, nursing covers, a car seat/stroller cover for shade, because these can work for all of those uses in addition to swaddling.  i love that they're huge, slightly stretchy and breathable.  the patterns are unisex and simply elegant.
Both of my sons refused every pacifier except the Soothie for the first few months of their lives.  They even rejected the new Gumdrop pacifiers, which are similar to these but do not touch baby's nose.  Apparently my boys like these even though they look too big for a newborn.  Must be something comforting about it.
wubbanubs are great.I have twins who love them. For some reason this kitten one is about half the price of all the others. I'm not  a huge cat fan, but I'm glad I found these cheaper wubbanubs. I was skeptical bc they are so much cheaper than the dog and frog that I purchased last time, but they are exactly the same.
Our son loves this. It's helped him to keep his pacifier in his mouth. We also bought 'Gary' the giraffe. He's grabbing now and has figured out how to yank this out of his mouth. But it's great as far as not having a string attached to a pacifier. And it gives him something to cuddle too. Well made, easy to care for.
My son got all the goodies we asked for from the vibrating bouncer, swing, walker and more but the only item that he absolutely LOVES is his JUMPER. He is all over the place swinging and jumping laughing and having the time of his life.  I would have done without the swing and bouncer and stuck with this. IT's GREAT!
i ordered these for a shower activity (bib decorating)<br />to buy individual bibs from the local craft supply would have been about 5$ more<br />these are exactly what i needed - plain ol white bibs<br />i kind of wish that they had the plastic stuff on the underside but i was also not trying to spend a lot of money
works very well for elimination communication. our baby has been on the toilet since 6 months old and the seat is very well cushioned to support even the tiniest baby. we also got a cheap one from ikea and this one is waaaaay better!!! and it provides a lift to the knees which is a better body position for pooping :)
i have a very active 19 month old boy who doesn't like sitting still very long. this has worked great when we go to rodeos, trade shows, outdoor events. i thought he would get mad about it, but he really respects it and doesn't pitch a fit. in fact, he goes and gets his &#34;pony&#34; when we are headed out the door.
My 4th baby was born tongue tied and lip tied.  She has to relearn to suck properly to breastfeed or bottle feed and  the soothies are the pacifier that was recommended for that.  A friend told me about the Wubbunubs, so I purchased two.  So stinking cute and our little one loves holding onto the stuffed animal part.
Since our pacifiers came with their own clip-on covers, I actually use this for my nipple shield that is needed for me to breastfeed. It fits perfectly and is much better than the plastic baggie I had been using! It has a velcro closure and it's nice that the strap has a snap so you can hook it onto diaper bags, etc.
superb product. i can recommend it to anyone who has just welcomed a new member into their family. this saved me alot of exhausting hours rocking the hammock; which is what i experienced with my first child. it is worth it. my four year old son still uses it - that tells you how much he loves it and how strong it is.
This is the only type of pacifier that my baby will use. They are a great size, and easy to hold. You can buy third party pacifier clips if you want something to keep the pacifier from falling onto the ground if baby spits it out. These are also the pacifiers distributed by the hospital, so that's a great endorsement!
my daughter loves this she would only take this one she loved that she could hold it also its great for busy moms that cant keep putting in in and out of there mouth they love it bc they can hold it with there little hand and its soft to the only thing i could never figure out how to wash the caterpiller its self tho.
my 7 mo baby boy wears this continuously except when bathing or sleeping.  this necklace has been a lifesaver while he's been teething. i know it works because one day after bathing him i forgot to put it on......after about 24 hours without it he was fussy....put the necklace back on & within a few hours he was fine.
I bought these in order to have extras besides the one given to us in the hospital. I also wanted ones that were more girl since the one in the hospital was teal. This is the pacifier brand recommended me by my pediatrician - luckily it works with my daughter because it did not for my son (he never took any pacifier).
My daughter loves her Buddy as she calls it! We never leave home without him! It his is actually one I bought as a gift for a friend! She had seen my daughter's and asked about it for her newborn. I highly recommend these! They're cute and pretty easy to keep up with! My daughter likes to rub hers as she falls asleep.
Pros:<br />1. Does not leave a ring or red marks on the face like Nuk brand<br />2. Easy to wash and can be stored on a bottle rack<br />3. Can be attached to pacifier clips<br />4. Hole in the middle allows you to insert your pinky which stimulates baby to suck (at least it did with ours).<br /><br />Cons:<br />None!
the crib looks as classy as the pics. the quality of the wood is high and design is simple but elegant. i can't wait to see it turn into a bed. i am not sure how easy it was to set up because my husband and brother-in-law put it up while i wasn't around but it couldn't have been complicated.<br /><br />very nice crib.
This is my lifesaver. We give this to our toddler during bedtime. She has used this since she was an infant and it is so useful because she could grab it and keeps it from falling from her mouth. This also makes the pacifier easier to find than the traditional ones when they fall under the table, out of her crib, etc.
looked at all the photo albums offered. best one. i have no idea why people are complaining. i can see the photos clearly. my image in the mirror is a tad distorted but what do you expect it's a soft mirror . it's the best soft mirror i've seen. if you want to write a story put it on a piece of paper inside the album.
My son has the frog one and we bought this one so we have an extra! Plus we are Detroit Tigers fans! So when I found out they made a tiger one I had to get it because it's a very rare find. He absolutely loves these. They're so easy to clean. Wubbanubs are a great investment if your child likes the soothies pacifiers.
we purchased this rail guard to protect the convertible crib once our son began getting teeth. the top of the rail is rather thick and this guard covers it perfectly. there are 5 ties that secure it to the rail snugly. now there are no worries about baby ingesting the stain or about him ruining his future big boy bed!
the trailer arrived quickly and without damage. was easy to assemble. have not had a chance to tow the trailer so i can not comment on that yet. i did pack the bag with all my camping gear to make sure everything would fit and it does. very happy with my purchase will update after i pull the trailer a few time loaded.
this thing is pretty awesome. we live in texas and since my little guy is still in a rear facing carseat, he was melting this summer. someone suggested the noggle and it has been a life saver. i can easily adjust it depending on the day and can easily swap it out between my husband's truck and my car. it's a great buy.
My baby has had the Brown Bear Wubbanub from the very beginning. It is too cute. It was so easy for him to handle when he was smaller, and we never had to worry about him losing it. He is 17 months old now and does not use the soothie anymore, but he still has to hold the Wubbanub in his hand before he can go to sleep.
i had to redo the prints several times because i wanted them perfect, and that's what i ended up with.<br />the finished product is super cute, i wish i didn't poke a hole in it for the ribbon though, it kind of ruined it.<br />other then that, it's pliable, just make sure you have a paintbrush and clear water on hand.
this mobile is great because it is also a projector that plays cute music and can be used as a night-time music player much past baby years. it shines just enough light and plays music just long enough to be a great addition to your bedtime routine! excited to pass it on to baby #2 soon, if our 3 y/o will part with it!
These really stay in my baby's mouth when he stops sucking and prevents the nightime wakeup we were struggling with. He still can spit it out amd does fall out if he dozed in a more upright position. I think he prefers the feel of the soothe over this pacifier, but it's been a great way for all of us to get more sleep.
I used this bear to break my daughter from her pacifier.  We used her own paci on it for a while and then switched over to the included teether.  It actually worked!  She's 19 months old now and she still loves this bear.  She won't sleep without it.  I wound up buying a second one just in case she loses the first one.
I love this pacifier & so does my little one.  I guess he loves all the attention he gets when he has this in his mouth.  People are always doing a double take as they pass us by and then start to giggle. I use a paci clip that you can attach to the little holes on either side of the pacifier so my son doesn't lose it.
kidco healthy snack frozen treat trays work well. they're made of plastic, clean up relatively easily, and freeze well. my only beef is that the sticks don't have any teeth or grabbers so sometimes taking out a popsicle means pulling a lid/handle without the popsicle. i may end up roughing up the sticks to remedy this.
Everyone loves this thing, especially our son. Our little boy gets lots of compliments when he uses it... &#34;I love his binkie&#34;...&#34;That's the coolest pacifier&#34;. Long lasting, Eventually the MUSTACHE WILL COME LOOSE...WHEN IT DOES THROW IT AWAY because it becomes a choking hazard. Otherwise, it's a winner.
These are the best pacifiers by far for new born/ infants... It makes it easier to hold the pacifier in the baby's mouth and for them to find it in the middle of the night. The little animals give them something to hold onto...  We bought at least 10 of these on Amazon for our daughter and as gifts...  A+++++ product...

Great size! It will be plenty big enough for her inside shoes during the winter. Decent weight nylon, unlike some cheaper packs you can get at the general stores. Great buy and she loves it! Colors are true to picture too.The straps are navy, like the side pockets, with the trim and hanger in light blue like the piping.
This is the only pacifier my bebe will accept. All the others pop right out of her mouth. We tried them all! Light weight, squishy latex and longer than most. Not sold anywhere that I've found except for a random grocery store in Nebraska (and we live in CA)! I appreciate this offering and being able to chose the color!
I feel like a horrible mother since I have not gotten my 3 year old to get rid of these things yet (she went from taking it all the time to just pacifying herself to sleep which is an improvement). However, I love that the nipple mimics the nipple for most bottles, it also helped my baby with colic when she was younger.
I can never have enough of these on hand. I keep four of them around for my twins. I love that they help stay put with infants and they additionally seem to be soothing and give them something to grab on to. Also a lot harder to lose, and a lot easier to find in a diaper bag full of stuff! A must have for a shower gift.
i'm so happy to report that this fits my son's bed (he's a toddler in a twin bed). and the mattress is extra thick with a memory foam on it, and this is still tall enough to &#34;save&#34; him. :) it's quite long, too. which is great. very sturdy. my son shakes it back and forth in play sometimes and it doesn't give. :)
my baby loves this pacifier! it's his favorite! soothies are the only kind he will use. it's a cute soft dino and works wonderful! easy to locate thanks to the design! my son is sooo attached to it! we even named him &#34;waldo&#34; because whenever we need it we say &#34;where's waldo!?&#34; it's a life saver for sure!
I bought a couple WubbaNubs and they really help the little one keep the pacifier in her mouth.  My little one isn't old enough yet to find the WubbaNub and put it back in her mouth at night, but we find it helps when riding in her car seat, sitting in her swing or laying on the floor.  I definitely recommend this item.
these were an absolute lifesaver when breast feeding my second baby.  she had latch problems and i would not have continued breast feeding if the lactation consultant hadn't given me one.  now that i am pregnant for my third this was one of the first things i ordered to prepare!  great product would recommend to anyone!
MAM pacifiers are the only kind my kiddo will take!  I like these because when he inevitably spits it out at night it's still glowing - I can see it and pop it back in before he starts to fuss. I really like the sterilizer box MAM pacifiers are packaged in as well.  I usually sanitize them once a week.  Very convenient.
I had mixed feelings about using a pacifier, but when my baby refused to latch and we were forced to feed him breastmilk from a bottle, he needed some more sucking to soothe himself.  The hospital have us one of these, and we've used them since.  Easy to clean as well.  Buy lots! They tend to disappear around the house!
this pad is so plush and soft to the touch! my grandson rubs his little hand all over it as he's being changed! our other grandson loves the monkey design too! easy to wash/dry and return to the contoured pad -- has fit perfectly since we removed it from the packaging and cleaning cycles haven't affected the fit at all!
us strollers only have the upper cover for the sun, they are not adjustable so your child will get sun at some point.  this umbrella helped us keep the sun out of our 7 month old's face when we went to europe last summer.  it's adjust, so you can point it directly to the sun.  it's also a great way to protect from wind.
Each baby has his/her own favorite tastes and preferences,my daughter's totally different from my son's; however, this product was the only one my son would even consider.  I wish I had found it when my daughter was a baby, because as a parent I really like the fact that it is all one piece and made from natural rubber.
These pacifiers are compact, orthodontic, and my son took to them instantly. I also love the carrying case that can be used to sterilize the pacifiers in the microwave.<br /><br />I wish they glowed a little more brightly and for a longer time (they lose their glow after ~thirty minutes or so), but it's not a huge issue.
The glow in the dark feature is amazing! If you want it to glow bright for most of the night, hold it right up to a bright light bulb (desk lamp, or mirror lights in a bathroom work very well) for about 20 seconds. The Pacing will be so bright, there is no chance of losing it.    My son loves the fit of these Pacifiers!!
We love Wubba's at our house!! My son always had a hard time keeping his pacifier in his mouth which meant I was constantly putting it back in for him. The plushy on the Wubba's help the pacifier not only stay in, but make it easy for him to grab and stick back in his mouth. Especially helpful at night time. Love them!!!
I bought this pacifier to replace the puppy one we had that was lost.  I was excited when I saw that there was an alligator to chose from I had to get it since my son's room theme was baby alligator's.  This product &#34;Wubanub&#34; is a great product.  It is very durable and you are able to wash it easily in the wash!!
I too purchased other pacifiers and this is the only one that my son will take. I am nursing him and it has helped with his need for additional sucking after feeding. None of my other children would take pacifiers, but I bet they would have taken this one had I tried this particular brand. It is the best pacifier for us.
We had a Britax in Europe, so I decided to buy another one for the US. My daughter loves this seat and seems to be really comfortable in it. I read some reviews saying installation was difficult but I didn't find that to be true at all. I've used it both with the seatbelt and latch system and both were fairly easy to do.
Adorable!! I first heard about these on a youtube when watching videos on baby essentials for my unborn niece/nephew.<br /><br />I couldn't resist the reindeer; he's adorable. I love the fact that young babies can easily put this back in their mouths if they lose it during the night. I hope baby likes it when it arrives.
I love these pacifiers.  They are cute and functional.  My baby can put in her mouth.  While in the car, if it falls out of her mouth it does not roll away from her like other pacifiers, she just pops it back in her mouth.  When she doesn't want to suck on the pacifier part she plays with the stuffed animal.  Great item!
this is shorter then what they say,i read the other people reviews when buying so it was great for my 45 year old bassinet. my daughter has been sleeping on it roughly 3 weeks now and its doing fine it wipes clean very easy and sheets fit it well given that it is a little to short, i would so buy it again if i needed to.
We have 8 different Wubbanubs and they are great.  My daughter absolutely loves them.  The best thing about these paci's is my daughter can grab the stuffed animal part and put the paci back in her mouth in the middle of the night--saving my husband and I from having to get up and do it.  We can't live without Wubbanub!!!
Great and funny looking pacifiers. After searching through Amazon I decided to buy these because of the two different styles. The mustache texture on the pictures looked pretty soft. After receiving them the mustache material is soft and rubbery, not the hard plastic kind. This makes them even an better even better value.
I brought this for my 2 months old. I found out the Giraffe is slightly bigger and heavier than the other WubbaNubs. (3oz, 7 x 1 x 4 inches. You can find the information of each WubbaNubs on the product information / Technical Details). So, it actually stay better compare with the other WubbaNubs. Happy about the product.
i love this organizer. it fits my coffee, my camelbak water bottle, or any other container i use. it has a great closed pocket for money that no one sees so your money stays safe and two nice sized pockets for a key and a phone. the only thing i would change is to add a toggle to attach a pacifier or other leashed toy to.
this is a nice space saver for the kitchen counter.  you can put your bottles up there after you sterilize and let them finish drying out.  i've tried different racks but i really like this one.  it is plastic and the top shelf is a little wobbly if you have it at the highest height setting and don't have a balanced load.
this is a great product. it comes with a cover which is very convenient because you can close the it and it doesn't get dirty. it's also good quality, my newborn loved it. make sure this is the first pacifier you give your baby because they tend to like the first one they got and don't always adapt to new pacifiers later.
my son received a few loveys and this one was the one that he became attached to. we have to bring it everywhere with us. it really helps him feel comfortable in an unfamiliar place. i've washed it numerous times and the material really holds up. we are buying 2 more, in case he looses his beloved \\g-man\\. giraffe rocks!
We love the brand and we love the price! Reputable brand. My advise is change regularly.<br /><br />We also got the night ones, glow in the dark:<br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001L2SA3A?ie=UTF8&camp=213733&creative=393177&creativeASIN=B001L2SA3A&linkCode=shr&tag=swiclu-20&linkId=GF7RSUBA6H7S4S25<br /><br />Cheers!
Bought this for my 5 month old grandson and he embraced it right away.  He doesn't use a pacifier so he seems to find Dino comforting.  Holds it in his arms while he sleeps.  This is well made, bright color and soft to the touch.  Just ordered an identical one in case Dino gets lost and to use while washing and drying one.
Amazing baby item. Our 7-month-old loves it and smiles at his froggy each time he gets into his car seat! He can fully entertain himself swapping the pacifiers back and forth, cooing and laughing. It's wonderful for the car when I cannot be back there with him. It's the handiest product we have ever purchased in five kids!
I cannot say enough about these Wubbanubs but the lamb aka mimi has become my daughters favorite thing to her. MIMI was her fist word. Lamby has been a huge part of our daughter now 16 months. We had to finally get a back up after the first once finally snapped off, but it took a year of hard abuse before it finally broke!
For this baby, these have been the best pacifiers! The nipple stays in her mouth and they are nice feeling. I recommend getting at least two! Every baby is different, so pacifiers are trial and error, but we are loving these. Baby loves that she can take it in and out herself, and chew on the mouthguard for her teeth, too.
I bought these pacifiers at a reduced price for my honest opinion. I think these pacifiers are the cutest thing ever! They have the same pacifier shape as a normal pacifier. My son didn't like them because of the shape but when he had it in his mouth for a couple seconds I think it was the cutest thing I have ever seen!!!!
I bought this product for my newborn grandson (who wasn't keen on his 'regular' pacifier), having seen my other grandchildren loving their Natursutten pacifier. The shape seems to suit the baby's mouth & helps soothe them almost instantly when they are fractious. I would recommend this product to others without hesitation.
The soothie pacifier we received from the hospital is the only one my baby will take, but he's always losing it in his carseat when I can't stop and give it back to him.  The Wubbanub is perfect because it gives him the paci he loves and allows him to hold his 'toy' and he's learning to put it back in his mouth by himself.
My daughter LOVES the wubbanub! The weight of the kitty keeps it in her mouth much easier than a regular soothie, and I can even &#34;tuck the kitty in&#34; with another receiving blanket around her to keep it from falling. She loves feeling the plush and uses it to help get in her mouth herself now that she's a bit older.
thirsties duo wraps give the trimmest fit i've found so far, and i've tried blueberry coveralls, rumparooz, planetwise and thirsties. they don't cut into my baby's legs while making the waist fit properly like the other covers.and the velcro makes for a quick change especially if baby is being fussy during a diaper change.
I can't see how this gets anything other than a 5-star review.  The product is proportionally well created, with just enough lip to make any baby with a normal sized head/face look hilarious.  The teeth are overly large which makes the caricature that much cuter.<br /><br />This product is perfection from beginning to end.
we purchased this to use as a drying rack for baby bottles and breast milk pumping supplies, and the spacing is perfect to hold this type of stuff. wish they had a larger rack, but we just purchased a second one and it works great. easy to clean, and the included &#34;cup&#34; is great for drying small, easy to lose items.
this lamp looks great in my sons room and matches the rock n roll collection perfectly!  it also give off just the right amount of light.  it's not glaringly bright like the ceiling fan light but it's still bright enough to read him books.  the light is a nice soft light.  coming with its own light bulb is a nice plus too.
We love this pacifier. It's adorable and the owl is super soft. Our baby is just starting to grab things, and having the stuffed animal helps keep the pacifier in (sort of!) and gives baby something to grab to try to push the paci back into his mouth. (Or grab it out of his mouth, depending on how his arms are flailing...)
love this mobile! i was so excited to find this gem on amazon, since it is no longer sold in stores (i didn't find it at least) my daughter had one exactly like this 11 yrs ago, and i was so excited to find it once again for my new little one. this one is even better than i remember! you and your little one will enjoy it :)
i love my co-sleeper, my baby sleeps fine in it, and i don't agree with other viewers about he mattress, which almost prevented me from purchasing this bassinet.  while the mattress is thin, it doesn't seem to be uncomfortable for her.  i love the mesh, the lowering capability and the style.  it's a smart piece of furniture
although there are less expensive baby bags available, the lullabag is definitely worth the extra money.  the double zipper is a must have and is worth every penny--it makes nighttime diaper changes so much easier.  also, the weight of the cotton bag is perfect for the summer months or warm climates.  the quality is superb!
For a while these were the only pacifiers that my baby would take. I tried many different kinds and he would just gag and spit them right out. He was 2 months at the time, so it wasn't as though I was forcing a newborn to take some massive pacifier. These were great in the newborn size for my easy gagging child. Life saver!
But make sure you get a pacifier holder (that is compatible with this type of pacifier).<br />It is as titled, a soother that leaves parents worrying not about orthodontic problems later on.<br />There is a good reason why modern hospitals are equipped with these.<br />Bonus, also serves as a good early teether; mmm, chewy.
My daughter has lost so many binkies especially at night. Got these thinking glow in the dark wonder how she will like them. Well they are perfect! It's the only nipple she likes out of every brand and at night when she spits it out I can find it super easy instead of searching in te dark half asleep and waking her up more.
Love the Wubbanubs! These are great for child development & hand eye coordination. If my son wakes he can feel around and find this then soothe himself back to sleep. It's also easier for me to find in the middle of the night. Always buy a back up... they get attached to these and if you lose it you might a have problem! ;)
when my grandson eats with his long sleeve shirts on it can be a challenge to keep them clean.  i usually take the shirt off but now with this bib i don't have too.  it is soft and easy to clean.  i have even washed it in the washing machine.  the pocket catches what he drops.  love the quality and it will last a few years.
Baby loves these!  She was a little bit on the low birth weight side and we were having a hard time finding something that would fit her tiny mouth.  These fit the bill!  They are nice and soft and she has no problem with them.  She is a breast fed baby and hasn't had any problem so far (introduced the paci around 3 weeks).
I didn't want to give my baby any items with potentially harmful substances (Phlates & BPA's specificallY), so I was searching high and low for natural baby items.  I was very pleased to find this item and my baby loves chewing on these.  I like that these are natural products and I feel confident in giving these to my baby.
i read up on so many types of potty seats; from free standing to toilet attachments and this one works perfectly for our 22 month old.  we have never had a leak between the toilet seat nad attachment and he enjoys sitting on the extrememly comfortable seat thought out the day.  my only mistake was not buying 2 straight away.
works great and keeps our youngest out of the kitchen. we have an apartment where the kitchen is rather open, which meant that the kitchen has a rather wide entrance. this gate has kept them out where others have not, and also isn't susceptible to our youngest aspiring rock climber. great buy, definitely use the wall mounts.
yes, the other reviews are correct that the toy received is not exactly as pictured. instead my panda is in the middle and the pattern is slightly different, but all in all, it's the same. my son loves playing with this blankie and likes holding onto the panda. i bought one for my friend's baby too because i like it so much!
Perfect solution to finding a pacifier in the middle of the night.  I started putting it into the crib with my then 8 month old.  He didn't really pick up that it had a pacifier on it for a good 2 weeks or so.  Now it stays in the crib and when he wakes in the night for his paci, he knows to grab the bear.  Perfect solution.
My daughter loves her caterpillar.  Not only does the pacifier soothes her, the caterpillar soothes her while see sleeps. She loves to hold it and feel the soft material. It's was so said, we just lost it. It seems like it's harder for her to fall asleep without the caterpillar at the other end. We will be getting a new one.
My Godson love his WubbaNub Brown Puppy. He's just now learning how to hold his own bottle, hold things, and he is now interested in playing with toys. This is the perfect gift for babies who are just now starting to grab and hold things and if they are teething. My Godson never lets his WubbaNub Brown Puppy Go. Get one now!
My grandson loves his WubbaNub.  He snuggles his ducky and chews on the pacifier.  He does not use the pacifier much any more but he loves to snuggle the soft duck.  I have another grandbaby on the way.  There will be another WubbaNub in our future.  The problem will be finding one that the older baby does not want to steal.
just purchased this bed a couple month ago for our 18 month old to transition into from crib. it is quite easy to assemble and takes about 20 minutes. mattress from her crib fit it perfectly.  she just started using it and she loves it. it is very easy for her to climb into at 18 months old. i highly recommend for the value.
i bought two of these. i've configured it so many different ways to keep my child safe. i make an octagon like the picture. i've used two in parallel from wall to wall in my living room. i used half to cover the kitchen area. easy to build. no tools necessary. endless configurations. i've had it for 4 years. still looks new.
We love these binkies! They glow in the dark which is great. I would note that they won't keep their glow all night long but they do for most of the night. We keep a few of these in a bowl on the dresser so that I can just grab another one if the first one is &#34;lost&#34; in the bed at night. I would recommend this product.
I loved the idea. I gave it to my sister as a gift for her baby shower with a little remedies set ( no one ever thinks about when babies get sick they only ever buy clothes for baby shower). Its a something different but may still be useful. We will see when the baby comes how well she likes. I'll make an update at that time.
My baby loves this.  I want one of every style.  My kids all like to suck their thumbs, so this works for the baby.  They stick their thumb in the hole without having to wean off their thumbs.<br /><br />Also it was great for my newborns who don't keep a binkie because the stuffed animal helps the binkie stay inside the mouth
i purchased this skirt from guilt at a cheaper price. the quality is excellent. it's perfect for more modern nurseries/cribs. matches well with my babyletto crib. this skirt is similar quality with the babyletto skirt, however, it feels much smoother and look less wrinkled than the babyletto skirt once it is washed and dried.
Our baby boy used this and it helped to keep the binky in place, he would hold the doggy like hugging it while the binky stayed in his mouth. We got lots of compliments as to how cute he looked with that binky. I wish he liked pacifiers past 4 months so I could buy more of these, the are super cute and durable...good quality!
How freaking cute is this dragon?! I had seen the dogs and cats and bears, but I wanted something a little more interesting. What is most awesome is that he has had this type of paci since being in the hospital so he loves the paci iand the dragon. He gets excited every time we pull this out, and he loves to suck on the tail.
love these. just like the one that was given to us by the hospital. just be aware that these are different than the 3+ month ones. the 0-3 month pacifiers are thinner, where as the 3+ month ones are tougher and thicker. my son loved his original hospital pacifier and i bought the 3+ month one as a replacement and he hated it.
this has come in handy when i need to carpool with an extra child in the middle seat between my two installed car seats. the bubble bum is probably the only booster seat that would fit in the middle of my second row (i have a lexus rx350). i decided to purchase it after reading all of the reviews and i have been very pleased.
I love this! My daughter however has decided she doesn't like soothie pacifiers.  If only I'd had this for my first child, she loved this brand of paci and the animal really helps to keep the pacifer in the right place.  Now if only this company would sew other styles of pacifiers to stuffed animals, they'd have my business!!
The BEST Pacifiers EVER!!! They are so nice because they are all rubber and your LO can chew on the outside while teething.  If you liked the Gumdrop when they were born - you will LOVE these! They have a nice curve for the nose and it is easy for your LO to hold onto with the gripper on the outside.  Would not use any other!
worked perfectly! if you haven't tried these things and are using safety pins, which i don't feel are really that safe, give these a try! the teeth on them are sharp but it's very easy to get the snappi on without accidentally pushing anything too far and poking a squirming baby. you just stretch it over and release. so easy!
my 2 and a half year ols great grandaughter loves her doctor kit..carries it with her when she goes out..loves to chk out if you are ok.. i remeber having one like this as a child and was happy to find one reasonably priced...also purchased dora the explorer visits doctor and dentist books...she loves having them read to her.
I love my little wet bag. Every other bag is girlie. I have two boys. Ones potty trained the other in diapers. This wetbag gets everything in it and keeps my bag smelly good still. I wont ever choose a different bag. I also like the paci bag that came with it. In my house, I can never have too many pacis with me, at all times.
the stroller glides so well it seems to encourage you to move faster. the canopies have multiple positions to block out setting or rising suns. the storage below doesn't accommodate any large bags, though, there is plenty of room for loose items. the twins love the open ride. not a stroller for feeding them if you need a tray.
My baby doesn't like any pack at first. But with persistence, these pack works. Comparing to the Avent Soothie (very popular and has the same nipple), I like this one better because it has the nose cutout and also the holder has a hole for me to string through a clipper. Also, it's a good deal for 5. I rotate them all day long
Very cute, it is the only pacifier that my baby would take. The only downside is that for babies too young (less than 4 months) the plush toy gets in the way of their hands and the pacifier keeps falling out of their little mouths. But once they learn how to use their hands, they start playing (chewing) with the toy. Adorable.
really love the entire thermos foogo line. bottle is easy to clean, and i love that it has a good, secure lid. no, this is not a leak-proof bottle when the lid is open, but i don't think they claim it to be at all. it is leak-proof with the lid closed. i also love that the shape and size are very easy to fit in the diaper bag.
my daughter loves to drop things from her high chair, car seat, stroller or anywhere that she can her it crash on the floor. this works great to save you time from constantly picking toys up or when your out and about with your lo you can rest assured that your lo toy didn't fall out in one of the many places you've been to...
I received this as a gift from a friend and lost it when we were out walking in the neighborhood!  My son loves his &#34;puppy&#34; and called out to it.  I scrambled to find it to replace it and found it on here!!  Was so relieved!!!  We are reunited with &#34;puppy&#34; again!!!  Love this product!!!  Such a lifesaver!!!  :)
My 13 month old son only uses binkies at nap time and night, but has always needed two. To fall asleep, he likes one in his mouth and one in his hand. MAM is the only brand he will use, and I love how cute these are! The glow in the dark makes it easier for him to find if he moves around and loses track of the one in his hand.
was replacing my daughters old model that sounded like the falls with so much static.i was wondering about this one and was blown away at how clear and quiete it is.i used it to keep in touch with my wife upstais and it was a great help.she has passed now so i will retire them for a while but it was fantastic while i used them
My 12 week old loves this product. She snuggles the little lamb with one arm while sucking the pacifier. The weight of the animal seems to help her keep the pacifier in her mouth which is extremely helpful. I will be purchasing more, however I do wish you could switch out the pacifier. I'm sure this is a safety feature though.
These are the greatest pacifiers we have been using them for a while. My son is 2 and had a tendency to chew through the other all natural rubber pacifiers and would pop them. But he can't with the ecopiggies because of the hole in the back. They are a little thicker too so I  think they last longer and don't get sticky either
My title says it all.  This is better than any of the other ones out there, especially if you have a toddler that's always trying to figure out how to take things apart. My little one is obsessed! Thank you to who made this!!!  We use nuk, natursutten, and dr browns with this guy.  Only problem, where can we buy a pink one!!???
My daughter loves her Wubba!!! It has helped her with her hand and eye coordination.  She learned how to hold it, which then helped her learn how to hold regular binkies.  My only compliant is it seems like it has a 3-6 month soothie on it and not a 0-3.  It's a little large and hard for my infant daughter, she gagged at first.
We received an orange pacifier from the hospital while we were staying there. I couldn't find these in any stores in Canada, anything that came close covered her nose and she would push them out of her mouth. We ordered these online to make sure we have backups in case we ever lose the one from the hospital. They are wonderful!
we have the &#34;cera&#34; (triceratops) wubbanub to go with this rattle and they are both great!  one's for sleeping and one's for playing.<br /><br />the rattle:<br />high quality stitching so it won't fall apart.  noisy enough for baby without being annoying to dad.  super cute design for my little dinosaur.  can't go wrong.
My 7 week old is strictly breastfed and has a natural dislike for pacifiers. This one however, made the cut.  We have tried several kinds out there but this one had a good size and shape that there was no issue for nipple confusion.  I recommend trying soothies before other brands out there especially for breastfed ding babies.
this is a great product! i never knew how warm my baby's bath should be. the turtle makes it so easy just place it in the tub and the temp shows up right away! it is also color coated for the right temp blue for to cold, green is just right, and red for to hot! my baby loves to hold it during bath time! great product i love it!
My daughter loves her wubba nubs. I am going to have an all out war to get her to give them up. They are great as they are not so easily lost like a plain pacifier, but your child will imprint on these and clutch it constantly for comfort and love. This little elephant is particularly cute. Another favorite is the dragon style.
we bought this about 4 years ago for our oldest.. we still have it in the toy box and my 18 month old loves it. it also was a great hit for my now 3 1/2 year old son. it lasted great through all three kids and even at almost 5 years old my daughter likes to play with it.  we never had any problems with shapes not fitting right.
I keep giving this to my friends as a shower gift.  Thet all RAVE about it because it hooks to anything.  The dad's like it to because they can carry a clean pacifier without having to have a big bag with it in it.  Fits a wide variety of pacifiers and keeps a clean pacifier handy without  having to dig for it when it's needed.
100% happy with my stroller, well done to amazon on the cost & shipping to australia, it arrived 6 days earlier than predicted just before christmas.<br />the stroller is light, easy to move and very comfortable to push. baby is happy inside with lots of room and a very secure harness<br />thank you, i will be fit again soon :)
i like this. my son loves the projections although i wish there were a few more per page. that would be my only knock on the product. two projections per page seem to be enough, though, to help my son fall asleep so i still gave it 5 stars. cute pictures and i like that the music lasts an extended period of time. great product!
seems to be with all 4 of my babies they all preferred these until it was time to switch to the larger size at 6 months, then they no longer wanted them. I also like the design since it doesn't resemble a nipple or bottle, which for me it is intended for soothing after fed and changed to get back to sleep after I set them down.
I bought this for my 5 month old.  She uses the green pacifiers attached to it, so I figured she'd love this.  And, she does!  It's the perfect size for her little hands.  She enjoys feeling the different fabric textures and chewing on the arms/legs.  She's still learning how to put the paci in her mouth, but she's almost there.
My baby loves these! She will not tolerate the other types of pacifiers, she only likes these super suit is. I think it's because they more so mimic the shape of an actual nipple. They are great because they are actually cheaper than the other types of pacifiers as well. Use with a universal pacifier clip and you are good to go!
If you've had a child in the NICU, this is likely the pacifier they used in the hospital. We were almost duped by the GumDrop pacifier made by 'The First Years' brand but user reviews pointed us in the right direction. Having the same pacifier has eased the transition from hospital to home and our son continues to like this one.
I bought this for my niece --- my sister says hands down it was the best baby gift she received. My niece loves it! She likes to suck on the pacifier and playing with the soft texture of the giraffe --- plus, the weight of the giraffe allows the pacifier to sit nicely in her mouth when she's laying down. Ordering a second one :)
These looked so cute in the pictures and they are just as cute in person!  My first baby loved pacifiers from Day 1 so I figured my second baby would as well.  I bought a few different kinds to try them out but she just doesn't want any of them!  Still, I would recommend these cute pacifiers for anyone whose baby would take one!
excellent product and universal to fit any application.  the fabric is durable and pliable.  i was exhausted of trying to find a car seat protector that was not rigid and plagued with glue/seat marking problems. when i found this one it solved all my problems and i was super excited... and when i installed it i was even happier!
Both of my children love their WubbaNubs. The plush animal makes it easy for babies to find the pacifier at night saving mom from running into the nursery all night when they wake up. They last forever...even my toddler's tug-of-war couldn't rip the pacifier from the plush. Just throw it in the washing machine for easy cleaning!
I love these pacifiers because they are the only ones my baby will take. I've tried several different brands and types but he only likes these. He is breast feed and I think these pacifiers are great because they are similar to a natural nipple. I only wish they were easier to find in the stores. Luckily Amazon still sells them.
This pacifier has my nephew looking like (insert rapper name here)! The baby ladies love it and he's getting mad baby lady party invitations. With the addition of his velour track jacket, Timberland boots and low hanging pants showing a little diaper, this is the perfect baby ensemble. Can't wait to take him for his face tattoo.
my god did my babies love these....so much so they never took to another pacifier as they got bigger.  they would cry for these.<br />a word of caution:  once kids get a little bigger they can stuff the entire thing in their mouth and choke.  i caught my little ones a couple times with it nearly entirely in their mouth.  beware.
You know how normal binkies have a top/bottom, and you have to insert it a certain way or it won't be comfortable? Well, these don't have that! They are contoured for babies mouth, unlike newborn pacifiers, but they have no top or bottom. Yay! Also, they come with protective covers for stowing pacifiers in a diaper bag or purse.
whether you want this for decoration or as a toy, this giraffe is perfect for any age.  it is soft and has nothing that a small child could hurt themselves on or pull off.  my child has even snuggled it like a pillow because it is so comfortable.<br /><br />i think it would make an ideal baby shower gift and would be well loved.
I love the vanilla scent. It`s the only soother our son will use. The Avent Soothie is similar, but this one has a cut-out area around the nose, so you don`t have to worry about it possibly blocking your baby`s nostrils.  It`s easy to clean, unlike some pacifiers that will get moisture in them if you aren`t careful when cleaning.
I bought the giraffe one of these for my niece before she was born and my sister said it was her favority binky.  It gives the baby something soft to hold onto even if they aren't using it in their mouth.  I have since gotten them for other nieces and nephews and the parents have told us that the kid won't use any other type now.
These pacifiers are so much fun!  My 18 month old loves looking at himself in the mirror while he has them in his mouth.  The pacifiers are really great quality.  The mustaches are attached securely and I have no worries of them pulling out or breaking.  The plastic appears to be of high quality and durable. Very happy with them!
These are Baby's favorite pacifiers. I love the glow-in-the-dark front, it enables me to find it in the middle of the night so I don't have to turn the light. It's a very durable pacifier and I don't worry about him choking on the nipple. He has used just about every pacifier made, but this is by far the best, for him and for us!
as you probably know, most babies reject several kinds of passerfiers, then finally settle on one that they like, and you stop trying to find more. These were it for our baby.  They are wider and flatter than most- i think he liked that.  I like that there is no designated up or down, makes putting it back in easier.  Good luck!!
My daughter liked this mirror so much, we bought a second one. I have attached them to each end of her crib. They really keep her occupied, especially in the morning. I hear her wake up and start talking to the baby in the mirror. It's really soft and has a lot of little fun toys for her to play with as well. Cheap entertainment.
They smell so good I could eat them, I smelt the bag for a good 20mins same with my husband.<br />They were a little big for my son when he arrived but soon grew into them, he loves the smell of them.<br />Sadly they lose the smell once they get washed,mine did anyway.Even without the wonderful smell they are a wonderful product.
They are lifesavers.  They are cute to look at, and fun for the kids.  Plus they really help the little ones who don't quite have the motor skills to put their pacifiers in their own mouths.  These are much bigger and even the younger babies can manage to push them back in.  And they're easier to catch before they hit the ground.
i bought this for my 4 year daughter (before her birthday) and we have been pleased with how easy it is to set up and store. i have a 4-door pick up truck and this is very easy to install. it's amazing how the seat remains secure without the seat belt on when my daughter is not sitting in it. my wife and i have been very pleased.
i was skeptical at first on buying this. my daughter hates belt. i went on another website and they had there dapper snapper for $34. i was able to get this for $10 and i have to say that i am not disappointed at all. i will definitely recommend this product to others.  who ever came up with this idea hats off to you. thank you...
These are the best pacifiers! My son never got a sore on his mouth like you can get with other pacifiers. Plus by 4 months he was able to get it uin his mouth by himself most of the time. Not to mention that eventually you are going to wake up in bed with pacifiers and these are super soft so you won't feel it in the back as much!
My husband is a die hard Red Sox fan. Being from New England we just had to have these on our registry. I had my doubts about them since they weren't one of the big brands, but my baby loves them! He has a very deep palate and need something a bit longer than the average pacifier to trigger his suck reflex, and these worked great!
two friends of mine had these on their baby registries, so of course, since i think they are the greatest thing since sliced bread, i snatched them off of both registries and just gave them as gifts.  so cute.  so soft. love them. have even considered getting them to swaddle my dog...just kidding.  she doesn't like to be swaddled.
Love the holiday moose. The plaid accents are really cute, and this one feels slightly higher quality construction compared to the already high quality of other Wubbanubs. Purchased as a replacement to our first Wubbanub which lasted nearly 8 months of hard usage. If you don't have a Wubbanub, I strongly recommend them for babies.
I got these at a discount to try them and review them.  I would pay full price though.  I went back and got more because I love them so much.  They make the switch from plastic fun.  They hold up to the freezer well also, as I use them for frozen grapes.  The photo I took shows the small bags vs the larger version next to a penny.
You can do no wrong with the Billy Bob gag Pacifiers.  I bought one with 2 huge bucked teeth in the front and they were hilarious.  The grillz are for a girl and her father loved it.  The baby will not really use it as a pacifier normal wear and tear but when they approach their lunch or whatever friends, it is going to be a hoot.
Really nice little bear.  My 8-month old loves it.  Super soft and definitely well made.  The strap for the binky is pretty tight and I haven't actually switched the binky out yet but it's just a great little product (my little one actually seems to like the one it came with which surprised me).  Even nicer than the picture looks.
my 5-month old niece faith received this from me for christmas.  it is soft as butter, and intrigues our new little addition to the family.  she appears to love it as much as her older sister and brother loved their own 'taggies' when they were little.  it has been reported that she also perceives it to be a good pacifier as well.
Bought this for my six month old and she loves it. She carries the turtle around as her favorite stuffed animal and when she's tired she pops the pacifier in her mouth and pets her turtle til she falls asleep. All other pacifiers don't compare. Worth every penny for the joy it brings my little girl and the quiet it brings mommy :-)
This is the fourth one I have bought. Each one has been great. The best part? It is completely washable. Just throw it in your washing machine and it's as good as new. My son loves his dinosaur. He likes to rub the legs as he falls asleep. It is quite soothing. I just bought this one and the frog for the new baby that arrives soon.
My granddaughter, two and a half months, holds on to this little caterpillar and don't loose her paci'. Beautiful. So glad I bought it. Might buy more in different designs. One of these little gifts a new Moms at times can't justify buying, a great gift for grandparents if baby uses this kind of pacifier. Very well made. Recommend!
These are the only binkies my son will use!  He does not like the big plastic things on other ones around his mouth.  He is four months old and we have tried the MAM for two months plus and he will tolerate them.  However, he really likes these ones.  It is hard to find this size in the stores so we appreciate that Amazon has them.
Once you know which pacifiers your child likes then get them in bulk.  These have been through high abuse by our child and run through the dishwasher (top rack) many times.  They are easy for them to hold / pick up.<br /><br />If your child likes this style then these are great.  I would purchase again due to their high durability.
this was a great purchase- it's thick and soft, not flimsy at all (not sure why some reviewers would qualify it as thin!) and it's big enough so that my just-turned-one-year-old will be able to use it for the next couple years even as she grows! it's a great soft yellow with a cool print on the binding and inside the hood. love it!
We have several of these and continue to buy them for family members.  Great for new babies to keep the nuk in by just setting the animal on a blanket.  Great for toddlers because they put their own nuk in.  Easy clean, just throw in the washer and dryer.  Once there cracked just cut off the nuk and you have a toy still.  Win, Win.
i tried many different options before settling for dr. brown's. my baby took to the the bottles early on without any struggle unlike others (medela, playtex, etc.) and i only wished i had tried dr. brown's as our first option.<br />pros: easy to feed, no nipple collapse<br />cons: many moving parts, bottles come with level 1 nipple
My daughter loves it! Glow in the night. Never worry about finding the pacifier in a dark room.<br /><br />Great product!<br /><br />Another great product at a good price:<br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YDFOPE?ie=UTF8&camp=213733&creative=393177&creativeASIN=B000YDFOPE&linkCode=shr&tag=nealo10a-20&linkId=EDMQLSLRF3STUD5Z
Just received these today and my son (4 months old) LOVES it!! We originally bought the gumdrops pacifier for him, but he kept spitting them out. As soon as I put this one in his mouth he hasn't spit it out yet! He's been just relaxing and sucking on his new pacifier for probably the past ten minutes (which is a miracle). Great buy!
my grand-daughter is able to move and jump much more freely than in another one she has access to and uses at another home and will be happy in the rain-forest for long period of time (1 hr). i would recommend this to everyone.  i just think the fisher-price rainforest jumperoo should be available in local stores as well as on-line.
the pacifier is the one that hospitals use now.  My daughter wanted a giraffe theme for my grandson.  This is my daughter's favorite WubbaNub.  We just toss it in the washing machine.  I think it's just as easy to use a hole punch in the tab of the soothie pacifier and just slip a pacifier clip in, but my daughter loves the giraffe.
These are perfectly small for newborns and so adorable (I love the subtle design!)! They are both lightweight (VERY lightweight) and have tiny little covers that allow you to keep the covered area hygienic. The hard plastic case in which these are sold make these pacifiers fantastic shower gifts! (They are a set of two!) Love these!
These are great as baby gets older.  Lovey and pacy all in one.  Great that the adapter fits other brand pacifiers too!  We like thus one due to multiple textures, silky ears and paws and fuzzy body.  Washes well in washer too, but easier to snuggle with when Baby grows and it's hard for them to cuddle the wubanub since it's smaller
this rocker is perhaps the best thing that i have gotten for my baby!  she loves it!  the toys are big and bright and easy to grab.  the seat itself apppears to be very comfortable (she falls asleep when she is finished playing).  and perhaps the best part of all is that it is easy to pick up and take to grandma's house or wherever.
These pacifiers are all my daughter will use. We came home from the hospital with a green one. I love the pink and purple ones. I tried giving my daughter the ones for 3+ months, but she prefers the newborn ones, even though she is now 9 months. She can put them in herself, and she even like to chew on the back of them for teething.
The screen is nice and large, the image is much clearer than others I've had and the range of motion for the camera is great. I'm not sure you can beat it for the price. My sister has a different brand, a very common one, that is around $100 and it can't compare to the quality and functionality of this one. I'm so happy we got this.
I scoffed at these when I first saw them online, but was compelled to check it out after reading rave review one after another. They're the best. They are easy to find, they don't roll when they hit the ground, and much easier for my daughter to get in her mouth on her own. We have two for wash days and I couldn't live without them.
i couldn't handle putting my bathroom products away one more time!  the plastic products broke and i was trying to stretch my own rubber bands around my cupboards which wasn't working well.  the cords are really easy to use and durable!  my perfume and lotion bottles are finally safe and i can leave my bathroom door open once again!
My daughter will not use any other pacifier than the MAM pacifiers. She spits out the others and screams until we give her the MAM binkie.  I love that they have so many different designs. And I think I really should have invested in MAM stock as many MAM products as we now have around the house.  I would definitely recommend these.
i purchased this item for my 1-year old to use at daycare when she takes a nap. it is a very nice quality blanket for the price; so nice that i considered keeping it at home. it's very soft, a nice thickness and a good size. my daughter loves to snuggle with this blanket. it is a cute cheetah print and would make a nice shower gift.
is a cinch to use!  perfect swaddle on the first use as compared to other swaddle blankets which baby seems to always find a way to break through.  to top it off, you will find yourself photographing your cute bundle of swaddled wonder for hours.<br /><br />for more down to earth reviews of products, visit all moms are perfect . com
We got this bear for our daughter when she was just born and it has been her favorite since ! Along the way we got her a second one just because hers needed a wash and she wont be without it for that long ! Great product great price and so cute ! Also it was always easy for her to put the binky in her mouth at night ! Shipped fast !
I keep buying these for my friends that are expecting.  The ones that use them immediately love them. Babies are soothed and think mom is next to them because of the heart beat recording.  If they wait to give baby the teddy bear then the heart beat doesn't do much and you just have a regular teddy bear, nice but not what we wanted.
She loves this pacifier everyone else hates it but she wont sleep without it just order a couple more cuz I cant fine any other that she would keep with out trowing it she takes care of it and doesn't loose it its adorable seeing her with it...I absolutely love it just order 4 more cuz when I misplace it and I only have one its hell!
we ordered these at 5 months, and really regretted not getting them earlier. she loved playing with the legs of the ladybug and the antennae of the bee. our daughter is 12 months old and still loves these. she carries them around with her all over the place. i like that they're small, but too big to choke on. i highly recommend them.
The only pacifier that our baby would consistently take. Great to be able to get several at a low price so we could keep one everywhere we needed it - diaper bag, daycare, nursery, car seat (our car seat has a little tag that is at the perfect location to have the pacifier reach the baby when used with an Ulubulu pacifier clip), etc.
This is my daughter's favorite. We have multiple but this one is so soft and sweet. You will not be disappointed. When u need to clean just out then in a cotton pillowcase and run through the washing machine and low dryer setting. Our baby falls asleep with this and then holds into it in the night like a baby. So sweet and they work.
I've had 5 breastfed babies, 4 of whom completely refused any kind of pacifier. My youngest baby is a month old & seems to really like his Natursutten pacifier! He still prefers the breast for comfort, but will take this pacifier in the car or when someone else is holding him. I'm ordering 2 more today so we always have one one hand!
For the busy, on the go mom who doesn't have time to boil water in the pot to sterilize pacifiers, this is a great, relatively-cheap product. Simply place the blinkies into the turnover, and oola you can sterilize them in the microwave!<br /><br />The product is BPA free, which is a must in my book for all children-related purchases.
Great all in one. Pacifer, teether, and its WASHABLE. All of it! She loves to chew on tbe legs and the antlers. I dont worry about the beans coming out bc they are sown into their own little compartment. We have a different Wub for each diaper bag and the crib. Most of the time she just likes to hold onto it. Thanks for this product!
bought these to use on my baby to wipe his little bum.  works great!  it is soft and absorbent and cleans up well without having to use multiple cloth wipes.  bought 2 sets and its the perfect amount of wipes..as we wash every other day.  i will probably purchase another pack of wipes just to use to clean up his face after his meals.
As with most babies that take a paci, It falls out and they cannot put it back in. This solves that problem. I would lay the baby to sleep on their back, put this on their stomach with the soother in their mouth, as they fell asleep, a lot of times, they spit it out, but when they would wake, they would root around and find it again!
these are perfect for bottles needed away from home. we don't have to carry a large formula container around and we also don't have to premix and worry about refrigerating or it going bad if not used in the day we mixed. it's nice to just fill with formula and pop into a bottle filled with water and keep separate until ready for use.
works well with our baby.  we haven't had occasion to fold it up yet, but i'll be glad to have that feature if we need to store it away.  it's fabric is detachable and washable and the tray liner comes off for cleaning.  the tray is fairly easy to adjust back and forth.  we haven't had any issues and have enjoyed using this highchair.
we bought this for my granddaughters 6th birthday.  she was thrilled with it and couldn't wait to get it home to her own room.  it was very well packaged with each piece of wood individually wrapped in packing paper so as not to get scratched.  it was quite easy to put together and is perfect for her.  i highly recommend this product.
It took a while but now at almost eight months, WubbaNubs are all our little one will use.  She would use them occasionally early on but now they are her go to when she is just tired or ready to nap.  They are easy for her to find in the crib in the middle of the night.  Months ago, they were nice in that they kept it up by her mouth.
I absolutely love the wubbanubs and my son does too. The dragon is by far my favorite and my son loves to hold onto the legs and wings. I just wish I could change the pacifier out. Other than that I love it. I think they were worth the price even with how much my son loves them! I would recommend buying 2 though for when one is dirty.
it really does make more room. before the angle adjuster, my husband couldnt drive my car because even though the car seat is in the middle, the front seat would be blocked from moving back from hitting the side corner of the car seat (rear facing). we got the angle adjuster and it gave so much room. i am 5'2 and my husband is 6 foot!
Purchased as a baby shower gift for a friend. The actual pacifier is clear, leaving you to see that cute little face beneath and it is BPA free. The mustache is removable as necessary, body friendly silicone, and the most adorable thing you ever saw! My friend absolutely loved it, she laughed with unfettered mirth over the idea of it.
my granddaughter is crazy about elephants and she has many stuffed ones on her bed.  i got this for her room after it was painted and time to redecorate.  these elephants and birds look great!  she loves them.  i did not want to apply them directly to the wall so i pressed them onto contact paper and cut them out to place on the wall.
this is what we needed a simple monitor that does the job in a larger house without breaking the bank. i have other things to do that with. we do not get static. this is our second one due to our 10 yr playing with our old one and breaking it no fault of the monitor. looked around and this gets a great range for the price and quality.
I can't rave about this product enough. It is perfectly designed to stay in Baby's mouth and easy for him to grab and put into his mouth himself. Also easy for Mom or Dad to find in the crib the middle of the night without turning the lights on. From now on I will buy one to attach to the package of every baby shower gift that I give.
this is cute, double sided and works well. it's not super heavyweight so if there's a big gust of wind it might blow up, but i like that it's light enough for me to know my baby can breathe well under it. it also washes great! i like that if i have a boy later on i could swap the sides and the red/white pattern is more gender nuetral.
I had trouble finding a pacifier holder for the soothie pacifiers that would keep them clean in the diaper bag. This little pouch works great and you can cram up to three soothies in there with ease. It can also be snapped to the diaper bag, carseat or stroller to make it easier to find for those meltdown moments. It is what I needed.
My daughter is obsessed with these, and used the 0-3month kind constantly, although I was against using them at first.  They don't mess up latching or feeding at all, which is lucky, and she feels very soothed by these.  They are soft and seem to always look new and not chewed up ever.  She uses them constantly, so that is impressive.
love the zipper protection. works great for keeping bodily and animal fluids from ruining the mattress. my dog is normally great, but had a bladder infection and wet the bed. this saved the mattress and it all washed out! the terry cloth is also a huge improvement over the cotton tops because it doesn't get caught and pull/fall apart.
I attached this to my baby's mobile above his crib when I was sleep training, and he never cried longer than 5 minutes. He wakes up, finds his binky and goes back to bed. It's changed my life. My baby is 6 months old. I did have it attached to his carseat for about a week or two so he learned how to use it before I used it in his crib.
my 15 month old got this for her birthday three months ago and it has been a huge hit. if it is within her sight, it must be playing. she will stop whatever else she is doing to hit one of the buttons and reactivate it if the music stops. it's a nice bonus that the music isn't as irritating to listen to as many other baby/toddler toys.
convenient (and fun) for travelling with a toddler and a lot easier to tote around than a pack-n-play. it literally twists, folds up and stores neatly in the flat, round zipper bag shown and pops right back open when you pull it out. same amount of flaps as a backpacking tent and seemingly made of the same durable, but light, material.
i love my orange tree!  it looks beautiful in my baby son's room.  it's a beautiful design.  i also like that the growth chart doesn't already have inches or feet on it.  so, i can choose how high i want to put it on the wall.  and if for some reason i never mark on it with my boy's growth, it is still a beautiful art for the wall!  :)
We love our wubbanub! It's great for little fingers which are still gaining their motor skills. It's easy for babies to grab and put in their mouths when they have the dexterity to do so. It's also easier for newbies to knock out of their mouths if their arms move around while they sleep. We swaddled so didn't really have this problem.
well made couch. i really dislike some of the cheaper couches with certain types of material. i found this and its a nice mico suede. my son loves it and it holds its shape really well with him standing on it and trying to get up on our big couches. its easy to clean and seems to be well made. its very light weight and is a great size.
our 6 month old (now almost nine months) opens right up when he sees this during bath time. i guess he likes how the bristles feel against his tongue or the numbs on his gums. often we just let him chew on it because he takes to it so easy and it's a real gentle rubber.<br /><br />excellent way to help start building good oral hygiene.
this works!  i can't tell you how many things i tried to soothe my screaming baby - all the &#34;old wives&#34; remedies, and a few things i found at the drugstore. nothing worked. finally i found this tea. i liked that it was natural, so i ordered it. i can tell you that my little one is now calmer, sleeping better, and i am thrilled.
Safety first has made giving meds much easer for your little ones. No one wants to hold down a child and try and spoon the meds into a closed mouth. Now with this little pacifier you don't have to do that. Most babies are used to a pacifier and will just take it right away. The most unique to give meds. Way to go Safety First you rock.
i bought this cute little guy for my daughter. it is to replace the \\turtle\\ version of the same product that the light has burnt out in. she can't go to sleep with out these guys, she loves them! she is seven. they make the most beautiful stars around the room! i am going to see about a replacement bulb to bring turtle back to life.
love it.....have tried softbums, g-diaper,grovia,kawaii.....a little pricey`but quality is worth it. i have a few omni's and some of the cheaper ones so i can alternate without having to wear out my softbums by using everyday. hold in leaks/blowouts on my 5 month old great. love that you can insert more or less inserts. great product!!
I never knew what a wubbanub was until my friend asked me why my 3 month old didn't have one. I went online that night and ordered two! The package arrived promptly, and my daughter loves them. They are nice because as your baby develops her fine motor skills she is able to learn how to put the soothie in her mouth herself. Great buy!!
this wrap is amazing. this is my third baby and nothing compares to the quality and convenience of this wrap! the fabric is sooo soft and it took me no time at all to figure out how to wrap my baby in it properly. i've been using it for two months and am considering getting another because i love it so much. you won't regret buying it!
i couldn't be happier with this set!  i'm expecting my first little girl, but i'm not a pink girl myself, so when i found this set i was in love!!  for the price (some sets i liked were well over $200!) this set was worth the $$$.  and personally, i did not want a bumper, so i was happy to see this set was available with either option.
I searched everywhere locally for a one-piece, non-latex, and BPA-free binky. I finally decided to look online, and ordered these for my daughter. I love them! My daughter doesn't naturally take to any pacifier, so we had to encourage them for a few days. Now she loves them too. I buy them as gifts and recommend them to everyone I know.
These are the only pacifiers my daughter will take, and they are hard to find nowadays. You don't get to choose specific colors, but who cares? Your baby couldn't care less about what color their sucky is, but if you're the type who gets butt-hurt if you don't get everything the same color or if your boy has a pink paci, look elsewhere!
excellent sleep sack for warm nights.  the material is like a thick soft t-shirt, and the wide top to bottom zipper and snaps on the shoulders make it easy to get on and off.  we like it so much we bought another.  we also have the regular thickness sleep sack for cool nights and highly recommend both.  they are worth the extra expense.
This is the next natural step from Soothie pacifier to teether.  Great idea!  I noticed that my daughter was starting to pull her Soothie pacifier out and chew on the sides when she was 3-4 months old.  I saw this on Amazon, and thought it made sense.      It's a great, tough, solid piece teether that she can use as a back- up pacifier!
I purchased this as a gift for my friend who is having a baby, my daughter loves hers and it is part of our nap/bedtime routine. It also makes it much easier to find in the carseat while in the car. Washing is easy, we just put it in a pillow case and run it in the washing machine then let it air dry. Never leave the house without it :)
I used MAM bottles for both of my children.  I haven't seen them lately in stores though.  When my cousin asked me my opinion about different bottles for her new baby I immediately recommended these.  Since we couldn't find them in stores, I ordered them here.  Free 2 day shipping, and my new baby cousin is loving these bottles.  Score!
Not only is it so flippin' cute (well, it is a giraffe!) but it is very useful. My 4 month old son loves to hold things when drifting of to sleep, and helps to keep the binky in his mouth! He is a preemie and his sucking ability isn't very strong. He holds on to it quite tightly! Only bad thing is you can't replace the binky if damaged.
My nephew is 7 months old and from birth he used the Soothie pacifier and loved it so when he started teething, I wanted to get him something similiar to what he was using and this was perfect, he loves to put things in his mouth and the texture of this is great, although he dosen't like to use it as a pacifier, the nipple is different.
this product is beautiful and better than i expected.  it is well made and i have recommended this product to my friends for the excellent quality of this product.  it is a must buy and well worth the amount i paid for it.  i am extremely pleased with this product and will buy again from this seller due to the quality  of the product :)

Just received mine in the mail, and I am in love!!! This stroller is Super Sturdy, glides across the floor and seems to be super cushioned for baby. I love how large the basket is and there is tons of storage. I am totally, totally in love.  I just can't wait to use it when the baby comes. Everything I expected and more. Thanks RECARO馃挄
i received this as a gift from a hospital when my child was born. i tried swaddling my baby with a regular blanket numerous times, but i was too exhausted to fix it over and over. i loved this so much that i ordered two more; one with micro-fleece and one made out of 100% cotton. my daughter wears it on a daily basis and keeps her warm.
The best baby shower gift I ever received.  I bought this as a replacement since we lost ours for a bit ( never hurts to have a backup).  This became our sons beloved toy and comfort pacifier at all times.  We have now weaned him off at a year and a half.  But, we will definitely be purchasing another type of WubbabNub for our new baby.
I really like this little thing. I attached it to the handle of my diaper backpack and it's easy to find a pacifier when my baby is screaming in my face! Only holds 2 pacifiers though. No idea what could possibly be stored in the tiny outside pocket. Maybe an ibuprofen for the headache you get from the screaming baby in the first place?
My wife bought this for her godson, and he loves it. It was smaller than she had pictured, but ended up being the perfect size for him. Talking about size, the monkey is the size of beenie baby. She said the only thing she didn't like was that the actual pacifier can't come off to be cleaned. Her friend bought pacifier wipes to clean it.
used for my newborn...4 mo old now and still using. was 4 days late so these aren't only just for preemie babys. great to use if you're also breastfeeding. ordered 6 to go with the 6 dr browns bottles i ordered on amazon. will probably order more bottles. keeping the size 1 nipple that came with the bottles on standby for the next stage.
My oldest daughter picked this out for her new little sister and she loves it! It is super cute and stays in the baby' s mouth which is a huge blessing. It is very cute and you can wash it in the washing machine, just put it in a bag. The only thing i didnt like was the price, which i do think is a little high, but it is a great product.
my son is a pretty active sleeper, and we were having trouble with him kicking out of his blankets, getting cold, and waking us up.  these pajamas (particularly the long sleeved ones) solved that issue.  my son sleeps comfortably, and i don't have to get up as often in the night, as he is still warm, even if he kicks out of his blankets.
I bought this for my new grand daughter.  She had the Big Red Dog, Clifford WubbaNub but I wanted her to have a little girly one.  I bought this one and the caterpillar.  She loves them all.  And, unlike a single Nub, these are pretty difficult to lose.  Not too big, and not too small.  Soft as can be.  You'll be tempted to buy them all.
really cute. ithey're made of lightweight plastic. only thing i would change is the fork & spoon, they're just too wide for little mouths. the fork tines could be spread apart further to make it easier to stab the food & keep it on the fork, and the spoon just needs to be narrower. the elmo handles are easy to hold onto and so darn cute.
These are my daughter's pacifier of choice.  We still can't live without them.  I like that they don't have a right side up, and it is nice that the are orthodontic approved.  We need to cut the habit soon, but are in the middle of moving...so until that is over...we will be purchasing more pacifiers, as she tends to lose them regularly.
The only ones my boys took. Every baby is different so I can't rate based on that. Personally though, these pacifiers saved my sanity. I spent a lot on pacifiers, tried different brands. These were the ones. BUT they are so much cheaper in stores (burlington, less than half the price).<br />So now how do I get my 2 year old off of them?!
i was just a little perplexed, but quickly figured out how to setup this pack 'n play, break it down and move it to another location in the house. it's very sturdy and useful with its changing bed, and higher bed for our daughter's newborn. i am older and it's easier for me with this play yard to work with my grandchild when babysitting.
My daughter used these pacifiers until she was a year old. She loved them, I liked that they are all natural. The only bummer was they are a bit expensive so I was a bit obsessed with not losing them. We used a pacifier chain to keep tabs on it. They also need to be replaced after a bit. Still, my daughter loved them so I can't complain.
Purchased these for my son's 1st birthday.  He loves to throw and kick balls around.  These are perfect for his little hands. The nubbies make it so easy for him to pick up and hold the ball.  It also makes it easier for him to play ball with his older brother.  Both of the kids throw these around.  They get played with on a daily basis.
We love this paci! it's not thick and has a very nice design. It's surely different than the other ones available on the market. It's worth the price, because it doesn't suck the air around his mouth.  The only con it has, is it retains water whenever i sterlize it so you need to make sure to remove it before you give it back to your LO.
i left this outside all summer and most of fall.  our child loved it. i ordered a second one for our home.  it'd durable, quality, and has some substance to it.  i threw out some thin mats we had purchased before this one.    update: it's two years later, the kids still like these, and they still look great.  they are very easy to clean.
I just bought a bunch of these because they're difficult to find in stores now.  This is our third child to use this pacifier.  My first and third son use/used these exclusively.  My second son preferred another brand but would use these in a pinch.  I have tried many other brands and these stay in better than any pacifier we have tried.
buy this. seriously. well, first have a baby. but then you should buy this. we have our first little girl and she just moved into her own room. it is so convenient to check on her without opening the door and potentially waking her. also: we have now traveled twice with it and we use it at family and friends' houses. seriously. buy this.
These are great pacifiers. My baby prefers the shape of the Nuk pacifiers over other brands:  the exterior is curved down below the nose and the orthodontic shape of the silicone pacifier.  Plus, the sports theme is very cute.  I did buy these at a local retail store so I could choose a package that include a baseball + football pacifer.
when i received this, i was delightfully surprised in the classical music.  i happen to love it.<br />not only is this toy easy to hold, and really adorable, i think the classical music makes it a<br />little different from the rest, and maybe even more comforting while taking my great grandson<br />is going to sleep.  couldn't be better
These are a life-saver! When a tired parent stumbles into the nursery to find the lost pacifier for a crying baby, these glow-in-the-dark pacifiers come in handy!! Just look for the green orb and there you have it! I purchased these for a baby gift, I use the larger size ones for my own little ones. Definitely a must-have for new parents!
My son uses mam pacifiers and I highly recommend getting these glow-in-the-dark pacifiers! I originally purchased one pack and then bought two more. Easy to find in the middle of the night without turning on the light. I place them under his bedroom lamp during the day and they glow bright longer at night and during nap. Great pacifiers!!
The only paci that my 3 week old son will actually suck on. It has to be the vanilla since we bought some at another store (same ones with no vanilla scent). These are the ones the hospital here gives out to new mommies/newborns. I wanted a couple extra. I just wish they would scent the ones for older babies just in case we may need them.
After Gerber changed their latex pacifiers with the rounded ends, I went through literally pacifier after pacifier trying to find one my son would take so I could get some sleep.  These are absolutely the only ones he will take.  The only bad thing about them is they are VERY expensive.  However, it's worth it to get a good night's sleep.
I love this kit.  Everything in this kit is a necessity and works well.  My only complaint is the nail clippers.  They are a bit big to use on a newborn... <br />Oh, and I wish I knew what hospital the lady went to that received all of these products...I got diapers and a formula bag...I had to sneak the t-shirt and blanket for memories!!
We tried 5 other pacifiers for our son after he was diagnosed with acid reflux and were told that crying can cause more irritation and reflux. He didn't seem to like any of them.  We decided to give these a try and he loves it.  I plan to stock up on them. I highly recommend these to any parent of a fussy baby who refuses other pacifiers.
My son loves pacifiers, especially since they used them to soothe him in the NICU. I wanted something bigger, that would allow for further orthodontic development. My son prefers the silicone ones, as he also uses them as a teether the hard orthodontic part is completely sealed in by the silicone, and it's just easier to keep clean. Yay!.
These are the same pacifiers my son was given at the hospital and i love them. They are better than the ones they sell at babies r us or the baby stores because these have the shape of the mouth and it doesn't look like its taking over his mouth (compared to the one that is a full cirlce). He won't take any other pacifier. They are great!
had the tommee tippee cups for a bit, got these and switched over. you can see how much liquid is left inside, and they are easy to clean and put together. milk can splatter a bit if the child lets go of the straw before the liquid is finished, but only the amount between the valve and straw end (1.5&#34; worth), so much better than most!
Our daughter came home from the hospital with 2 binkies, and they made life great, till she stopped taking one for about a month and a half.  We tried them again in frustration, but as she was closer to the 6 month range, we tried a mam style i had, and she loves them, and doesn't sleep without it! Shes is a much calmer baby with Binkies!
As the mom of two kids this wasn't around my first time as a parent, and I wish it was. Great product for little ones who have the tendency to spit their pacifiers out and then lose them. The cute doll gives a baby something to cuddle with as they soothe themselves. I highly recommend these as shower gifts, they are cute AND super useful.
This tiny little pouch is such a lifesaver living in nyc where everything is dirty. I attach this to my stroller and keep teething toys and crackers clean and accessible. It works well with a pacifier of course but we don't use one. I also appreciate the modern stripe print. It looks pretty hot on my all black stroller (most importantly!)
i used to use the lansinoh bags only, but have found these to be cheaper and got many good reviews, so i decided to give it a try. i think the bag material is even thicker than the lansinoh ones! no problem with freezing and thawing as well. hasn't leaked at all. i haven't used it as a liner though, so i can't comment on that aspect of it.
Absolutely LOVE these.  My son latched on from the very beginning with our help by putting our finger into the hole.  I love that it doesn't obstruct his little nose.  He falls asleep sucking on these, and it keeps him calm while I prepare to feed him.  Being a breastfeeding mother, I also feel good about the natural shape of the pacifier.
After trying 8 other types of pacifiers (all of which my now 4 week old breastfed baby tearfully HATED) I desperately went looking for something truly different. I ordered these despite the cost. They just arrived an hour ago and even though she's still figuring it out, she's napping now after putting herself to sleep with it.  Thank you!!
I waited until our son was about a month old before introducing a pacifier. We tried a bunch of different brands before a lactation consultant recommended these and voila! He took it. Next time I won't hesitate to introduce these as soon as I feel that breastfeeding is off to a good start (that he has a good latch, is gaining weight, etc).
Our child isn't big on any pacifier but he's taken to these ones the best.  They don't have a top or bottom so we don't have to make sure it's in correctly which is nice at night.  They also come with plastic covers that clip right on so when it's in the diaper bag or in a pocket the part of the pacifier our son sucks on doesn't get dirty.
works pretty well. many waiters and waitresses comment how thankful they are that we attempt to keep our little ones mess to a minimum. we also get a lot of people commenting how interesting it looks.<br />i normally just shake the food off while at a restaurant and then wash it off at home and let it air dry. i think it's a great product.
i love this seat! it takes up way less space than a highchair and is conveniently portable. my 6 month old loves to be able to sit at the table with her big brother and sister; it makes her feel like one of them. it's easy to clean too! i would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants a space-saving seat that can be taken out and about.
Bought this basket as a gift for a friend who just had a baby boy.  I was able to get it delivered to her house which was wonderful because we live far from each other . It was delivered to her a few days after I ordered it and she absolutely LOVED it! I would rrecommend this product to anyone who want to give a lovely gift for newly born.
These are adorable and effective. It does a great job of keeping the binky in my son's mouth while he sleeps. He has even managed to get it in there himself a time or two. He also likes to play with it. I was so happy when I found this and even happier when it worked so well. Strangers have commented about how cute and great it is as well.
My daughter loves the wubbanub pacifier animals...they are the only pacifiers she will use.  They have saved my husband and I much time finding the dropped/hidden pacifier with the nice size stuffed animal.  They also have lasted several washings!  We especially love the giraffe but the lamb is perfect for smaller hands on your little one.
i had purchased some mam paci's for my son and within 2 weeks, he had holes in both of them at the base. when i contacted mam, they said i needed to use the diamond paci's which were designed for teethers. i had a hard time finding them in stores and was thrilled when i found them on amazon. the only negative is you can't choose the color.
i have been using this tubing for about a month now. it works perfectly and connects perfectly to my pump, the medela pump in style advanced. it is still perfectly clean...no milk in it or anything. just make sure to keep it running for a little bit after pumping to make sure all condensation is out of it. love it and can't beat the price!
My Baby loves MAM pacifiers.  I love this style of the mam paci's because you can see your babies smile.  I always hate when babies have a binky in their mouth that covers half their face.<br /><br />As for the negative reviews I have seen about mold, I haven't experienced this and that is probably because I sanitize them from time to time.
My baby has been using this since she was 2 weeks old and she likes them much better than any other pacifiers we got for our baby shower. In fact, I only got these because she would spit out everything we had. I guess these are closer to the shape of the nipples or something... I haven't tried :) But my daughter (now 2.5 months) likes them.
This pacifier was given to my daughter at the hospital. She took to it right away, and had no nipple confusion with nursing either. I'm so happy that I can buy a few more since she doesn't like the other kinds of pacifiers. You always need a couple. It's great to have something that calms a baby, and this pacifier did just that for my baby.
My son was born 5 weeks early and spent a little over 3 weeks in the NICU anf the nurse recommended getting him one of these. It is awesome! It's easier to find in the dark, he can grab it. My favorite part is you can turn it upside down and wedge it between the bassinet so it won't fall out of his mouth as easy, or tuck it in his swaddle!!
These are very similar to the kind given to our son in the hospital. He prefers this kind, and I love that since it's all one piece I don't have to worry about a choking risk from the base coming detached. They don't say on them the age range they should be used for though, so make sure you have them all gathered up before adding newer ones
This actually stays in the baby's mouth quite well. And because of it's size, it stays on the baby's chest and off the floor when he does flip it out of his mouth. Not to mention how cute it is. And the nipple part is compatible for the needs of a new born because it is more nipple shaped. I was grateful to be able to use it for my newborn.
i purchased this after my 4 month old daughter loved playing with the one at my sister's house.  it has been great.  it keeps her attention with all the different parts.  she'll chew on the antlers, the feet, the tail, etc.  this is our go-to toy when we leave the house.  he hooks easily onto our playmat or our stroller.  a good investment!
i am very impressed w/ this toy.  my 5 month old son is absolutely enthralled w/ it and he's had it for 2 months now.  he will play in it for longer than anything else we have.  he lays in it and looks up at the toys and the scenery on top.  then, when he gets bored, he rolls over and plays with the stuff on the bottom.  great entertainer!!
love these re-usable wet bags.  great size for clothes and sunblock bottle before and after swimming.  first, i have the kids wearing their swim clothes and store their clothes for after swimming in the bags.  after they are done with swimming and playing, i can store the wet clothes in the same bags, without any worry of leaking.  awesome!
this cups are awesome! however, i wish there was a way to choose between girl cups and boy cups... i have ordered them for my son twice and have gotten the most girly ones possible both times....  on the plus side, his baby sister can use them when she gets old enough so i am choosing to keep them.... still need to find some for him though.
i used a bath tub ring for my children when they were small and i loved it. they are 29 and 31 now. my granddaughter just turned one and that's why i ordered the bath tub ring. as long as you are attentive and never leave the child alone for a second, there is no problem. after all, i used it for my adult children and there wasn't a problem.
i swear by these swaddles! i started using them with my first child and was so happy to see they came in a premie size for my second. my kids have to be wrapped tight to make it through the night. i feel safe using these over a flannel blanket or muslin. they are easy to put on and stay put. i love the variety of colors and patterns as well.
my daughter is 2, she saw this and knew what to do it right away. she moves it to either one of our sinks and asks me to start the water for her. it stays steady in place (even with her on her tip toes) and it is easy to wipe clean. it is also cute, if i leave it outside the small bathroom it is fine, it does not look like misplaced clutter.
I just bought this comforter for my 20 month old son.  I was looking for something for a toddler, but also something with basketballs (he loves basketballs).  I am now trying to find a border to match it, or somewhat match it.  If anyone else has had any luck with this, please email me and let me know where you found it.  Thank you so much!!
this car seat base does what it's supposed to do - hold the carseat in place.  it's got built-in leveling bubbles to assist with proper install.  it can be installed via latch, lap belt, or shoulder/lap belt.  i've tried all 3 and had no issues.  what more can i say?  if you have a chicco keyfit or keyfit 30, this is a great additional base.
great carrier better that tne bjorn and cheaper too!  i've tried a few and i like this the best.  everyone uses this carrier the most in my family (and nanay too) becasue my daughter loves to face forward.  carrier is great for back facing too, so my daughter can fall asleep facing me.  this is the best baby carrier from a dad's perspective.
i purchased these blocks to make the learning toy found on the mama jenn blog. ([...], click on education cubes link)   basically you print out her premade inserts of letters, numbers, sight words, etc and insert them into the block instead of photos. i can use these for all kinds of learning games with all three of my homeschooling children.
the stand up potty is a bit short. however, we set it on a small step stool (a kids plastic one) and it is the perfect for height for our son. just make sure that the step stool and back side of the potty are next to a wall or cabinet so it won't fall backwards. rinses easy. i wipe it down with toilet paper after he uses it so it stays clean.
i love this stroller!  it folds/unfolds easily.  it is big enough for my 2 years old who is currently 34&#34; tall and weighs about 33 pounds.  there is still plenty of room for his head as he keeps growing.  it must be comfortable b/c he naps in it all of the time when i shop and run errands.  i wish i would have order this months earlier!!!
these were delivered in a timely fashion and in good condition.  they have served my needs well.  i use them to put in places where i normally get rashes especially in hot weather because i have areas where skin touches skin.  these absorb the moisture caused by this and the antibacterial properties probably help too:  result, no more rashes!
i feel the need to write a review here because the one star from the other review has to do with amazon's price not the great stroller. small, easy and well priced (yes, cheaper at babies r us... when can you say that?)! i give it five stars for what it is - although i will be getting the uppababy g-luxe so my baby can take naps better in it!
i got to be about 20 weeks pregnant and got this pillow - it was probably the best decision ever. especially since i was a tummy sleeping pre-pregnancy, not only did the pillow help make me sleep on my sides, but it helped make sleep comfortable for the remainder on my pregnancy. my daughter is 16 months old and i still use this pillow... lol
I have never put up wall paper before so I was a little nervous. The wall paper was easier than I thought.  Just use a lot of water and it will come out fine. It took us a little less than an hour to put up the border all around our nursery.  It looks great and matches the crib set and valances perfectly. I would highly recommend to everyone.
Bub isn't much into pacifiers it seems.  But he definitely takes this better than the round Natursutten that hits his nose.  I like this one is natural rubber and is made in one piece (not joined) like some other rubber pacifiers.  The hook fits nicely on your finger without slipping when you haven't got anywhere to pop it down straight away.
I Love these bottles i have them for about a month or so now its so easy to just put in the microwave to sterilize my baby is fully breastfed and he have no problems going from the breast to these bottles .I thought they might leak because of the holes in the bottom but they don't leak and the nipple do not get sucked in when my baby use them
My son received a WubbaNub like this as a gift when he was born. It quickly became the favorite pacifier (aka &#34;B Duck&#34; - what he calls all pacifiers now). I bought a second one as a back up just in case something happened to the original. So far he has not noticed the difference and seems to love this one just as much as the original.
Our baby girl who is almost 3 months, is able to hold her pacifier in her mouth because the WubbaNub is big enough for her to grip on to. She has enough dexterity to hold the lamb with her hands, and she is so cute squeezing it as she falls asleep. We love the WubbaNub, it's her favorite pacifier by far. I totally recommend it for your babies.
I got these for my son when he was around two months. Prior to that I had used the smaller size in Mams (Mam Start). This is the only brand our son likes, when I would give him a different brand he would just spit it out. I love the cute designs, although it says colors may vary and we were sent pink, oh well! I also got the Mam pacifier clip.
i had received a few different types of changing pads as shower gifts and these are the best!  they still look great after many washes, unlike others that look ratted and old.  i also like that they don't feel plastic like at all.  they fit the standard changing pad great!  i used to carry one around in my diaper bag for on the go changes too.
These are life-savers for us.  My Toddler has been using them since he was 6 weeks old, and has slept through the night ever since he got his first one.  Even as an infant, he could put it back in his mouth when it fell out because of the little stuffed animal on the end.  He now uses them as toys more than pacifiers and absolutely loves them.
Losing a pacifier at night is a thing of the past. My daughter goes to sleep with a binky and then spits it out. Every time she wakes up and fusses, she just wants it back to go back to sleep. These are so easy to find and hold their &#34;glow charge&#34; for a long time. It is still glowing after 7 hours after just sitting out during the day.
i love angel dear blankies and napping blankets.  i bought the giraffe napping blanket for my best friend's daughter 7 years ago and it's been passed down to her little sister and still looks and feels amazing even after 7 years of washing.  the tiger stripe blankie is just as cute and was a no brainer to buy as part of a baby shower gift set.
we've had the rails for about 2 months now and my 2 yr old has not fallen out of bed once.  because he still wets the bed at times, we have these placed under both the fitted sheet and the mattress protector.  they keep him in, but are still soft enough for him to crawl over when he's awake.  easy to travel with as well.  really great product!
this is the best thing for young parents to have for their babies. sounds gross but it works so well and no, you don't get anything back into your mouth. gently sucks out their little noses well.  my daughter and daughter in laws all love it.  can't afford to be without one in your home when you have a young one that can't blow their nose yet.
My daughter loves these.  I mean LOVES these!  If they get dirty I throw them in the wash animal and all and they have not fallen apart yet.  My daughter loves looking at them, holding them and of course putting them in her mouth.  She can find them easily in her crib at night.  I don't leave home without one.  She smiles when she sees it.  :)
My daughter has become obsessed with these! they are so great, i got her first one when she was just a few months old and I loved it for car rides so when she spat it out it would stay on her chest in case she wanted it again, I think it really helped her with hand eye coordination as well. I have the lamb, caterpillar and elephant. super cute.
These pacifiers are wonderful when you need one in the middle of the night! I was pleasantly surprised by their quick charging ability and also their ability to hold a charge for a long period of time. My son loves his MAM pacifiers and these make locating them in a dark nursery or crib much easier when trying to get a fussy baby back to sleep!
We have twin girls that are almost 2 months.  Wubbanums have been a life saver.  When one or both starts screaming, they are instantly soothed by the pacifier and because of the extra weight the stay in as opposed to other pacifiers that fall out followed by even great cries.  Of all the things we have gotten so far wubbanubs has been the best!
this was an awesome product. my daughter in law loves having it keep the baby warm. my son loves it because when he carries the seat his hand has room to move without having fabric move around. my granddaughter loves looking at the black and white design when we reverse this cover. very nicely made. shipment was quick. we all love this prodcut!
I have two little girls and these were the favorite pacifiers for both.<br />The area around the mouth seems to be smaller than that on other pacifiers, which seemed to be more comfortable for them and easier for them to hold.<br />We usually give these as gifts and have had people ask us where they can find them because their babies love them.
i ordered this for my sons graco pack and play, it fits perfectly all around. when first opened i thought it was a little stiff so i jumped on it a few times and &#34;broke it in&#34;. the mattress itself comes in a casing that repels water but with a crib mattress cover and a sheet it doesn't make noise. he sleeps thru the night now...love it!
There is something about these pacifiers that seem similar to the old Playtex pacifiers that I used for my daughters. When my daughter had my grandson, they were the only one he would take. They used to be carried by Babies R us, but for some reason they stopped carrying them, which led to a massive web search and alas, we found them on Amazon.
fits the doorway perfectly, looks great, seems very stable. my dog is a climber, but the vertical bars and lack of footholds stops him from even trying. i like that the gate opens both ways, and will close itself unless you open it all the way, at which point it stays open. perfectly-designed, in my opinion, and i'm about to order a couple more.
We've used this paci since little one was about a week old. He had colic and I was desperate and I had this one in my diaper bag from the hospital. My baby took it right away and calmed down but I was worried that he would get nipple confusion since I exclusively breastfeed him. He didn't and I don't know how I would have survived without it. :)
i bought this to replace my old diaper bag. i was looking for something more roomy and organized. this bag is perfect, it is so easy to find what you are looking for and the messenger bag style is helpful when trying to carry baby! my only complaint is that the wipes get stuck sometimes when i'm trying to pull them out, but they are still moist.
This item is great. With our first 2 kids, we were constantly losing their pacifiers. Hanging it to their clothes, with a clip was not an option for us. This allows us to easily find our baby girl's plus without having to tear the house apart. It's also light weight. We also bought the caterpillar one and found that to be a little heavy for her.
started cloth diapering at around three weeks and seven pounds. my baby still too small for full use of diaper, but with an extra fold in front these fit just fine. the diaper is wet, but the baby is not uncomfortable. we use this with the thirsties covers. i not only recommend it, but will be buying the next size up when baby outgrows size one.
this stuff is amazing!! i used it to strip diapers and it worked amazingly. so much mixed information on how to use it, so i'd research carefully depending on your machine type, number of diapers, type of issues, etc.<br /><br />once i worked out the magic combination for me, it was great!<br /><br />helped remove build up, minerals, smell, etc.
A friend bought these for me for my newborn baby girl and she loves them. They are very light-weight, which is a must for newborns. These were my daughter's first pacifiers and I tried another brand just recently and even though they were marked for 0-6 months, they were too heavy for her to hold in her mouth (she's 4 weeks old), so back to MAM!
i can't say enough about this! i was reluctant to buy not thinking it would be of any interest to my 2mo old, but let me tell you! the best investment ive made (other than diapers and the such) she absolutely loves it. i can attach it to anything! i didn't think id be able to. im buying one for my soon to be nephew :) buy it! you wont regret it!
Im bummed to see so many negative reviews for this product. This is the easiest way to take my son's temperature. Its accurate against the other thermometers we use as well. I dont use the medicine pacifier because hes always been good about taking his medicine from the dispenser from his doctor. But seriously, so much hate for a 5 star product.
we had a 30$ potty before this that had too much going on. i wanted a simple but effective product. this worked great for my boy. he enjoyed using this potty. it very simple, nothing fancy. it did it's job. also, my 3 year old was able to remove the insert and empty it himself.  for 8 bucks, i can't ask for a better product. highly recommend it!
my granddaughter loves this. it has become her favorite thing when going to bed. it is a great night light and shuts off after a while so when she goes to sleep it doesn't waste batteries. the illumination on the ceiling and walls is a nice effect with moon and stars. as it offers several colors of light it keeps it interesting for a 4 year old.
We love this pacifier! When the hospital gave us this pacifier I was unsure if I was going to be able to find it at the store. We were very pleased that we were able to get them in girl colors too! They are easy to clean and now that my daughter is getting older it is easy for her to hold on to as well. I would definitely recommend this pacifier!
this item was a necessary purchase with all of the other similar items i was needing for my new grandson's crib.  although the price was almost comparable to a new purchase retail, i ordered several similar needed items all at the same time to avoid &#34;shopping around&#34; town.  pad is soft, good quality & shipping was fast.  totally satisfied
My son loves his Wubbanuba's! The zebra is one of his favorites. He has been using them since he was about 6 weeks old and very quickly started grabbing on the animal. He learned how to put it in his mouth pretty early as well because it's so easy to grab onto the toy. He also loves chewing/sucking on the legs just as much as the pacifier itself!
My daughter refused every other pacifier until I found these.  I also use the playtex drop ins for bottles which most simulates the nipples for breastfeeding and so do these pacifiers.  My daughter has a tiny mouth and love, love, loves these!  We got a sample with the playtex bottle kit and ordered some on line asap!  Hard to find in the stores.
We got the monkey & loved him so much we just had to add the zebra to the mix! Zaire the zebra is very soft, rocks a Mohawk, contrasting colors are very stimulating and she is the perfect size & shape for a young baby to grab :) My little girl is just 12 weeks old and the paci seems too hard in density for her to suck but she loves to chew on it!
we had the newborn size and loved it so much we got the next size up when our baby outgrew the newborn size. for a baby born in the colder months this is a necessity. this provides the warmth needed for cold nights and the swaddle to control arms that can wake a baby. our baby started sleeping 12 plus hours before 2 months old. worth every penny!
My daughter loves these! She wanted nothing to do with the Philips Avent freeflow or soothie pacifiers. I purchased this pacifier after reading about it in the Moms On Call:0-6 months book. She is able to hold them in her mouth without sucking, which is great when she falls asleep with them. Amazon is the only place I have been able to find them.
Love, love, love these pacifiers!  So cute, and the stuffed animal makes it easier for babies to hold these pacifiers.  They're also much easier to keep track of than the standard variety.  Just throw them in the washing machine to clean.  Wubbanubs are so popular in my house, they've become one of my go-to baby shower gifts.  Highly recommended.

Love this and would recommend to any new parent to get for their little one.  It's perfect for traveling.  We leave it our son's carseat for any trip.. easy for him to hold onto, pick up if he drops, and doubles as a play toy!  My only negative would be the price.. you can get the same thing for about half the cost, but I really liked the dragon..
we got these on recommendation from my lactation consultant, they flow much much flower then any other bottle we tried.  now at three months my baby boy has rejected this bottle, apparently that is common to happen.  i don't blame the bottle.<br /><br />note that these are the 8oz glass bottles, not 4oz.  i didn't realize that when i bought these.
This pacifier is a life saver. My daughter, at 2 months old, is on a medication that tastes horrible. I would fight her ever time I had to give it and she would spit most of it out. Now that I have this awesome pacifier she takes every drop without any fussing or fighting. I would recommend this to anyone with little ones, truly is a life saver!!!
i bought this for my premature sons crib, it is perfect. babies should not have soft mattresses. i recieved the product on time and it had no smell to it. it is firm but not uncomfortably firm. my baby is 6 months old now and likes the mattress, it is sturdy and good construction and will last a while. i am happy i bought it and will recommend it.
i bought some hello kitty curtains from jc penny but they were not long enough so that's when i searched on amazon for the valance. it was the closes thing i saw that was similar to my curtains; hanging up, you wouldn't be able to tell that they're not the same. the color scheme of the valance is so similar to the curtains; what a perfect match!!!
i love it!! it was so easy to put together i didnt even need the manual!! i wouldnt want any other pack n play other than my graco pack n playard with newborn napper! i love the color too, it's great for a boy or girl :) they also shipped it to me within 2 days. i couldnt be more happy with this product and how well they did with shipping it to me.
love our ubbi's! purchased 2 (one for our cloth diapers and one for regular disposable). keeps smell contained and we love the modern look! our gasket popped out and we couldn't get it back in after a year of use- one email to customer service and a new ubbi was sent to our house with no questions asked. incredibly happy customers!! thank you ubbi!
i've had this for 2 months now and so far i can see my son from the screen and sleep without worrying about his safety. we switched from the summer infant monitor and i'm very glad we got this this. quality is great in day and night conditions and i would recommend this. we bought the wide angle lens and will likely be using it when he grows older.
i love this high chair. i would buy it again no questions asked. it is great as an entertainer while i do my dishes or clean up in the dinning room. plastic seat washes easily. great high adjustments as well as reclining. my daughter is 11 months old, we've been using this since she was 4 months old and she still loves it. 5 stars! also is unisex!!
I bought this (and a couple of other designs) for my niece that I will be visiting soon.  It is adorable!  I hope she loves the functionality of it as much as I'll love looking at her using it.  I really like the fact that it is machine washable.  I'm going to suggest to the Momma to either keep it in the memory box when the baby outgrows using it.

I not only love MAM pacifiers in general, but the glow in the dark are wonderful! At night my son sleeps in his pack n play next to my side of the bed. If he wakes up and is upset I can actually see his pacifier in the dark to give it back to him. Which sometimes is all he needs and will go right back to sleep. No more searching in the dark for it!
Our 7 month old hates pacifiers and never uses them :( However, this dragon wubbanub is his crib friend! He never sucks on it but he likes to mouth the stuffed animal part and hold it while falling to sleep. When he started teething he likes to chew on the pacifier part. So even though it's not used for it's intended purpose, I'm glad we bought it!
Those are really excellent pacifiers my daughter loved them and like other mothers I tried so many other pacifiers my baby wouldn't take any. Literally there is no brand of pacifiers of pacifiers I haven't used. Those are excellent and very light and soft on her face. She loves them and I love them . The shape is excellent it does not hit the nose.
My daughter has always been partial to dragons, and when I saw this for my little granddaughter, I just HAD to get it!  She chews on it, examines it, sucks on the pacifier, and bites its feet.  It's small and easily held by a less-than 6 month old who's just learning to grasp toys, and it's brightly colored and eye-catching.  Great toy for infants!
did not realize that full-sized, folding cribs were even available.  this one is very nice looking, solid and easy to fold.  it was exactly what i was looking for when my grandchildren visit.  my only slightly negative comment would be that it would have been nice to have hardware (hooks?) to hold it together when folded up.  i used a velcro strap.
I refused to use pacifiers with my oldest.  She quickly found her thumb and I have had a hard time breaking her of the habit.  When my next baby was born I turned to pacifiers to alleviate thumb sucking and the damage is does to the mouth and teeth.  These are the only pacifiers we have used.  I am constantly ordering to replace ones that are lost.
this is a great rocker. our first daughter loved it and our 2nd one is about to grow out of it so it's sturdy and well built. it's easy to clean too. the vibrations amused the first baby but not so much with the 2nd one, so mileage may vary. i only wished it had a bit more padding along the top rim, it's kinda hard and it can hurt when bumped into.
love this product! it fits perfectly with my medela pump parts so i can pump directly into the avent natural bottles. the only bottles my daughter will take. no leakage-i've only used it with the sealing ring though. and for those of you with a hygeia pump-you can use the medela flange ect and just use the hygeia tubes and use this product as well!
Not only is it adorable but my daughter loves it. Its her friend as well as a soother. I have sewn new binkies on it when our dog ate it off and we have never lost this. I'm buying this as a shower gift for every shower I go too! The best part is they go with any theme and when its time to say goodbye to the binky they can keep their friend forever!
the sleepy wrap is far more breathable and comfortable than most other baby carriers. the generous amount of stretchy fabric that envelops the baby gives boths the wearer and the baby more of a feeling of security. the sleepy wrap shapes to the baby's position, rather than the other way around. it's just a stylish, east to wear, comfy baby carrier !
would purchase again. very nice looking and blends well with hard wood floor and furniture, unlike plastic baby stuff. my toddler also uses it for a seat (she automatically sat on it when she first saw it and it was perfect for that purpose), and it's a bit too short to help her reach much right now so it will do double duty and a bench and a stool.
i was hoping this organizer would work well for my freezer. it works better than i could have hoped for. i use the medela bags and they fit just fine in this organizer. the only thing is i wished it had one more plastic separator for between the bags, since i come home from work with 3 bags to freeze. i love how the lid flips over for extra storage.
These binky's are a god send for my son! He only uses a pacifier to relax himself to sleep and in his car seat! These little guys stay in his mouth better than traditional pacifiers, and my little one loves to squeeze and cuddle the soft toy, its comforting for him! This little lamb is for my niece, I hope she is as helpful as my sons wubbanubs are!
these bags are awesome. i keep them on the changing table and use them for soiled diapers. i used to use the diaper genie, but i hated leaving smelly diapers in the room until the container was filled. this way i just throw the diapers away as they are used.  i also keep them in my diaper bag. i've used them numerous times for wet or dirty clothes馃槈
i was preparing to return to work, and my ebf 5 month old was having trouble with every bottle that we tried. finally, we tried sippy cups.  this one was the best because it has a soft spout.  also, it only holds 5 oz, which is about the amount my daughter eats at each sitting.  the smaller size means that the amount tips into her mouth more easily.
My daughter loves these pacifiers - they do not push against her nose and have a perfect texture (both soft/gummy and firm). They are easy to clean as I just throw them on the top rack of the dishwasher. I also like that the nipple part is hollow - you can easily put your finger in it to ensure a crying baby doesn't spit the pacifier out right away.
we had owned the city mini single in 2011, and three children later upgraded to this bad boy. we adore this stroller. it fits our 3 1/2 year old and 2 year old on one side sitting together so it's plenty deep. easy to navigate, a little harder to close up compared to the single city mini, but still easier than every other stroller. highly recommend!
I had this set on my baby registry at target but it sold out :( so I found the gift set on amazon & ordered it immediately, it's prettier in person exactly what I was looking for since I want my baby to have all MAM bottles & pacifiers. I love how everything is broken down into pieces, easier to clean. Can't wait until my baby's here to use them! ;)
My son loves his WubbaNubs!  We have the frog and the monkey and he has used them since he was only a few weeks old.  Having the animal attached to the pacifier has really helped us keep track of the pacifier (we haven't spent lots of money on lost binkies).  We get lots of compliments of this and it's a lot cheaper here on Amazon than in the store.
These are the greatest things!! My son loves his binky and so having a big animal on the other end helps him from dropping it on the floor and makes it easy for him to pick up and put in his mouth on his own. I put it in his crib at night and he can pick it up and put it right in his mouth. I had to buy two of these things because they are so great!
I like this pacifier holder because its large enough to fit 2-3 pacifiers in it and it's great that it can be attached to the outside of the diaper bag for convenience. I really love the Mixed Leaf design as well. I purchased many JJ Cole items for my new baby and I really like all the items I have. They are high quality and very attractive designs!
i have purchased a total of 4 of these sheets for my daughter's pack n play. the sheet pulls out flat so that you do not have to be concerned with the baby smothering if they sleep on there stomach. it fits perfectly over the pack n play mattress. my baby sleeps comfortably each night. only complaint is there are not very many color or pattern optio
love sophie and that she isn't made with sketchy chemicals. i do wish my kid was more interested in her right now, but at 6 months she still gravitates towards things with louder primary colors that have attachments that fit in her tiny mouth a bit better. assuming as she gets a bit older and more confident in her grasp sophie will become a favorite.
i have my son's room as a frog-theme and this fits in perfectly. for &#60; $10, i thought it would be cheaply-made, but the support rods are actually quite sturdy and do a great job at keeping the product from &#34;deflating&#34; or sinking into itself. it has nice handles on the side as well, so it's easy to transport in and out of the laundry room.
awesome bag .. the way it's made the print the pockets the two zip pockets very roomy inside magnetic closures are very strong very pleased with that ..... it's a great looking bag i'm using it this week to take on my trip to the uk as my purse it just doesn't have to be a diaper bag it can be your momma bag it looks that stylish<br />lovin it !!!!!!
we have a strange stairs that go down in the middle of our living room with a banister and 1/2 wall. No gate would work so we ended up using these gates and extensions to make our living room into a play pen. The baby can roll and crawl without being able to leave the living room. This is working for us better then trying to just gate off the stairs.
My daughter is 10 months old and she never really liked pacifiers. A friend came over with her son, born a week after my daughter, he was wearing a pacifier. Of course my daughter got curious and grabbed his pacifier and put it in her mouth and loved it ever since. I thought these were age appropriate since she knows how to suck a straw. Love them!!!
We love using these pacifiers! They are sturdy, easy to wash, and BPA free! One thing I really like about Phillips AVENT is that they come with convenient cover, which is EXCELLENT when you are putting the pacifier in your bag or pocket so it doesn't get dirty. And the biggest plus is that our little one really likes to use it and it makes him happy.
I bought this pacifier for my son before he was born. I took it with me to the hospital when I went into labor. The child was attached to it as soon we offered it to him. It's easy to find and you can just throw it in the washer. I ordered him similar ones it but he prefers this on.  He's four and half months now and this is the second one I buy him.
this diaper bag is small but cute. looks like it will fit extra clothes, a couple bottles, diapers, wipes and a couple of pacifiers with room left over. will be good for short outings with baby. comes with a cute, color coordinated diaper changer. you can't beat the price. very pleased with this purchase and can't wait to use it when my baby arrives!
We purchased two of these while our twin daughters were still in the NICU and we love them! They are now 4 months old and we have yet to use or purchase any other pacifiers. Easy to clean off with hot water and/or a mesh laundry bag. They are the perfect weight, not too heavy, but just enough to keep them in place. Really soft and cute in person too!
love these things. they have been a lifesaver. these are so sturdy and aft enough for our kiddo's patootie. they easily contain solids and are flush able so we don't have to use the diaper sprayer that much which is a horrible activity. they also don't bunch up in the diaper like most other liners we've tried and i believe it's due to it's sturdiness.
These pacifiers are the best! The soothie type we got in the hospital works all right, but our son likes these ones better. They're cute, they resemble a real nipple so they don't interfere with breastfeeding, and the fact that there's no up or down is really nice too. They're also comfortable for his little face. I've yet to find a downside to these!
My daughter loves her Buddy as she calls it! We never leave home without him! This is actually one I bought For my second daughter because my first loves hers so much! She had seen my daughter's and asked about it for her newborn. I highly recommend these! They're cute and pretty easy to keep up with! My daughter likes to rub hers as she falls asleep.
My first baby didn't like pacifers so the second time around I didn't give them much thought. I put these on my wish list as an after thought. Boy was I wrong about that. These might be the number one used baby product in our house (besides maybe mybreastfriend feeding pillow, that thing is magic!). I'm super glad I thought to add them to my registry.
I have bought 2-3 of these for both my girls. I absolutely LOVE them and so do my girls. Easy to wash, they're easier to find so I'm never frantically searching for it, and the animal makes it easy for the girls to grab them and put it in their mouth. Not to mention they love cuddling with it :) very durable as well. The first one lasted about a year!
My wife bought this after hearing a couple people talk about them on Facebook.  I had my doubts, as to why we needed this.  But it really does help our 3 month old sleep better.  When the pacifier pops out of his mouth, it usually gets lost.  This doll helps to keep it  in his mouth because it rests on his chest. He spits it out much less than before.
after shopping around town i noticed finding a black crib was hard. i checked online and i found this crib. i fell in love. when it arrived my husband and i set it up. i loved it even more. when family and friends walk into the nursery they always ask about the crib and talk about how strong it is compared to their cribs. i'm so glad i pick this crib.
This is the only pacifier my son would take and we now own so many of them. They are light and easy for newborns and young babies to hold onto, but haven't caused any nipple confusion. The design is really thoughtful and we'd recommend this to any new parent--although each kid is different, these seem to be really especially made for the younger ones.
These are wonderful.  Pacifiers go everywhere in my house.  I know have at least 10, but I could never find one when I needed it until we bought a few of these.  My son likes to hold onto the animal, and the weight of the animal helps him keep the pacifier in his mouth, especially in the car-seat.  Just don't let your baby have one of these for sleep!
My grandson has this same monkey as his favorite stuffed animal except this is smaller.  When I found this Monkey Wubbanub on amazon, I had to get it for him.  He loves it!  It is so nice to have a pacifier attached to something.  It is rarely on the floor.  I bought this for him when he was 3 months old and he's 51/2 months now and he still loves it!
This is a lot easier for my son to learn than a sipping cup.  It took him 30 seconds to learn how to use a straw, which is totally amazing for me.  The straw inside can be detached easily for cleaning.  There is not many hard to reach places where I cannot clean in case of mold growth.  My son has been chewing on the straw but there is no teeth marks.
My sister purchased one like this and gifted it to me at my baby shower. Anytime my son sported it, he got endless comments on how edgy & cute it was. It became my son's go-to pacifier. I decided to order another one myself due to his old one wearing out. Shipping on this item was fast. Looking forward to gift a couple of these at future baby showers.
i'm a first time mom and my daughter recently got sick for the first time. she is only two months old and trying to use a bulb syringe was horrible for both of us. the snotsucker is wonderful. she cried the first time we used it but since then she's gotten used to it. no more cries and she even smiles once we get done. it really helps her feel better.
Switched from the Soothies to these, with better results. My middle son loved the Soothies until he was about 6 months old, but my youngest kept spitting them out as newborn. They were too heavy for him. We switched to the lighter Freeflow pacis and they work great for him. Sometimes with pacifiers you have to keep trying until you find one baby likes.
This is a great price on these soothies. My son has loved them since he was quite little. He's nearly done with them as he gets closer to age 2, but at nighttime they're still a hit! They work well with any pacifier clip too, which is great for daycare. Easy to clean and durable. He prefers these to any others including fancier and more expensive ones.
these are light-weight and great as our place gets steaming hot the closer it gets  to summer. we were also looking for something to swaddle our 6 month old in that was easier to break out of when he wants to than the strong velcro type so we can transition out of the swaddle entirely. would have loved the 4th blanket to not just be plain white though.
there are the cheap car seats and then you have the heavy ones like diono - for my kids, i would not trust anything less than diono since the car seats need to hold safe.  * the car set is very comfortable for kids - compared to a cosco they had earlier * if you have a compact car - this will occupy a considerable space on your back seats * it is heavy
I bought this one for a baby gift but we have had several in our household. It is great for newborns, just lay it on the baby's chest and if it slips out of her mouth, the pacifier is right there and often the baby can root for it and get it back without an adult looking all over the place for it! The animals are cute and washable. Fantastic invention!
My daughter has really chubby cheeks. As an infant, the sides of paci's would almost cut into her cheeks. But these particular pacis don't. They curve away from the face a bit. So much more comfortable. They leave NO lines on her face. These are the only pacis that I've found that curve away. The clear color is hard to find once dropped. So stock up!!!
My beautiful baby girl eschews all other pacifier brands/models except for these ones.  These are well-designed with an indentation for you to hold it with your finger (and your baby can feel your finger) and to keep it in their mouth.  The lip of the pacifier is also useful for parents to hold the pacifier in their mouth and keep their two hands free.
The only binki for my babe, it soothes and it works, others that boast of being a similar shape to a nipple have not worked for him and because they are 2 pieces vs 1 solid piece they seem to get lint and randomness trapped at the seem of the nipple and the face with the flap....which as a new mom, who likes things clean and sanitary, I'm not a fan of.
I previously bought others from the Serta site.  They no longer carry them, but thank goodness Amazon does!  This one is smaller than the normal ones, and has a pacifier in its mouth, so is perfect for the newborn.  It was my daughters favorite shower gift.  Amazon also has others, and they are all equally as cute, soft, cuddly, and ones they will keep.
I researched what was the best pacifier for the nursing baby.  This product came highly recommended, I agree.  This was the only pacifier my nursing baby would take.  My only complaint is that it collects dust and other stuff so you will need to wipe it periodically.  The tab sticking out did not seem to bother my sleeping baby.  She loves her pacifier.
I bought this because of its great reviews and was not disappointed.  It's easy to use and beats several little squirts of medicine that inevitably come out of her mouth.  It can bee kind of hard to close, but once you figure it out, it's not so bad.  Medicine can come out a little fast...  Haven't tried with the syringe yet...  My baby is 12 weeks old.
Really, every bathtub area should have them, just in case.  They are cheap, very strong, and secure solidly to any clean ceramic or smooth non-porous surface.  They are easy to remove and leave no marks.  When you get it, be sure your tile has been installed correctly.  Mine easily supports 100 plus pounds.  Remember you need it before you slip or fall.
I bought this as a little treat for my daughter, who is due in June, I'm sure she will love it.  This item is just as cute in person as on the web.  At first I thought it was smaller than anticipated, but that has more to do with me skipping over the measurement description than any real issue.<br />My husband is excited too, who doesn't love dragons???
My daughter loves her 'Monk Monk'!! He goes everywhere with us! It really helps that she can hold onto it and play with the stuffed animal while she's 'pacify-ing.' It is also more convenient for me to find 'Monk Monk' in her diaper bag, all the other pacifiers fall to the bottom and I constantly have to dig to find them.  You should definitely get one!
based on the reviews, we bought this toy before our daughter was born.  from 1-3 months, she didn't have much use for it.   but, for the last four months, she has really enjoyed this toy giraffe.  it is a small, convenient toy that she can gnaw on and play while on the go.  also, i like the fact that it is made of natural materials.  highly recommended!
My baby loves this pacifier. It is very thin across the gum line and has a nice size for the bulb. She's had other MAM pacifiers and this is her favorite. I like the design of the plastic outer part as it allows for good airflow. I would recommend this pacifier - especially parents who use MAM bottles. The MAM perfect pacifier has a truly unique design.
one word: amazing!  i swaddled my daughter from day 1 and she has always slept wonderfully.  anytime i wouldn't swaddle her, she would sleep for half the time.  this particular swaddle is nice because the velcro on the flap would stick wherever you stretched it to.  my daughter was on the smaller side, so that made it much easier to get a good snug fit!
my 3 month old daughter received this from my mom for christmas. we put her on it for the first time tonight and she loves it! the songs are each unique from each other and my baby was kicking the piano keys within 10 seconds! i like that it can change with her as she grows. she can use it for tummy time and later for playing the piano. plus, it's cute!
i highly recommend these potty seat covers. they completely cover the toilet seat and have an extra long front to keep kids legs from touching the bowl. they also stay in place on the seat. i have tried other seat covers and they fall off before i can even get my daughter on the seat. this product is an absolute must have for potty training and after!!!
These pacifier wipes are great.  We initially received as a shower gift and bought more when we ran out.  They are great for cleaning a pacifier that was either dropped on the ground, thrown in a diaper bag with other stuff, etc.  The smell is very pleasant, not harsh or alcohol-smelling, safe for baby to immediately use after wiping.  Highly recommend!
We lover these binkys.  Our son has used sever different ones but we found that other brands can get water in the nipple when washed and I always fear there will be bacteria that grows.  These are great and very cute.  Our son is 11 months so we will be retiring these soon but we have another baby due in April and plan to start using MAM from the start.

we bought this changing pad so we could change our baby's diaper in her bassinet without worrying about getting a mess on the sheets or mattress.  this pad folds up for easy storage, yet it's got a bit of padding to it.  it's a great size - small enough to fold up but large enough to go under the whole baby.  it's easy to clean - we just use a baby wipe.
I always keep a pack of these in my diaper bag.  They're great for when my son drops his pacifier or teether, and also for when my daughter's sippy needs a quick wipe-down while we're out and about.  I've actually even wiped down my breast pump with these and put the pump parts in the fridge until the next use when I didn't have access to a bottle brush.
i was devestated when i couldn't produce enough breast milk and making bottles at midnight wasn't very much fun. we decided to splurge with a gift card and get this. it is a luxury, not a necessity, but it saves a lot of time and it really is as easy as pushing a button and bam, bottle done in 5 seconds. we haven't had any problems with it after a month.
The stuffed animal gives my son something easy to hold on to.  Lately he has been gumming the dragon about as much as sucking on the pacifier, but it keeps him calm so that is all that matters.  To clean it, we run it through the clothes washer and hang dry it.  It is well made.  If your child likes soothies, they probably will like this dragon WubbaNub.
Best pacifier ever! My son finally slept through the night with this pacifier ( and I tried A LOT of pacifiers). The glow in the dark are a must have for bed time. He can find his pacifier in the dark and can reinsert it without me having to get out of bed. Its also great when you have to go in for the dream feed to find them without turing on the light.
I haven't actually used these pacifiers yet, as my son is 8 months old, but I'm sure I'll be opening them up soon. He loved the younger stage ones, and has been using them a lot. I like the feel and he enjoys playing with and moving them around. I also like that these are pretty easy to clean and keep track of. (I received a package for review purposes.)
love this organizer!  i use it on my stroller but the adjustable straps make it a perfect fit for the back of a car seat or even the handlebars of a bike.  i actually use this organizer to keep my wallet, keys and phone close as well as baby's needs while i'm shopping.  so much easier than digging through my purse or the diaper bag when i need something!
Bought this as a gift for my niece. She is older (in first grade), but has seizure disorder triggered by stress and sucking on a pacifier helps calm her down and prevent seizing. This plushie helps her &#34;normalize&#34; having the binkie and is helping her learn to use the plushie to calm down instead of the binkie. She loves the pattern and color too.
Baby loves these things, but so does the dog. Just means we need to order more I guess. The nipple will invert slightly as well so when you are trying to ween baby off of the soother you can do that, and then after a while cut the stuffed animal off the soother part. Baby isn't old enough for that for me yet, but I'm looking forward to see if that works!
While I could never get my son to take a pacifier, this one was the only one he would take (or just chew on). It travels well and despite being thrown all over the place for the last six months, it looks brand new still.<br /><br />I love how my son was able to hold onto the giraffe and chewed on the pacifier. It almost served as a lovey for a long time.
great gate has held up very well, easy enough for the older children to open but not the younger ones. is not a gate you want to take down everyday, i just use velcro to hold it open after daycare hours.  if you take it down each time you have to square it up when you put it back up. very sturdy and nice looking, have got alot of compliments on this gate.
I adore these and so does my little guy. So much more attractive than so many of the other options out there! I get a ton of compliments on them when out with my son and feel good knowing I'm giving him the best. We have a couple of soothies too but multiple times I've seen him gag with those where as the more natural shape of these seems to prevent that.
My baby loves these pacifiers. They are safe and everyone always asks where we got them. I had previously used the Gerber kind with the blue, pink, or white plastic piece. Those were the only kind she would use, BUT she only wanted the larger size and apparently they stopped Making those so I went on a hint for a replacement and these worked like a charm!
this calendar gives you a format to write daily notes about what's happening with your little one. there's a monthly page to write baby's likes/dislikes, milestones etc. also spots for monthly pics and a page to write the family tree + background and letters from mommy and daddy. cute illustrations and stickers to mark milestone (1st smile, sits up etc.).
i am an exclusive pumper and i attempt to switch out the valves every 6-8 weeks and the membranes every 3-4 weeks to help with suction and production.  i have found that it is not always enough to just switch membranes as the valves will get loose from cleaning, effecting suction.  this is a perfect set of valves and membranes for my replacement schedule.
This monitor my husband and I purchased after trying several others and returning them. We love this one cause you can watch everything the little one is doing. Its absolutly awesome. We have cordless phones and dsl and doesnt really interfere. Its the best monitor out there. You can walk around with it too! Its handheld. Its nice sized and great quality.
my little granddaughter just loves this walker.  i chose this one because she is little for her age and i read a review that said it was a bit short for most babies.  it fits her perfectly! it's sturdy, was easy to put together, easy to clean and folds up easily for transport. the only thing i noticed was the wheels don't work easily when going backwards.
My son just hit 4 months. He's been teething up a storm. He always trys to chew on the sides of his paci so this is perfect. His paci with more teething space! I popped that puppy out of the package and right away he was interested in it. I can't believe how expensive some teethers are. This is simple and cute. It looks great with the soothie paci holder.
loved this when my baby wasn't too mobile. he was 6 lbs when we first used this, we had to wrap it more and had troubles till he was a little bigger. when he was the perfect size he was too strong for this swaddle. i still loved it and would recommend using as soon as possible. my baby loved being swaddled, even now an then at 9 months it helps him sleep.
My little one loves his wubbanub!<br />It was so perfect when he was an infant because you can lay the animal on their chest and the paci wont fall out of their mouth when they stop sucking like other pacis so you don't have to put it back in their mouth 10 times in the middle of the night.<br />Now that he older he carries it around and its hard to lose.
bought these for my daughter because they were not only adorable but they are GREAT at night because they usually stayed on her chest when the paci fell out.  Even if it fell to the side of her, they are so easy to find in the middle of the night when you're half asleep!!!  also thought they would be great for her to hold onto when she gets a little older
My 9 month old sleeps with one Wubbanub in her mouth, and one in each hand. I keep a stash of them in my car so I can easily pop a new one back over to her when she chucks it out of her carseat. The monkey is my favorite because it's dark colored - makes it easy for her to see it on her white bed sheet in the middle of the night so she can pop it back in.
a very useful device to keep my eyes on my 80 yr old father who is mobility challanged. this monitor not only works for babies, but is a great tool for the elderly! he's a bit frustrated on the lack of privacy... but i convinced him that his safety was our primary concern and he can cover the camera lens anytime he wants. he doesn't like it, but i love it!
great product. i originally brought the blue whale by muchkin but every time i turned my faucet on it kept falling off. i read the reviews on this product and decided to buy it. you really have to push it on because it is a snug fit. it fits perfect on my faucet because i have my shower switch higher. i love this product, going to get it for my other home.
Love these. Best paci. Every child is different so you have to find what works for them. My daughter was breastfeed so this shape being most like the breast worked for her, Iv tried the gumdrops by this brand which supposed to be the same but she wont touch them. I also got a different brand just like this and she spit them out. Babies know what they like.
this is a great baby monitor for the price.  we were looking to purchase a video monitor since our daughter began climbing out of her crib.  my sister in-law recommended this model, and we decided to give it a shot.  it is very easy to set-up and use.  i can even bring this camera outside when i'm in the yard, and it keeps its signal.  definitely a keeper!
We three types of pacifiers for our new baby girl and started introducing them to her when she was about 4 weeks old.  The Soothies are by far her favorite.  We also tried some of the Nuk which she is sort of okay with and another Avent which she spits out every time.  We have now bought multiple packages of the Soothies and we're all very happy with them.
Quality material, matches the leather in my new Ford Explorer beautifully, and I am no longer standing on my head on the floor of my vehicle to retrieve the items that I used to lose beside the seat!  Loved this product so much I bought a set for each of my kid's cars.  You don't even notice they are there, until something drops, and then you are thankful!
the side zipper can be somewhat awkward to zip and unzip but otherwise this is a perfect hoodie! i have been wearing it in addition to my winter coat here in chicago, makes me feel like baby stays warmer since i don't have a coat big enough to zip around her. i know this will be perfect on it's own on the cooler spring and fall days too. worth every penny!
Gave this to my granddaughter for Christmas along with a copy of a Noah's Ark book.  She is Just beginning to walk and almost one-year-old.  The Ark is solid with wood cut-outs in the shape of animals and Noah's family and the child must learn to place the proper shape into the right hole.  So cute toy to teach sorting and Noah's place in Biblical history.
this is an absolute potty training must have! our toddler has just begun the potty training process and had been doing well at home. the only problem we had was when we were out an about. this solved the problem! now we have to make sure it stays in the vehicle! the product is nicely constructed and the handle allows our toddler to carry it to the vehicle.
My daughter loves these pacifiers,  I can't say I prefer them since I just bought a few options and she likes these the best.  She has a hard time getting it in her mouth which is frustrating for me to watch.  I'm not sure why the free flow ones are different,  the regular ones hit my daughters nose every time she sucks,  not sure why they still sell them.
i own a drywall company and this product does exactly what it says it will do. i've used it for several years. yes, it's pricey but the end result is worth it. just a tip-cut/bed the edges once it's in place and has dried in. it is not necessary to fill the actual crease, just the edges. i adjust my price a bit when using this on jobs with vaulted ceilings.
the babies in my sunday school class love this toy. they actually fight over the balls that come with it, so it's great that it comes with 3 of them. they don't get bored of it like other reviewers babies, but that might be because they only get to play with it once or twice a week. i would definitely recommend it for a daycare/sunday school setting though.
We have been very pleased with all Dr. Brown's products. We have their bottles, bottle warmer, pacifiers, and more. With our second child on the way we decided to stick with what we were used to and happy with. My daughter is 15 months and only uses the Dr. Brown's pacifiers when she is napping or sleeping, never had an issue with her not liking this brand.
This pair was a hit! I got them as decorations on a dipper cake for the  dad to be Huggies and Chuggies party. The guys thought it was so cool and the new mom to be thinks its just to funny and cute. They came in a plastic flip bag together so it was def a good choice to put on the cake. I would not want to give it in that bag. Just not a good presentation.
frankly, although this is marketed as a child's nightlight, i wouldn't mind having one myself.  bought for all my grandsons (4 in two states), and they cannot go to bed without it, for a few years now.  it really makes the ceiling splendiferous.  they can choose a different color each night.  i would have to say that no child should be without one.  period.
this blanket is so cute! it's a mix of polyester, silk, satin and really soft! it has little loops or &#34;taggies&#34; on the blanket that allow you to attach it to wherever you want. the puppy wearing the santa hat is darling and will look so cute in pictures. i bought this for my newborn nephew and i can't wait to see him cuddled up with it on christmas.
i could not sleep at night without this monitor!  it's an amazing invention!  i rest easy knowing my son is safe in his bed.  it has gone off before because of extremely light breathing, but it's still worth it!  i would rather get scared a couple of times and it be nothing then wake up and it be something...  thank you for having it at an affordable price!
bought this for my niece and she absolutely loves it.  we noticed the elephant was a little wound up too tight as it would snap at a very fast velocity.  the remedy was to let up on some of the tension by pulling up on the elephant and twisting it s few times to relieve some of the tension.  problem solved and no longer a hazard, much to my niece's delight.
We got this lamb as a gift when my daughter was born.  She started sleeping with &#34;Winky,&#34; as we still call him, when she was seven months old.  Now she is 4 1/2 and he is still her favorite thing to sleep and snuggle with.  The lamb gets a LOT of love and has held up wonderfully!  This purchase was made so that she would have one to keep at daycare.
Twins were born at 26 weeks and the round gum drops pacis from the hospital were the only ones they would take.  The dentist hated the round gumdrops, but then I found these and dentist and babies approved.  Success!!  I also love that the pacifiers do not get water and soap stuck in the nipple when they are being washed since the nipple has an open design.
it was very useful on our trip. it inflates and deflates quickly. it does smell like plastic but that is to be expected, it was not overwhelming by any means. crib sheets fit well. our daughter is 2 1/2 years old and about 40 inches tall and this fits her perfectly. easy to carry, inflate, deflate and fold up which we had to do at least 5 times on our trip.
this was the best thing i ever found. i tried to get my boy to take a pacifier (for when i went back to work) but he wouldnt take anything until we found this and were able to teach him how to use the pacifier by sticking our finger in it. he wont use anything else. only down side is that most pacifier clips and covers do not work with this kind of pacifier.
this stroller is worth the money. no need to get a expensive stroller  with different seats that attach to the same frame. this is all in one.  converts to a pram and will lay flat.  it's easy to entertain my 7 month old in this stroller while we are at all day sport meets for my older son.  i recommended this to a friend and she loves it too. great product.
we just ordered this crib set for our baby.  we do not know if we are having a boy or a girl so this is what my husband and i agreed on for an 'either gender!'  for the price we are very pleased with this purchase! it comes in a nice bag and the ten pieces surprised me!  the bed quilt is very soft and feels so nice after we washed it! i really love this set!
We tried this pacifier out after trying many different ones. This is the only pacifier my little one will ( kind of) take! She doesn't like pacifiers and tends to gag with most of them, but she will occasionally take these in the car when she's starting to get fussy. The nipple on these seems smaller than others we've tried so I'm assuming that's the reason.
this is the most valuable item the 'new parents' must have on their survival kit.<br />it's a perfect stroller... it's very strong, big, light weight, and keep very small when it closes.<br />and it's not simple like a poor 'umbrella' model... it more than that. and it's easy to open and close it with only one hand.<br />to sum up... it's a perfect stroller !
This is the best pacifier out there for breastfed babies or babies who will only take the one from the hospital. My son wouldn't take any other pacifier but the one from the hospital. I tried every kind. This pacifier is amazing because it creates a sucking motion like that during breastfeeding. I buy them in bulk! I would not use any other kind for my child.
Pacifiers can be so boring, right?  If you want to add some `funny' to you and your child's day as well as getting plenty of smiles and laughs, you have to check out the Stachifier.  Geared for babies and toddlers between the ages of 6-36 months, the Stachifier is a natural orthodontic shaped silicone pacifier that is BPA free.  Did I mention it is HILARIOUS?
This is the first soother that my daughter ever used. Just the right size for newborn baby's mouth! Plus, only weeks after she was born, she was able to hold onto it herself because of the attached teddy! She grew out of it by 3 months of age though as the spout/knob part that goes into baby's mouth was too small and/or just wasn't a comfortable suck anymore.
my second daughter would not take the avent pacifiers that my first daughter liked so much.  she was very colicky and this was the only pacifier that would soothe her.  i highly recommend it, just check them often when your children start getting teeth, as they might chew on the pacifier and the nipple could be chewed off.  still worth buying many of them!!!!
I currently had the WubbaNub Monkey and do not leave home without it. Do to problem with my sons lower jaw he was not able to breast feed. But he still likes to suck. This has been a life saver already and will continue to come in handy. before receiving these products I was totally anti pacifier. However this product also works as a security blanket as well.
We bought this item when we were tired of carrying our travel system around.  It is lightweight, folds like an umbrella stroller and is very sturdy.  I love the basket underneath.  My friends are all wanting one once they saw mine!  It is a little more than your average umbrella stroller, but I think it is well worth the extra money.  You get what you pay for!
i bought this book for use at our house when our little 10 month old great granddaughter comes over for a visit.  i have pictures of her with her dad and mom and our two pet dogs.  she loves the photo book and carries it around with her.  it is just the right size.  i like it because the pictures don't come out easily and the book wipes off to look good as new
i have been through so many different shaker bottles, and they all get broken or chipped quickly from me dropping them especially the cheap gnc ones. these bottles are tuff, i have dropped them several times when full and they have not broken. the extra compartments are really convenient too, i use them to hold my protein. if you need a shaker this is the one.
The mattress that came with our pack'n'play is horrible and extremely hard. We bought this to use, and love it. My 18 month old sleeps on it every night. It works well with the pack'n'play sheets and wet pads we already had. It's a little unwieldy when we have to bring it somewhere, but it's better than him sleeping on something that feels like hard cardboard.
my mom used the pillow and knitted a cover for it along with a blanket for the crib. the pillow is so soft and it's just the right size. the pillow is quality constructed and should last quite a while. chris from the company even inquired about the purchase to see if everything was alright. i appreciate that extra attention and it shows that they care. thanks!
my daughter loves these shapes and letters. good bath fun. quality and durable for biters and chewers. they rinse well and &#34;stick&#34; to walls and your child because of the water suction, which makes and additional activity for your child to enjoy putting them all over the tub. for myself, it was a way to get my daughter to like bath time again. good toy!
my daughter just love teething blanket i'm trying to buy her different kinds... this one serves its purpose. i received neither one in the photos... i got a green teething blanket embroidered with one bee and yes only two teething corners. it really varies in color and design but it doesn't matter as long as my 6 mo. old daughter appreciates what i get for her.
These pacis work great for a newborn.  The nipple is larger at the end which makes it easier for the little ones to keep in their mouths.  We tried the Soothie kind and without the bulge at the end, it is harder for our baby to keep it in his mouth.  We also tried the NUK brand, but those have a right side up whereas these can be put in baby's mouth either way.
Wasn't sure I could get these anywhere, but was so happy to see them online, since the one that she got when she was born was almost MIA yesterday and that can be a problem with an infant.  So stocked up on these and love the different colors. only downside is that everything gets stuck to the material the paci is made of, so constantly washing off fuzzies/hair
This is a great crib for the price.  There are 3 height adjustments, but you do have to remove the mattress (mattress not included) and take out the bolts with nuts on each corner to be able to change the height.  We just set ours to the lowest adjustment for a 1 year old which has worked out just fine.  The crib is very sturdy and feels very safe for the baby.
My son was a little fussy for the first 2 1/2 months.  About 3 weeks after birth I tried many different pacifiers.  The soothie wasn't my first choice because I thought it looked weird.  Eventually I gave in and bought it and my son loved it.  Once he hit 3 months he no longer wanted a pacifier and he is a happy baby.  I would definitely recommend this product.
i love the one piece design (much better then the original two part one) and the size is perfect for me.  because this is designed a bit differently then the original too, i feel like i worry about the milk getting in the tubes less.  you will still get moisture build up, but that's expected and i just let it blow off after every pump.  i really love this item.
Pirate stuff is awesome no matter what, when I saw this I really wanted one for my newborn son, and ordered it right away, then when it arrived I was surprised how big the skull was on the other side and relized that he would need to be 6+ months before he could hold the weight of this thing!! Either way I thought it was still adorable and can't wait to use it.
this fleece sleep sack is a great weight for the cooler months. it is very soft and luxurious feeling and i love the pink and white &#34;puppytooth&#34; pattern. it fits my average size 8 month old (she is 28in and 17lbs) with some room to grow, though i don't think it will fit at 12 months. it washes well and seems like a high quality product, worth the price!
Coming home from the hospital I was wondering how easy it would be to find the same pacifier they use there. My first child would not take his pacifier at all. I ran across these on Amazon that looked like they matched what we were given in the hospital and they do match up perfectly. Our second loves his pacifier and these things seem to keep him pretty happy!
We loved your product and it's use has brought many smiles to friends who have seen his picture.  It's a cute idea and any time you can make people smile with so little effort, well I think you should. He had no trouble adapting to this pacifier and he was already using one, so it's not like we forced him to use something he didn't need. Thanks for the product.
We were running low on pacifiers, so decided to try out a new style.  Our daughter is 4 months old, and she is hooked on these.  Unlike the other ones we've used (soothies), she never spits this one out, even when we pick her up or carry her.  It also seems that the design gives her more freedom to breathe than other pacifiers.  Whatever it is, she loves these!
These are the real deal GumDrops from Hawaii Medical. These are the only pacifiers that our two sons would take. Beware of other products called GumDrops, but not made by Hawaii Medical -- these here are slightly firmer and hold up well over time. We like the GumDrops over the green Soothies (from the same company) given the nose cut-out at the top of the paci.
i bought these bowls after trying about 5 other kinds of \\stay put\\ suction bowls.  these are the only ones that have actually stayed put on his high chair, the table, and even restaurant tables!  we went out and bought another pack, so we now have 6.  my 1-year-old pulls and pulls and pulls on these, but cannot break the suction -- a great deal for the money!
i was scared all my little guys toys wouldn't fit in this but they do! when i first saw the size of the mesh netting i was worried. we used to store his toys in a medium size sand pale and we can fit all of them and more! suction devices work phenomenally. i've been using it for over 2 months now and they are yet to fall.  no moldy smells are slimy toys anymore!
My son loves these.<br />We always had problems losing the pacifiers, until we found these.<br />They also help with hand-eye co-ordination. He learned at a very young age how to put the paci back in his mouth, also it was so much easier for him to find his paci.<br /><br />I just want to make sure when you wash these in the washer machine, you let them air dry.

My baby loves MAM pacis, they seem to be easier for her to keep in her mouth.  Another brand, Soothies, always fall out, like she's having trouble keeping them in.  These pacifiers are super-cute, and I love that they glow in the dark.  If she loses them at night, it's easy to find them without turning on a light.  I would definitely, definitely buy these again.
I just bought this 2 days ago and I absolutely love it!  My son is 3 months and I have been boiling the bottles in a pot.  What a time consuming tedious task thzat was.  Now I just LOVE to make bottles again.(ha ha)This is a great product takes 5 minutes to sterilize about 5 bottles.  Love it! Also so reasonably priced compared to the steam electric steralizers.
Works great for breastfeeding mothers.  Has a nice cutout for the nose for small babies, great for premies to use.  They're soft, not hard plastic, and helps our baby sleep through the night.  Highly highly recommend!!  Only downside is that it's hard to find these outside of Amazon, though they are starting to sell a variation of it under the First Years brand.
my kindergartners love this umbrella.  it's the right size so they don't take up the entire sidewalk or poke anyone.  we've haven't had any pinched fingers or problems with the quality.  it's nice that they can see through it.  i thought it might be too much of a baby theme because it's been years since they were interested in eric carle books, but they like it.
My newborn continued to root even after breast feeding and bottle supplementing. A nurse recommended these pacifiers and my son loves them. He uses them until he falls asleep and then he drops it out of his mouth. There is a small handle on its end that he holds onto sometimes. Since we seem to loose them around the house, we have repeated our purchase of these.
i bought this for my daughter who is now 3 mos. old. she has reflux and has to be sitting up at all times to keep her bottles down.  i bought this to keep her upright and give her bouncy seat a break! the first night she slept in it she absolutely loved it.  i put her in it for her morning nap and rocked it a little bit just to see her smile so big! she loves it!
My son really did not like to take the pacifier until we purchased this WubbaNub. Anytime you'd put the soothie in his mouth he would spit it out. I think the weight of the giraffe on the end makes it easier for him to keep it in his mouth. He now falls asleep easily with the WubbaNub in his mouth and I am pretty sure we will be ordering another one just in case!
this is a great aroma therapy toy. it heats up and lays perfectly next to my child while they sleep. it's just enough warmth so that i can fool them into thinking that they are snuggling me ;). the only downside here is that my son wanted to play with it and it's long and heavy so he got frustrated during the day time. at night though, it's the perfect companion.
My little one had a hard time with the Avent nipples when he was first born. This fit more easily into his little mouth and helped with the gas he was getting from improper suction. A lot of people think the construction is overly complicated but there aren't any more parts than in an Avent bottle. I love these bottles and wish I had found them for my first baby.
i had a lot of back pain carrying my son, and had to limit our time together because of that. my first carrier (chico) would not hold him well and i didn't feel comfortable with it. the babybjorn miracle is wonderful. he feels very comfortable on it even for long periods of time. my back is protected and the weight is distributed. i can hold him for over an hour.
These are so cute! They are good for a boy or girl. Who says you have to be a boy to have a stach lol. These were well packaged and arrived very quickly. My son loves them. The pictures I got from this are awesome. My son is 18 months old and uses it just like his other paci's. Also, if you want to the mustache piece pops off and you still have a regular pacifier.
These make such a difference compared to pacifiers without the little stuffed animal on it.  The stuffed animal stays in place on your baby's chest so if the pacifier pops out of their mouth, it doesn't go far and they can often find it again themselves.  It's terrific for self-soothing, and when we got this we had less interruptions in our sleep during the night.
I love natural rubber pacifiers. This one is really pliable and soft and my daughter just loves it. It is sanitary because water doesn't get trapped in. It does not leave marks on her face or when it falls out during sleep and she rolls over on it. I just wish it were a bit cuter, they should make the cutout a cute shape like a crown or flower like the Hevea ones.
These pacifiers are great!  We tried four different kinds for our newborn baby girl and these were the only ones that weren't too big for her little mouth.  As a result she's able to keep them in her mouth for longer (a plus for the parents!).  I am also breastfeeding and we gave these to her her first week home and she's never had a problem with nipple confusion.
this bathtub absolutely saved our sanity as first time parents.<br />our daughter hated bath time and we were always afraid that we were getting the water too hot, turns out we were getting it too cold!<br />she loves bath time now and we couldn't be happier.<br />it was an instant success.<br />i will be purchasing these again in the future for baby shower gifts.
the bugs/flower was much larger than i anticipated but makes it even more wonderful and worth the price. i am so in love with this mobile and it hangs right over my daughters crib. the light hits it and it is just amazing. i was looking for a mobile that wasn't cheesy or made of plastic. fits right in with my woodland themed nursery. favorite piece in her room!!!!
At first I used the MAM newborn pacifiers which my daughter also loved, since about 6 weeks we have started using these. They are very cute and she loves them. I have tried others and she won't take them. Some people don't like to give these to their babies, but it is reccomended now to give at bedtime to reduce risk for SIDS. So glad I chose these, they're great.
Our baby is breastfeeding and had found his hands so we were afraid he wouldn't take a soother, or it may interfere with feeding....but he took it immediately and loves it, plus he is still feeding like a champ! He doesn't drool as much with these ones as the orthodontic shape, and its pretty cool that you can see in his mouth as he sucks because the back is open.
Great item, pretty color I bought 2, I bought a camo clip to go with so it looks great with it. My Sonny takes it sometime but it's just him not the pacifier.  I Like the material and that it has a hole where I can stick the clip loop in unlike the ones that come from hospital and I like how it forms around the face unlike the ones from hospital that are circular.
After my first kiddo refused to take a paci, I was prepared for #2. I bought a stockpile of these (the same ones they use as the hospital) and we haven't had any issues with them besides them disappearing! They are different than the ones you can get in the big store, they have a more matte finish where the others are shiny, my little one definitely prefers these.
i first bought the blue organic boppy cover with the elephants on it- it was absolutely terrible. the colors bled with the first wash, the fabric was stiff and stained so easily. then i found this cover at a local thrift shop and purchased it. this cover is 1000000 times better- it's softer, the colors stay put, and it washes easier. don't bother with the others!!!
I introduced this to my son at three weeks. He wouldn't take a larger pacifier, but this is small enough to fit well in his mouth, and light enough that it won't fall out unless he pushes it out. Water does get in it when you clean it, but it takes half a second to squeeze it out. We got one as a shower gift, I've ordered two more, and I'm thinking of getting more.
These were the only pacifiers that our newborn took to when we introduced at 3 weeks. They are a little large but it doesn't seem to bother her and the shape keeps it from hitting her little nose. She wanted nothing to do with the soothies. For the price I definitely recommend trying these out, every kid is different of course but we couldn't be happier with these!
my wife picked this car seat and she is in love with it!  she loves the color and i have to say the colors and the soft breathable materials keep the car seat very cool.  it doesn't get hot like all the other car seats made out of that polyester shiny material.<br />i like that it is very safe and our 13 month old is very protected and comfortable in this car seat.
i purchased this when my child was just 2 months old. simple, not pink, toys are cute and soft, we interchange the toys with other toys she has sometimes and her all time favorite must have on the go toy is the owl this play activity comes with. the little pillow is perfect for under her head or chest. we play with this at least once a day in some way. i recommend.
I have tried pretty much all types of paci straps and this is by far our favorite. The clip is easy to use and stays well, even when baby pulls on it. The other end is just a loop and works on all pacis that have a ring. Only bummer is it doesn't work on the newer fancy pacis that don't have rings. We just don't take that kind out of the house, so we don't need it.
im a mom of 2 boys who weigh 37lbs and 25lbs, im just 5ft tall as well. jogging with the boys has been so easy for me comparing it to other jogging strollers. i completely love the stroller, it does look big but most side by side strollers look big. the stroller fits just fine through the front door, we have a suv so we have plenty of space when we take it with us.
we've been using this product for about a week now and so far so good! the foam pieces are a little on the thin side but because there are so many in a pack i just put two on the door and it works great (previous reviews mention this as well). you can't beat the price on these and they're super cute for kids. they store very easily on the door knob when not in use.
As a newborn he could only use a Soothie preemie paci because his mouth was small even though he was full term. By 4 & 1/2 months he needed to move to a newborn size so we decided to try a Wubbanub. He adores his monkey Wubba and it fits him way better now that he is a bigger guy. :) And best of all it is easy to find and doesn't bounce and roll when he drops it :)
i absolutely love these diapers. i'm a first time mom (and a single one at that) and was nervous about all of time and effort needed for cloth diapers. these are the easiest things i have ever used and the fact that they are adjustable makes it even better. i had priced similar ones at buy buy baby and other places and these seem to be the best priced ones as well.
Love this. It matches everything, super soft, holds up well after many washes (machine wash cold, air dry). Baby loves it especially when going to sleep. Baby is 9 months but when she was a newborn it was great because it was easy to find and stayed in her mouth well. I also have 2 pink princess ones and they both are falling apart:( Definitely recommend the monkey.
these are great. my newborn can keep this paci in his mouth better than soothies. the nipple is the same shape as the soothie which was important since i'm nursing. we have had zero nipple confusion. our lactation consultant also recommended using a paci (soothies or gumdrops only to prevent confusion) saying they've actually been recommended to prevent sids...SOLD.
I'm so happy I finally bought this! My 9 month old would always fall hard on the hard mat his Baby Trend pack n play came with. This fits SO snugly and it doesn't move. Even with all his rolling and bouncing around! I'm pregnant with my 2nd and will use this until he/she gets big enough for a crib. I just wish I had this when my 9 month old slept in his pack n play.
Saw this on SharkTank, bought it for my sister who is expecting. I was impressed with the quality, it far exceeded my expectations!  The movement of the cords up and down is so smooth it doesn't even make a sound. I love that it fits all types of pacifiers so you're not stuck buying only their pacifiers. I wish I had another baby just so I could buy one for myself!!
our old stroller just wasn't fitting her well anymore.  she would place her feet on the wheels and the seat size was too small.  this stroller is lightweight, easy to steer and easy for the grandmother to use.  we have another lightweight stroller that was around $200.  this one isn't quite as nice.  but for the price you can't go wrong.  i recommend it to everyone.
absolutely love this product! i wish i had it with my 1st two kids.  with my 3rd i exclusively pump and this is a life saver.  im able to work, drive, read, feed baby, put baby to sleep, etc... all while i am pumping.  this is great and is so easy to use, holds well and is super comfy.  will recommend this to everyone.  also, i use a medela pump in style, no issues.
great price, great product.  we have a giant puppy that's not ready to roam the house so keeping her in the kitchen with this gate has been a huge help.  it's strong enough to keep a large puppy inside as she jumps on it and bangs at it.  we have a wide opening between our kitchen and dining room and this gate was easy to manage to create the perfect size we needed.
bought this for my daughter for christmas and she loves it!! sit in it to read her books, drink her milk in the morning, watch her shows. she loves it and i do to. very well made, made in the usa. the only thing we had to assemble was putting the wooded rocker pieces on the bottom.. material is really nice and you can tell it was well made. not cheap looking at all.
these spoons are awesome!  they are actually like a spoon in the fact that they hold watery baby cereal or food.  the gerber spoons are almost totally flat and just make a very frustrating mess.  i threw all my gerber spoons away when these arrived.    the only bummer is that shipping is almost the same price as the spoons - but it is so worth it!  excellent product!
great calendar to record your babies first year. i received a different one for my first child as a gift and loved it, so i wanted to find another one for my second child.  i came across this one that is very similar to the other.  it has cute little designs and graphics to make it eye-catching and has everything you need to record all of you baby's firsts.  so cute!
just got my son's necklace today! he recently turned one and after suffering through teething and with 4 more teeth coming in at once,i thought it was time he got his first teething necklace :) so far he hasn't tried to pull it off or break it,he actually pushes me away when i try to take it off lol! i'm going to give it a few days and see if it helps with his teeth.
These are the best binkis around.  My daughter is breast fed exclusively and she has been taking these binks since she was about two months and has never wanted any other kind. We have tons of them now and they clean easily. We bought a cheap clevamama microwave sterilizer for binks from this site and they fit right on the branches inside it and clean up beautifully.
I don't know how my baby lived without this! She is 9 months old now and has been using it daily since she was 3 months. She prefers it to any other pacifier (and doesn't seem to mind that she's still using the &#34;small&#34; size). Such a smart design -- once they start grasping toys they can easily get this pacifier back into their mouth on their own without help.
i would've loved to have had one of these when i was little; i'm sure it would've helped me with my huge fear of the dark back then.<br /><br />basically, this precious turtle transforms the plain dark into a starry night. these are like cut-out stars, not little dots like a planetarium. not sure it offers much educational value, but it sure is a treasure to look at.
The Blue Super Soothie Pacifier looks like the ordinary green ones but is made of thicker material.  It works wonderfully for older children.  My 19 mos old son is teething and chews on his hands constantly.  He won't use teething toys but he chews the edge of the pacifier.  He could bite through the green ones but the blue one is thick enough he cannot bite through.
Best option for nursing baby if choose to give pacifier. Despite being a strong believer in nursing and therefore originally adamantly opposed to using a pacifier, I learned pacifiers are helpful for some children. These were recommended by occupational therapists to help baby learn to suck. Also good for oral development at times. Easy to sanitize, simple, reliable.
this diaper is affordable and excellent. it doesn't leak, is easy to clean, and dries quickly. a month ago i ordered a variety of cloth diapers and this one is my favorite. i have ordered 8 more alva baby diapers. also my baby is a very slender baby. i was concerned about ordering a one size for her because she was so small, but it didn't leak and is growing with her.
If your baby started using one of these pacifiers as a newborn, it can be hard to switch over to other pacifiers once they have learned a preference.  This was the case in my baby.  She only liked her pacifier from the hospital.  I was happy to find the same hospital recommended brand online.  The 2 pack gives you a spare for the diaper bag which is really convenient.
My baby was given a Soothie brand pacifier in the NICU so we stayed with it when we got home. This giraffe is great! When he spits it out we don't lose it, and it's so easy to find in the middle of the night. The giraffe is even better than his dinosaur version as it is a little smaller and he can easily grab the neck to keep hold of it. I'll be buying these as gifts.
Wubanubs are AWESOME! When you first bring the baby home, you can use the legs of the stuffed animal to prop the pacie so that it stays in your baby's mouth. They are also great for traveling as the weight helps to keep them in. With our now 6 month old, she can play with it as well. We keep a few around the house. And they are washable! We recommend them to everyone!
my 5 month old is very tall (98th percentile), but still was too short for other jumpers. this one is perfect with the 5 height settings! the seat itself is large but if your baby likes to &#34;stand&#34; and has good trunk control the large seat will not be a problem.  he absolutely loves it and can turn himself around to each &#34;station&#34;. definitely recommend!
This is the cutest little thing for my daughter. She already loves touching it, and feeling the legs, ears, and textures. She is only 2 and a half months, and this is teaching her how to hold things, and put it in her mkouch. It is very convenient! The picture makes it look like it's big, but it's actually very tiny. I would say about 4 inches. It is the perfect size.
Both of my children used WubbaNub.  I love how easy it is to locate in the room by finding the plush toy.  When it gets dirty, I throw it in the washing machine and then let it air dry.  After it is dry, I clean and sanitize the pacifier in the bottle warmer.  I like to buy this pack of three to give out to all of my friends who are expecting.  It is the perfect gift.
it not as big as the picture seems, but it still looks nice!...i added some flowers to the tree from another order just to give the room a little color, an wow, it looks great.. my daughter (4) love this....it looks like a shadow, to a 4 yr old the can be really scary waking up an seeing that in the middle of the night, so some pink flowers, an some birds...we love it
we use these often for our twins.  they are a nice size for the beginning eater, and the coating on the spoon seems to be kind to little gums.  one of our babies chews on the spoon when eating, and so far the coating has not shown any wear.  the white did stain when we ate carrots.  i like that the handle is made of recycled materials, and that it was made in the usa.
This is our most favorite wubbanub.  My son will only use 'ducky' and 'lamby', and I'm not sure what we would do without them!!!  I buy this for all new mommies that I know.  My son loves to hold onto lamby's ears and ducky's arms, and it's amazing in the middle of the night how he can hold onto these guys and feel for them in his crib when they fall out of his mouth.
These are essential for your diaper bag. I am not comfortable with sticking a binkie off the floor in my baby's mouth (straight in, or wiping it off on my pants, or sticking it in my mouth first), so these are handy to be able to wipe it off. I use them for binkies, bottle nipples, and toys. I do wish they were a little more economical, but I wouldn't be without them!
super soft! stays soft after washing and doesn't stain. the blue color is true to the photo. fits the summer infant changing pad perfectly; however, there aren't any holes to fit the pad's safety straps through, but that was no problem for us as we don't use them (we use the pad on the floor of our living room when changing diapers downstairs). the price can't be beat!
as others have posted, there are some obvious ways this product could be improved (batteries, easier/multiple time settings, volume control, etc.).  however, compared to similar products, this is the best.  it accomplished what i needed.  my daughter does not get up until the cow on the picture does.  it gives her a sense of independence and gives me much needed sleep!
this is perfect for booster seats because there's no back. the texture reminds me of a floor mat that is just rubber. it will be so easy to clean.<br />for car seats with backs, i recommend the brica seat guardian because it protects the whole seat. http://www.amazon.com/brica-seat-guardian-car-protector/dp/b00b7m7bkw/ref=pd_sbs_ba_2?ie=utf8&refrid=1bqj37yscthaxg8c6cs4
we got this as a gift for our baby shower in october and used it in our bedroom before she was born. we left it on for days on end and the batteries haven't died yet (4 months later)! we have attached it to our lil one's carseat and it soothes her whenever we are out and about. it's small, discreet and powerful. i always give this as a gift to my new mommy friends now!
These are one of my go-to baby shower presents.  They are not only cute, but functionally, keep the pacifier in the baby's mouth better than most other pacifiers because they are weighted with the stuffed animal.  My sister recycled these for her 4 kids and highly recommends them.  When they need to be cleaned, just throw them into the washing machine with some clothes.
i love this seat. my daughter is 2 1/2 and still uses it for every meal. we do not travel with it. we use it clamped to our breakfast bar instead of a big ugly plastic highchair. best of all, since it doesn't look like a \\baby\\ chair she is still willing to sit in it and cannot escape during dinner. i am about to buy another one for my 9 month old. highly recommended.
I thought many times whether I should have our newborn get used to pacifiers but after much deliberation and research- I went for it and purchased these GumDrop pacis.  So far so good.  Our 4 week old baby boy loves the pacifier and definitely helps for him to be soothed.<br />Because it is not one of those orthodontic paci types- babies will not be too dependent on it.
we tried several sippy cups before finally finding one that my 17 month old daughter would use  our issue with other cups was that she likes to lay back in the morning and evening when she drinks her milk and all the other sippy cups flow to quickly.  this is the only cup that she can lay back, not have it drip, and drink without having to stop, swallow and start again.
this chair has been great for my 5 month old son. he outgrew his bouncer so i opted for this one since they can use it through toddlerhood. it is great for strapping him in to play and he will nap in it in the reclined position. just note that it does not rock on it's own, only vibrates...still great for the price. it also folds down nicely and is very light for travel.
We have a preemie and this toy:  a) came with a GREAT pacifier. Its the Soothie hospitals use and her small mouth can latch on and STAY ON  b) is smaller than we thought it would be but it is still very graspable.   c) we've only had this for a day and she's already learned how to grab it and place it back in her mouth.      This is a must have for preemies and newborns.
this is my favorite style of these bowls (i think i have them all!). the two compartments are perfect for apple slices in one side and peanut butter for dipping in the other. or for veggies and dip or whatever duo your child prefers. love the rubber bottoms. keeps the bowls in place. very nice quality. they have been through the dishwasher many times and still look good.
if i could do 10 stars, i would!!  the customer service is just absolutely awesome.  i needed these asap so i contacted the seller and got an email within the hour. once the details were discussed and decided upon, it really was shipped out immediately. the mittens themselves really are bigger than the newborn ones. and they're soft and cute. wish i bought these earlier!
My son was born 8-12-14, He was in our local NICU so they gave us this !!!! We love it !! Its easier to find and it seems to hold its spot in his mouth prior to him being born I was like I think the pacifiers are ugly. Also we usually create nick name for the pacifier ( instead of BoBo) We just ask where clifford and everyone in the house knows what we are talking about.
My baby will not accept any pacifier other than this brand.  We have them strewn about our house and cars.  As other reviewers have noted, it's pretty cute to watch that little &#34;o&#34; through the transparent nipple.  Tip for weaning them off of it when you finally need to: poke a hole in the tip---it's no longer as satisfying for them and they give it up themselves!
easy instructions,  stroller is light weight, practical and durable.  i purchased this stroller as an \\extra\\ to keep at grandpa's when baby visits, so as not to have to bring a stroller on the plane.  we like this one even better than the more expensive  stroller at home. it was shipped quickly and arrived even earlier than promised. very satisfied with this purchase.

These are the only pacifiers that my daughter will take. She is exclusively breastfed and these cause her no nipple confusion. While we were in the hospital, they gave her NUK pacifiers and they were too big for her little mouth. Every time we gave one to her she would choke, cough, and scream. We went out and bought a pack of Soothies and we will never use anything else.
We LOVE our giraffe Wubbanub!  I bought one before our baby was born to try it out, since I thought it was expensive for a pacifier.  But it's worth every penny.  It's great for keeping the pacifier close, babies love to snuggle the soft toy, and you don't lose pacifiers when your baby spits them out.  I ended up buying two more Wubbanubs because I liked this one so much!
this pad is perfect for our gender neutral nursery.  we have a baby girl, but wanted things not too &#34;girly&#34;.  this print fits the bill nicely.  the material is soft and it washes beautifully.  stains come right out in normal washing. there didn't seem to be any shrinkage and the band has retained it's stretchiness, so that it fits the same over the pad every time.
My son loved his soothie, so I decided to try this out. He is inseperable from it! I got it for him when he was only a few weeks old, and now at 4 months he can put the soothie in his own mouth, and is quite comfortable picking up and holding the dragon. He also strokes it's fur, and I find him hugging it in his sleep. I plan on purchasing at least one more sometime soon!
My baby hated the rubber pacifiers which I bought to try to go as natural as possible. Also the rubber ones sorta blocked her nose. These have a nice space for my baby's nose and its the only one she'll take. Also, contacted maker and asked if product was BPA free and they assured me that it was. I guess at one point the plastic shield wasnt BPA free but that has chnaged.
The Wubbanub keeps the paci from disaappearing in the carseat,  helps keep paci in baby's mouth...if it falls out my son is able to put it back in his mouth easily, the monkey is so cute and is perfect size for baby's hands.  My son enjoys holding it in his hands while he sucks his paci--it helps soothe him to sleep...he has become pretty attached to his wubbanub already.
These pacifiers are great. The best part is that if my son drops it when sleeping, he won't get a mark on his face if he accidently sleeps on it. He also doesn't get that ring around his mouth from sucking to hard like other pacifiers.  Plus I like think its cute to see the little hole in his mouth when he sucks. It's also super easy to throw in the hot water to sterlize.
my daughter has been using this as a baby bag (for her daughter) for almost a year.  it is sturdy and has heck of a lot of pockets and room.  i get lost using it every time.  too many pockets for my 49 year old brain.  this bag has come on road trips and grocery store trips, to the babysitters and thrown in the back of the car.  it has stood up to our abuse... so far.  :)
Don't know what it is about the WubbaNubs but my baby niece won't take any other pacifiers. This is the fifth one I buy for her. The attached toys seem to enchant to the baby and the shape of the pacifier itself seems to perfectly fit her little mouth.<br />The toys can be detached after the baby stops using the pacifier so... it's a good buy.<br />I definitely recommend.
My daughter will not touch any other pacifier! She loves them...I love them!  I just throw them in the sanitizer with her bottles.  They are soft.  Love that the nose area is open.  Love that the nipple is a little shorter...seems like others that I tried were too long and would gag her.  Very happy with them and have ordered many extra so we can have them always on hand!
I love this pacifier compared to the other version which I love to. I love this one because when my daughter sleeps with it in her mouth when she's on her stomach it is flat but when I want to attach it to a cord so it doesn't end up everywhere when we are out it also has that capability! I Couldn't say anything more that would make this item more perfect! Great job NUK!!
Now that child #2 is here, we realize the importance of a pacifier. We've used several different brands, but always came back to Nuk. These just seem to fit for us, and can be found in pretty much every brick & mortar if you are in an emergency. Enjoy the sports theme, essentially 2 pacifiers for each season. Your kid will look cool in his NFL onesie and football pacifier.
this \\jesus loves me musical baby plush lamb\\ is a heart-warming and a most precious gift. the lamb is well made, is soft and cuddly and is truly a wonderful gift with eternal significance. i would highly recommend this gift for a little child.  as scripture says, \\train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it.\\ proverbs 22:6.
i bought this for my precious granddaughter. she presently has a heavy winter blanket, and since spring and summer are around the corner, i thought this would be perfect for her. i haven't been to visit yet, her family lives eight hours away from me :(<br />this lovie is very nice quality, very soft and well made. i will update after i see her in june, i hope she loves it!
i bought this for my craft room, but i barely got it out of the box before my 11 year old daughter was begging for it! the glass ball is so high quality and smooth. and the little remote works great. the colors are beautiful, and i love the fade mode. it provides the nicest soothing glow. i ended up letting her have it for her room. so i guess i'll have to buy another one!
i had originally purchased and used another tub for my infant son - once he got to about 3 months old the other tub was awkward and uncomfortable and he hated bath time.<br /><br />this tub is great. the slight recline on the reclining infant side is perfect, and he doesn't slide around. i like that the plastic seat has no hard, angular edges so it's much more comfortable.
We really like these pacifiers. We've found that these are the only ones our daughter will take, won't even take the Soothie brand even though the nipple shape is the same. We've been getting good use out of them so far. I've found that boiling them does change the color a little - makes them a tad lighter, but it doesn't have any effect on their performance and structure.
This is a great pacifier! We were given our first set in the hospital   when we had our daughter. It was recommended by the nurses who worked in the pedi-unit. You cannot find these in stores, that I know of, so only option is to order on-line. Any parent that I know who has these cannot have enough of them! I highly recommend these pacifiers above any others you can buy!!
These pacifiers are great. A one piece design, for less germs. Unisex colors, these are silicone and last a long time. These are for newborns and up. The nipple is small, so I would think not for infants past four months in age. Designed by dentists, and mothers, this design fits under the nose and air holes keeps the pacifier from forming hickies on the skin. Great design.
i love these pj's! they are very cute, thin like a t-shirt, and stretchy enough they can be worn longer than a typical garment. you will not be dissatisfied.     as for the zipper, it does stick a little at first, but after a few washings its just fine. i have not seen pj's like this bigger than 9 mos, so i was thrilled these go up to 24 mos.     ps. shipping takes forever!
My baby have been using avent pacifier till 3 months and I decided to change it. She always spit out the avent and I have to hold it for her. I bought NUK and Dr Brown for her to try. She like it instantly. No more popping out. Yet to try the NUK since she like Dr Brown.<br />It only comes with 1 pacifier cover instead of 2. I have to reuse the avent cover, luckily it fits.
THESE ARE GREAT, THESE WERE NOT IN THE STORES WHEN I HAD MY CHILDREN. I AM SORTA A GERM-A-FOBE AND I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY GRANDDAUGHTER AND IT IS ALWAYS IN USE THIS LIL THINGAMABOB STOPS YOUR BABY FROM GETTING GERMS OR VIRUSES OR INFECTIONS. I LOVE THIS PACI CRADLE AND MY DAUGHTER DOES TOO, THE ONLY TIME THAT IT IS NOT INUSE IS WHEN THE BABY IS SLEEP OR FEEDING. THANX AMAZON.
I never thought I would purchase this, but it's been a ilfesaver. Now I always have an extra pacifier on hand, and I don't have to dig through my huge diaper bag to find an extra - comes in handy when baby is screaming and her pacifier is nowhere to be found!  It's not absolutely necessary, but it has made life easier more than once! It also matches my diaper bag perfectly.
If you're having a rock n' roll baby, or even if you're just hoping your baby will grow up cool - this is the pacifier for you. It looks cool, it stands up to a lot of suck and people won't comment on your parenting choice to give a pacifier when it's in because they'll focus on how awesome it is. What more can I say? Avoid the judgment, raise a fun kid - get this pacifier.
my 4year old daughter has limited range of motion in her legs and this stroller works really well. i was searching for a stroller that was comfortable for an older child and not too bulky. we have a jogging stroller that works well but is heavy and awkward to take in the car. this stroller is perfect and the leg rest is sturdy and soft on her legs, while in the up position.
this is by far the best investment thus far i have made. i am a mom of 3 and i purchased this for our newest addition. she was colicky in the beginning and at times this was the only way i could get things done around the house. now that she's a bit older, we still use it every week for our grocery trip at minimum.  she snuggles right in and within 15 minutes, she's asleep.
our son sleeps in a sleep sack every night- this one is the perfect weight year round. not too heavy or too light. the way it zips makes it easy to get on and off, this is especially nice in the middle of the night. there is enough room for our son to kick his legs and be comfortable. seems to be good quality and holds together when washed. definitely would buy another one.
i have a 5 month old and this is a big wow at our house. my daughter is fascinated by the pink color and it is so much easier to feed as only the right amount of food is dispensed each time you squeeze. i have noticed that it is lot less messy than the traditional way. i only wish i had this product with my first child of 5 years. the one that i got had the label 'bpa-free'
This thing is so cute!! It's a lot smaller than i thought it was going to be, but i don't know why i expected it to be bigger. It is for a baby after all. Duh.<br />But! we have a brand new baby, and this stays in his mouth so much better than a normal pacifier! He folds his little hands over it and it looks like he is snuggling it.<br />Sooooo adorable &#60;3 &#60;3 &#60;3
We got this for our son when he was a few months old.  It has been with him every nap and bedtime.  He absolutely loves it.  And just as we were ready to break him of it (after two years) our son pulled and pulled on the paci and it separated from the Bevo and it was a great way to say Oh no...its broken  I am glad it wore out when it did.  Made the transition much easier!!
We got one of these when our daughter was born a few weeks ago and looked around to find some more. They're very hard to find in stores and mainstream brand has even copied the design and name (not sure if it was licensed?). The reviews on that product aren't ideal, but this pacifier is much softer and is one that my daughter will take much more than any others we've tried.
just got mine today. absolutely love everything about this black backpack. i would recommend it to all my mom friends, it also can be worn by daddy. fits everything i need for the baby and myself :) bought this for baby #2. i have an about to be 3 year old and a new one on the way. had a regular diaper bag with my first and hated it! im so in love with this diaper backpack!
i am so very impressed! my order was fulfilled through amazon and they goofed with one of the 4 items. i contacted the seller and they went above and beyond what i would have expected to fix the issue. because of this amazing service and beautiful quality - i will find a reason to shop this seller as often as possible. i'm thankful i found her! good prices and quality items.
This MAM gift set is nice! We don't use the binky, but these bottles are great. There are 2 smaller bottles with size 1 nipples and 2 larger bottle with size 2 nipples. The only issue I have with MAM bottles is when warming he milk, it tends to leak, so we now have to use a different bottle to warm the milk and transfer it to these bottles. The baby likes it so we are happy.
Super helpful in holding the paci in the newborn's mouth.  I used this along with the swaddle.  Sometimes I'd wrap a burp cloth around the animal body and the baby to make sure the paci didn't fall out in the middle of the nap.  I know, mother of the year over here.  My now six-month-old still uses the wubbanub as a toy - he likes to gnaw on the paci and animal body for fun.
My son uses this as a blankie to suck his thumb.  The first one was purchased as a gift but as he grew more attached, I purchased another for daycare & another for when the first needed to be washed.  He doesn't used it to chew on but to rub on his face when he sucks his thumb.  He's been using them for about 6 months & after repeated washings, they are all holding up great!
My daughter loves these things and I'm having trouble breaking her of them at 2+ years old, but the new baby hates them and won't take a pacifier.  I still think they're the best pacifiers on the market (even if he won't take one).  They always helped my daughter to keep her mouth flanged out... then it was easier for her not to &#34;clamp down&#34; on me when breastfeeding.
These are the BEST pacifiers.  Solidly made, one-piece molded silicone.  They are not huge and round like the Soothie brand.  Nice shape to fit a baby's mouth perfectly.  Loved the newborn ones and paid extra just to be able to use these orthodontic ones as she got older.  Recommended by many hospitals.  If i have a second child, i will definitely be using this brand again!!
i love the travel container and my baby loves this spoon. i'm a first time mom and it was so overwhelming trying to find a spoon to use with our baby now that we're trying solid foods. this one is soft on her gums and the shape makes it easy for us to angle it up when feeding her without food getting all over the place.  i bought more to have in our rotation. highly recommend
The expected mom loved it. It got here fast.<br />Would buy again. Other people asked me where I got it.<br />Though I think you have to wait till baby gets older, not for new born.<br />You should buy it if you want a unique gift. That's why I bought it. My friend was saying at the baby shower she got lots of new born clothes and the baby would never be able to use them all.
This was, hands down, my little girl's favorite from the time she was a newborn.  She was quite tiny, so other pacifiers were easily lost if she spit them out.  However, her caterpillar Wubbanub was fantastic.  She would play with the antennae while she took the pacifier and, on the rare occasion when it did get away from her, it was MUCH easier to find than a pacifier alone!
daughter loves the infantino grow-with-me activity gym & ball pit. so far she is only old enough to be using the stage 1 toys, but will soon be able to start holding and playing with the balls for the pit. at times she will even fall asleep playing for so long under it while still holding onto the toys. product seems well built and i am completely satisfied with the purchase.
We currently have 4 of these. Here is what's great about these. When they fall out of your child's mouth it conventionally sits right below their mouth so they can get the wub back ion there mouth them self. It is also easy for them to see and grab onto. My daughter throws her around and plays with it. It's a toy and bink in one :)<br /><br />LOVE these..Buy one don't wait :)
i've bought a few kits before with my first baby, but they were either overpriced or inferior. this is the first one i believe is worth every cent. my baby is less fussy since the nipples reduce gas, and they are easy to clean up. the bottle brush is a true pleasure to use, not too stiff to damage the nipple, and not too soft to be useless.  recommened this package to anyone!
Love these pacifiers... unlike some of the ones that are specially shaped for orthodontic reasons (such as Nuk), these ones are the same at any orientation, which makes it easy for a baby to put it back in his/her mouth. I tried another brand, and it was frustrating for my child because she would sometimes put it back in upside down. With this one, it's impossible to do that!
We would be lost without a few of these - one in the each car and one in the house. Seriously, the kid loves it. We are a little worried about having to break the habit, but willing to take that chance for the comfort this gives her now. They are well constructed, they come in numerous styles, and they are easy to wash. We have purchased several of these for friends now, too.
I got these over the Phillips and other pacifier. Those have a nipple that is slanted or has a flat end that is better for teething. I talked to a lactation specialist and she said the completely round ones are better for newborns because if you planning to breast feed, it imitates the nipple better. I liked this better because the &#34;shield&#34; has a cut out for the nose.
it is nice that the main lid screws on &#34;backwards&#34; so you (or little fingers) don't unscrew the main lid when undoing the little orange one.  it is also nice that these are dishwasher safe - in my house it needs to be dishwasher safe it would like to survive.  my 2 1/2 year old still uses them and i used it to put pizza sauce in when i made homemade 'pizza lunchables'.
Love this pacifier/teether. My 7 month NEVER used a pacifier but needs to SUCK on something. This thing is HUGE...he doesn't really use it like a pacifier to suck on the nipple part, he just sucks on all the parts! It's great because every piece of this is suckable!! He totally grabs for this all the time and it's not a choking hazard because it's so big. I bought two of them!
solid caps are a must if you're traveling with the bottles. we don't use formula yet but i bet you would need these to mix up formula in the bottle too as it would just get stuck in all the bottle parts and clump. anyway, no leaking with these caps just a pain though that i have to carry a seperate zip bag with the other bottle parts as this lid won't work with those attached.
These are the best pacifiers and everyone I know who uses them says their kids love them as well.  I get a kick out of watching them used by either way, our daughter loved the little stuffed animal on the end.  Also, it helps make them a little larger which is nice since its easier to keep an eye on them.  I don't love the look of the rubber pacifier without the animal either.
This product changed our life!  In the beginning the Wub-a-nub is great because it acts as a weight on the baby's chest so that they do not lose it as often.  You can even wrap a swaddle around it to ensure that it stays put.  As they get older, the stuffed animal is something that they can feel for and find in the dark.  My little girl loves her wub and so do her Mom and Dad!
I love these pacifiers because my son loves them so much. I tried every pacifier I could find on the market and he spit all of them out except this one. It is comforting to him when he is upset and works well when it is time to go to bed since he is weaning off his bottle. Since they come in a two pack, I don't have to worry if one gets misplaced. Great value and a great price!
this cute butterfly is sturdy and colorful and the perfect compliment to tie back curtains.  i have a tangled theme in my granddaughter's room.  i used purple sheer curtains and tied them back with this butterfly.  i used the &#34;command&#34; brand damage-free hanging hooks to keep the curtains and butterfly pulled back to the edge of the wall. i highly recommend this product.
i brought this bag in intentions to carry all of my reusable menstrual pads, it worked greatly! even with my collection growing i still always have room in this bag.  however, one &#34;con&#34; is that it doesn't keep heavy odors out well enough, good enough though, i still love it.<br /><br />nice and waterproof, no leeks, however i haven't really tested that. but a great bag!
I bought these for my 6 month old even though they are labeled for 0-3 months because these are the same size pacifiers that she has on her wubbanub. She loves her wubbanub to cuddle and play with but we wanted to have a couple spare pacifiers on had as well. I use these in place of the wubbanub mostly when I wear her in a wrap or carrier, any other time she wants her wubbanub!
If your child likes a binky, then this product is for you. It is a lifesaver on long car rides - prevents mom or dad from having to fumble around in the car seat for a lost binky. It stays on baby's chest, and she can even put it back in all by herself sometimes (3 months old). It's also easy to clean and very cute. Love the WubbaNub... I just wish I had thought of it first! :)
i first came across this when a friend told me her son's ot recommended it as one of the best toys to get your kid. now i'm sold. my little one loves it because it's light and easy to hold for her. it's also great for when you have another slightly older toddler with a love of throwing things as hard as he can and a new baby in the house :) (in other words - it's soft/flexible)
love love love this! i bought a few of the soft silicone freezer trays as well and this one is by far my favorite! i was worried the cubes would be hard to remove since this tray isn't flexible, but you actually push on the edge of the cube to remove and it is so easy-worth the money just for that reason. the fact that it makes so many cubes at one time is also very convenient.
great feel. i have large fingers and when i finally look at my finished product after typing, i'm amazed at the jibberish i produced. now with my new stylus, i'm saving time. it feels great in your hand and you tap and not push like you would with the rubber tipped stylus. thanks to joto, i'm now able to jot down what i mean instead of hope and wish i'm accomplishing something.
this is by far my baby's favorite teether!  i love that the material is safe and the little nubbies desensitize his gums for when we introduce a toothbrush.  he loves that it's easy for him to hold (started using it around 4-5 months old) and he can chew on the smooth or textured parts and get relief in all areas of his mouth.  we love this teether and he uses it everyday!  :-)
these wipes work really well.  i use them for cleaning my son's bum at diaper changes, and even with messy poops i almost always just need one.  they wash well, maybe shrink a small amount so the edges aren't perfectly even anymore, but i&#34;m using them for his bum so i don't care.  same with the colors - i got exactly what's pictured, but it really makes no difference to me.
This pacifier was my babies favorite. Its just like the hospital one except the little nose part is cut out. Its great! When your baby is little you will feel like the hospital binky is pressing against the baby nose. It isn't, but you won't worry about that with this pacifier. I buy a 5 pack at a time and give one to every new baby that is born to my friends. Its a great gift!
My daughter Isley loves her sweeties. After purchasing God Bless lamb my 7 year old niece encouraged me to get Isley the collection so she can have unlimited friends. Her favorite by far is Bella Ella. I find joy in renaming her friends and watching her eyes light up during a game of hid and seek to find them! Awesome product! Multiple choices also help with outfit coordination!
My son was very particular about what type of pacifiers he would use.  If it wasn't a mustache, he wasn't interested in using it.  I ended up buying at least 6 different Mustachifiers because he loved them so much.  The expressions on peoples faces when they saw him were priceless.  There were many times people would look at him and burst out laughing.  It was great!  Very cute!
This is a required item to safely bathe your baby....ask the many parents who tragically tried to bathe Junior in the tub or the sink, only to have a soapy baby slip out of their hands and hit its head or worse. Fits over standard sinks or can be placed in the bathtub for easy use. Also light and easy to carry for trips. I camp a lot and this is ideal for bathing the small ones.
My baby girls love these pacifiers.  They have a &#34;fat&#34; end, so they are able to hold onto them a little better.  The latex is squishier than the silicone, which I like, too.  My twins are breast fed and they have no problems going back and forth between the breast and these.  Only complaint....it would be nice to have more color options, but that really isn't a big deal.
My baby loved these MAM pacifiers. The glow in the dark function is nice for sleep deprived parents in the middle of the night. We used these during the day too -  I like the subdued colors. Makes it far less garish than some of those huge colorful pacis out there. We did have to start using the larger 6+ month version because these are quite small. Not a one-size-fits-all deal.
The problem with baby products is that I can't actually use them.  Well I could, but that would be kind of weird.  Anyway, I have an almost newborn niece who still uses pacifiers, so this seemed like a good idea.  I'm not a scientist with a microscope, so I can't say if this gets them more sterile or less than other methods.  I guess it works well enough.<br /><br />That is all.
You need to get more than one, because it becomes such a favorite. Our grandson loves his monkey. Before he could grasp, he could still pull it into him because of the attached toy. We have twin grandchildren, boy and girl. One is not into pacifiers, and her Wabbanub was never a hit, but the other had more trouble calming, and this helped him keep his needed soother in his mouth.
Worth the extra cost simply because it's so much easier to find now! Our daughter is still too little to hold onto it but I could see her doing so in no time which is another perk as hopefully then it's not falling out 50 times per minute. We also have an active toddler boy so something like that matters to us :) Only thing that could make it better was if it also sang lullabies.
these things are brilliant - the top twists on & locks into place, making it virtually impossible for my toddler to dump its contents all over the place (like he used to w/ the two-handled snack cup.) cereal, chips, puffs, dried fruit; they're all kept easily on-hand & ready for snacking. the flip-up lid is a nice touch, but rarely used in my house as snacks never last that long.
bought for my 10 year old grandson for christmas.  i was impressed by the quality in the package upon arrival.  it was his favorite gift on christmas morning.  he started using without instructions and keep busy for hours.  the items are top quality wood and store together in the big box.  it just would be nice to have a way to keep the box closed for storage when not performing.
The MAM brand are the best Pacifiers that I have found so far. My daughter used a Pacifier up until she was a year and a half. She tended to chew on them and other brands wouldn't hold up for very long before getting ripped up. These held up and are very durable. Was signed up for Amazon Mom so free shipping and this qualified to earn extra months of prime account.<br /><br />CJB
works great! easy to install and keeps our baby out, but our older toddler is able to open and close it on his own. when we bought this we had forgotten that our older toddler actually would need to be able to open it since he's potty trained. well no problem, he was able to learn it in 10 minutes. well worth the money to keep our baby's curious hands out of the dang toilet water!
Once my newborn reaches a deep sleep, I place him in his pack n' play with this bear in the corner with the volume on low.  This bear works great for keeping him asleep and the sound isn't nearly as obnoxious as some of the lullaby music that we have to listen to on his swing.  I would definitely recommend this because it's super cute (baby's first teddy) and it works for my baby!
i love the adjustable handlebar in the new flex!!! bob revolution is the best there is in terms of strollers. very satisfied! the duallie fits through all doors in public, but people are quick to comment or help hold doors when they see you heading for an exit! they underestimate the skills of a momma or the precision of bob! worth every cent. good sale on amazon around labor day.
We had received another set of bottles for our newborn son; however, the hospital provided an MAM bottle in our take home bag. We tried it and liked it so well, we purchased this set. We liked the pacifiers so much, we purchased some more. Our son almost never spits up using these bottles. They are well designed and so easy to clean. We will definitely continue using MAM products.
I bought a different brand pacifier pocket first and it did not zip closed and I was always loosing pacifiers and they were getting dirty because the design of the pocket was awful.  Now that I have this one I am much happier!  I can fit two pacifiers in it and zip it closed.  I will be ordering another one - as you can't have enough of these for clean and secure pacifier storage!
I adore these wubbanubs. My daughter has had the lamb since she was born and it's gotten a little ragged. I wanted to order another one because I pull my hair out trying to find it when it's lost. I loved the colors of this one and the ease of holding it since it's shape. It doesn't seem as soft as the lamby, but it's adorable and I am glad we had another to add to our collection.
we've had this for a year now- can't beat the price. great sound! it's still going strong!! we love it. another monitor would be nice- but we didn't really need two. if the unit isn't connecting with the base- it has a really loud alarm. that is fixed by turning it off and back on- like rebooting!  but, i usually turn this off during the day when i'm at work-  so it's no big deal.
Amazing!....after going through multiple brands of formula trying to reduce excessive spit up..turns out it was the tommy tippy bottles we were using....I never really take the time to write a review but I had to say that these were absolutely amazing.. my 5 week old has now been sleeping longer stretches through the night with out any reflux issues or gas...highly recommend these
I was given one by the hospital when my son was born and he loves it. I bought one more at the hospital's baby boutique and ordered 5 more online. Gumdrops really are the best pacifiers I have found. My son will not take any other kind of pacifier. He has to have his gumdrop. I really wish I had these when my first three where little. I couldn't get them to take a pacifier at all.
We cannot live without this for our 11 month old. It was perfect when he was younger and had trouble grasping small objects. Sometimes he doesn't even use the paci part of it, the monkey acts as enough of a &#34;security blanket&#34; for him.<br />When he was smaller, we also propped this up on his chest into his mouth when he is in his crib so it less likely to fall and roll away.
i had never heard of a wubbanub until someone gifted me with one at my baby shower. this keeps the soothie pacifier (the kind they gave at the hospital when he was born) my baby loves in his mouth and not all over the floor. it also means he isn't screaming every time it falls out! why didn't i invent this?! worth the money - i have four of them now. the animals are laos very cute.

This pacifier is awesome because you can see the little mouths at work when you look into the hole. my daughter also loved to stick her finger in the hole and chew on the sides when she was teething. Probably the best teething toy she has! the wubbanubs (pacifier attached to a small stuffed animal) are also adorable and really work with the baby's gasping reflex! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!
works great for my 15 month old, should have bought them sooner!! my son started refusing to be spoon fed at times but will take these pouches :) after a couple uses i find them easy to fill and clean and i love that i can feed my son healthy food that i have made. i hesitated to buy these and am so glad i did, they have paid for themselves in the few weeks we have been using them!
i had initially purchased a simple wishes hands free breastpump bra but returned it due to: 1. poor fit, 2. fabric lint sticking to the pump parts. as soon as i returned that one, i needed to look for a replacement that was going to work better for me. i found pumpease. it comes in pretty colors and patterns which i like. this product just works. easy to use. good fit. comfortable.
I've tried other mesh teething bags and this is by far my fav! Great colors and handle is shaped for optimal control from the baby. Love that the mesh bag comes out so you can clean it thoroughly. My 6 month old enjoyed bananas in this garden nibbler and I will continue to use it with BM ice cubes, frozen fruits for teething and stringy veggies until he's old enough to not want it.
My first born used these and we loved them. One solid piece that you don't need to worry about breaking apart. We tried the round pacifier similar to this, but it was not good. It was heavy and would fall out of his mouth when he was about to sleep, waking him up. The gum drop pacifier fit his face and is light weight. They even make a vanilla flavored one. Love gum drop pacifiers.
my wife and i love this bath sling. it allows us to have our baby in the water in a comfortable and safe manner. the mesh of the sling allows the baby to be wet from the water while keeping her in a stationary safe and comfortable position. the folding feature allows us to store it under the sink when not in use. we will have one of these as long as we have a child that will fit it.
at first, i was going to give these four stars because the plastic is a lot thinner than other stacking sets. however, the price was great and my kids use them in the sand and water table. there are holes at the bottoms of the cups and the kids love turning them upside down and seeing the air bubble out. these cups also make great number stamps to use in the sand or with play dough.
we've had this highchair/booster for about a year now and absolutely love it.  it's really sturdy and stays put in the chair.  the tray is a bit of a pain to snap on and off, but if you snap off just one side and then lift that straight up it comes right off.  it folds quick and easy, though really doesn't get small (basically the back rest folds over), but it's better than nothing!
i'd been hunting for crib mattresses for my new grandson for some time in the paper, 2nd hand stores etc. but it was hard to find one practically priced for &#34;used&#34;.  when i went on line to amazon, i was impressed with the price for a &#34;new&#34; crib mattress compared to retail purchased new.  it came within days, well packaged... i am totally satisfied with this purchase.
We love these. They were life savers during sleep training because my baby learned to put them in his mouth himself before he could easily get a plain pacifier in himself, so once he learned, we started leaving 4 in the crib every night so he can find them throughout the night and get back to sleep without our help. Also good for the car because he can easily find them without help.
I think this pacifier pod is perfect.  It holds two pacifiers and I had no issues with them being squished.  I love that it attaches to the handle of my diaper bag for easy access.  The inside of the pod is plastic, so it's totally water-proof.  It also is a great way to keep your paci's clean while you store them.  I also love the cute designs.  I definitely recommend this product.
We were losing binkies left and right, and they were the best way for my little girl to fall asleep. Cue this reasonably-priced 6-pack of her favorite style! They are very much like the green ones she was given while in the NICU, just a little bit thicker (being the 4+ month version). She doesn't seem to show any favoritism between the green newborn ones and these pink 4+ month-ers.
When my baby was about a month old, I got her this because she loves to spit her binky out constantly. I figured with it being &#34;weighted&#34; that it would help some. It did. And it was so cute to see her snuggled up to him, even out of her mouth. (Him because my husband named him 'Geoffrey' like the Toys'R'Us giraffe). We don't use it as much now that she's almost 4 months old.
I never knew these existed until I came across a baby message board & everyone was recommending them. My baby couldn't keep a regular pacifier in his mouth, they kept falling out. This was the BEST solution. Soft for them to hold onto & the perfect weight to rest on their chest while they're sleeping. Love that they're washable (no dryer, air dry). His has been bathed several times.
We got one of these pacifiers at the hospital. I was hesitant to give my newborn a pacifier since we were exclusively nursing but it helps him because he likes to comfort nurse for 20 minutes beyond feeding. We've had no issues with nipple confusion, the pacifiers are sturdy, and the lip on them helps with cleaning and retrieving without touch the part that goes in the baby's mouth.
I was pleasantly surprised when using th nuby nibbler.  I have bought similar products in the past when my other kids were younger and the kids always love them but they were hard to clean. The nibbler is so EASY to clean the way the mesh comes out and the design of the other parts makes it easy to clean throughout the whole thing. Excellent product, and I like the cover for travel.
I paid almost 7 dollars for two of them locally, and was so happy that I found this deal. I love these pacifiers and they're the only ones my daughter will use. It's unfortunate that my dog also likes them, if she can get ahold of them, so I need a lot on hand. It's also nice to have in case you lose them or they're being sterilized, etc.  Good quality. Very happy with the purchase.
Great smoothie. It's a hit and miss for my littke one. I'm a first time mom so maybe I'm still learning. Out of the other pacifiers we've (nuk and chicco),this one works the best for us. Our baby prefers this one and it's the one that our hospital provides as well. Wouldnt recommend introducing to newborns who are being breastfed until they've established their breastfeeding routine.
great product! i have family that are subconscious about their weight and they are completely embarrassed if they have to ask the flight attendant for help. it is truly a saver of pride to own your own extension. this product has been compatible with multiple airlines in and out of this country so don't worry about it not fitting your airline, it fits all the major ones i've been on.
We used Tomme Tippee bottles for my third born, my sister is now pregnant and we have gotten her all the Tommee Tippee closer to nature bottles, and now the pacifiers. I love that these make the transitions from bottle to pacifier easier, and she already loves the brand Tomme Tippee.<br /><br />I received this product at a reduced cost in exchange for my personal and unbiased review.
My son is really attached to his pacifier - these were great. I transitioned him to these from the gumdrop ones they gave us at the hospital. He's outgrowing these now at 4 months, but he is learning to manipulate his pacifier on his own so we give him these to play with. Much better for him to smash the soft rubbery ones into his face than the hard plastic Mam pacifiers he uses now!
When my grandson's old WubbaNub Monkey got befriended by the neighbor's dogs, it was a sad event. But Amazon to the rescue-and the old was replaced with a new WubbaNub monkey!! These WubbaNubs are so cute and people comment on them all the time during an outing. What a cute way to hold a pacifier. I highly recommend WubbaNubs! They are soothing for babies and very much loved by them.
i have got chicco products in the past, and they are very easy to handle, this is no exception. i got it 2 months ago for my 2 year old and i am in love with it. very smooth to travel with, easy to open and close! a little heavy than the average &#34;umbrella stroller&#34; but its defently worth it! the canopy is very large so it covers a lot, even when they are completelly lay back.
If you want to use a pacifier.  We didn't, until a trip to the ER with the third baby.  Baby was screaming and they dipped one of these in sugar water and instantly calmed him.  Needless to say, we grabbed a handful before we left the hospital and love them for quick distraction during a diaper change or to calm him down when he has gas and a full belly so doesn't need any more milk.
this belt is awesome.  it is soft and fits around my belly at the top, middle and bottom because the velcro is adjustable.  i love being able to fall asleep to the same music as my baby because they include a splitter and earbuds for me.  the belt includes 2 volume controls; 1 for baby and 1 for me.  i would recommend this product and will probably buy it for other expectant mothers.
i first heard about these from my mother-in-law.  i bought my own set because i liked them so much.  these bumpers go right under the sheet and keep your child from rolling off the bed.  for anyone who travels with their child, is transitioning their child to a big kid bed, or sends their child to grandparents for sleepovers these bumpers are a light-weight, easy to travel with must!
this has been great. we use the ice pack for teething and also for bruises/bumps. it makes the teether that much easier to find, plus the penguin is super cute. love that it's gender neutral too so if you have a boy and then pass down to a girl, it works for both genders. also- it's bpa free which is a huge relief because i am very picky about what plastics i let my daughter play with
i use it to carry my ipad, iphone, kindle, sketch book, pens, pencils and journal. i have to carry a small oxygen tank and have a problem carrying other items up and down the stairs. this serves the purpose. it is well made and has many pockets for different size items. i hope it will last a long time although i am 75 so it doesn't have to last too long. only kidding you serious ones.
Infants notoriously spit out pacifiers - it's a fact.<br />We love the Wubbanub because it positions the pacifier in such a way that my daughter can stop sucking for a moment and it does not fall out and roll away.<br />At 14 weeks old, she will now slurp on the legs, tail and head of this thing and is learning to put the pacifier back in on her own - Don't leave home without it!!! :)
this is the only pacificer my 8 month daughter will take.. it is all one piece and easy to clean.. it is true to the picture unlike someone said and it says colors vary so you cant be picky on what colors you get. luckily i got pink so i was happy but i really wouldnt have cared but they are not in stores where i live so i have to order them off amazon.. thank you for carrying them!!!
my wife and i love this gate! it's simple to install and use. we get comments from our friends all the time about how good it looks. it can be portable if you so desire, but it's really intended to be semi-permanent via four recessed cups that scew into a door frame or wall stud and hold the pressure pads in a spot of your choosing.<br /><br />overall: i highly recommend this product.
This pacifier is the only one my daughter will take. We didn't accept pacifiers at the hospital as we wanted to make sure she latched on for breastfeeding. When we came home, she wouldn't take any pacifier that I registered for. I ordered this after the great reveiw and others saying they loved the ones from the hospital. Our baby took it right away and it is a savor for soothing her!
covers so much more then the smaller types. i feel much safer in the shower since the rubber mat covers so much of the tub bottom. it was heavier then i expected but that is because it is a decent quality. it sticks well to the tub like it should and lays flat easily. i had wanted one in a prettier color but i'm glad i changed my mind and got this one i think it will last a long time.
i bought this for my husband because he loves to grill and i thought this might keep him from burning his hands taking things of the grill. he used it the first day we got it and he loves it. they are thick and are non slip. we even use it in the house so it is easier to remove stuff from the oven. we will be ordering some more of these and have recommended them to family and friends.
love this bed! i got this for a second bassinet for our house and it is perfect! i love that the entire bassinet part is made of fabric and can be completely cleaned in the washing machine quickly and easily. the colors are so cute and my little one loves the hanging toys. our baby had reflux and can't lay flat to sleep and this bed has an incline that keeps him happy while he sleeps!
This is my go to pacifier.  I have had 4 kids and tried many different pacifiers but this one has always proven true to being a great product.  It lasts unless you have a cheer (my last daughter is a chewer.) I bought these in stock because she would teeth so hard through them.  But it is a great product none of my children took any other kind of pacifier as great as they did this one.
I got the Wubbanub in the mail two days ago and I am already in love with it. This is something I wish would have been around a long time ago when I first started having kids!<br /><br />I did mistakenly by extra pacifiers thinking that they were replaceable/interchangeable, they're not. I can't complain about an assumption I made though, so I still give this wonderful product 5 stars.
My 15 year old son said these are the paci's to have for his weekend rave parties with his best friend Molly. I think it is very cute that he and his friends have parties where they act like babies listening to music until the wee hours of the morning the next day. Some good wholesome fun. Kids these days, I swear. I guess it's better than him going out and doing drugs all weekend long
I bought these after seeing that my newborn kept spitting out her pacifier(that is shaped like a bulb) because my sister in law used it with her kid and it works like magic but unfortunately my baby was used to the other paci even though she kept spitting it out and when I kept giving her this one she would just look up at me and scrunch her face. Otherwise it came just like described.
My son has always had a habit of throwing pacifiers, so chains and clips were a must.  This was one of the most sturdy and durable chains of them all, plus it's colorful and made of wood so kids can play with it as well.  Most of the other clips we had were plastic and easily broken.  My son is 12 months now and this is the only one still around from when he was born.  Great investment!
I just purchased this for my daughter who is 5 1/2 weeks old. I also bought the Tabby Kitten so we could always have 2 on hand if one of them is in the wash. I will say she handles this better than the kitten at the moment. She's still learning how to grip things and kitten actually falls out of her mouth more easily. This caterpiller stays put. Well worth the money and it's super cute!
If yer little one is not used to those plugs / binkies .. what ever it is you call them do not buy this item . The plug is stitched into the mouth of the animal of choice and is well stitched . Very nice item ! I ended up taking it apart bc my grand baby did not like how big the plug was . So if you are crafty you can swap it out for a dif one :o)) He loves it now that i have fixed it .
very durable, bright colors, relatively easy to assemble if you don't have baby brains.  read the directions if you cannot get it up or down. we obviously skipped a step. my daughter loves sleeping in it. the only negative i have is i wish the flowers that hang down were attached by buttons instead of velcro....they just fall off. i'm sure this will come in handy for many years to come!
the food jar i bought can keep food warm after a half day and is leak-proof just as introduced. i think it is also good-looking.in weekdays, my two and half year old son takes it to care center and in weekend when i take my son to museums or other playing places,i bring it with warm food, and it's very useful. today i bought another pink one and hope it is also in the same good quality.
The Soothie pacifiers bounce when dropped.  If you have ever had the frustrating experience of searching under the couch with an infant in your arms, this is the product for you!  When the WubbaNub is dropped, it stays right where it was dropped.  And, bonus, the baby has learned to keep her pacifier in with stronger suction because she often knocks it about with her little infant arms.
love this item as your typical apprehensive, cautious, and worrisome first time mom for my infant! gives you the water temperature immediately, and my five-week-old daughter enjoys looking at the light illuminating from the turtle, which remains lit for the duration of the bath, as long as it is submerged in water, serving as a distraction if ever she gets fussy. would highly recommend!
i purchased this for my nephew.  before gifting it, i wanted to listen to the songs to know what he would hear.  i liked them and thought it was great.  he is now seven months old and i just saw a picture the other day with him holding it in his hand.  i think the music is stimulating while the beads offer moving parts for even more interest.  he looked like he was enjoying it very much!
these are basic bottles, at a cheap price.  they have a slow flow nipple that vent well, the nipples are actually different colors which i thought was really cute.  i bought 3 3packs and none have leaked yet.  i always buy the [[asin:b000mqsjqo nuby 2 pack soft sipper replacement spout, clear]] for transitioning to sippies to get my money out of the bottles i buy and these fit perfectly.
Best pacifier on the market hands down! We have tried many pacifiers like the soothie (which she liked for a little while but never kept it in well) and avent pacifiers but she took to these the best. She isn't a big pacifier baby until recently as her teeth began coming in. She can keep it in her mouth well especially at night for bed time. It's easy to clean and is comfortable for her.
absolutely love this stroller so far! it maneuvers so easily, the simpelest assembly, my 3 year old has room to grow, and it is so light! folding it down is very easy as well once you figure it out the first time. i am so happy i didn't spend the extra money on a bigger brand name. i did not buy this for running or jogging so i cannot attest to that, but for errands and outings, perfect!
i gave my 4 month old granddaughter sophie for easter and they have been inseparable ever since!  my daughter says it's the only thing that seems to soothe her gums and she will not let it go.  sophie has also become her security toy.  i'm ordering another one to keep at my house--just in case!  i would highly recommend her![[asin:b000idslog vulli sophie the giraffe teether]] is amazing!
Always ben a fan of tomme tippee  seens my girl 4 yrs ago now am goin to have a baby boy so i decided to keep with tomme tippee brand  i love the new products and changes they made to some products  these are different shape then what i buy to my girl  really cute  cant wait to see my baby with them i love them how cute they are greeat quality as always and much softer then others brands
I love love love WubbaNub's. We have seven babies in my family and they all have different ones. This one was for my son. He is no longer using binkies but this was the only one he would take ever! We called him Nigel :) Great things for baby to hold onto and very easy to wash! I always just put mine in the dishwasher! Over about 16ish months I bought 3 or 4 of them but totally worth it!
Santa brought this for my 3 month baby and I'm so glad he did!  She loves her green binky and is just starting to grasp onto toys/snuggle with soft toys.  This combination of the two makes for a perfect thing for her.  I've seen some of the other Wubbanubs and some of them are just ugly.  This one is so cute though - the face on the little lamb is adorable and it's velour-soft.  Love it.
my grandson is a handful.  he likes to run around in public places, and short of carrying him everywhere, i have no way to keep him by my side.  this safety strap allows him to run around, but not too far.  he has the freedom to walk, which makes him happy, and i keep him close, which makes me happy.  it has saved my back, and saved us from having to chase him.  it's the perfect product.
i read a bunch of reviews before decided to buy these nursing pads.  so happy i did!  they're comfortable, soft, wash well in the machine, they're a great choice.  i used coconut oil on my nips after each feeding when we were getting started & i haven't had any cracks or bleeding.  i think the combo of the oil & these pads saved me from the pain i've heard about from so many other women!
It took a lot of trial and error to find a pacifier that my daughter would take and she took the Soothies right away with no problems.  I just found these and ordered them from the company's website since they have the same nipple as the Soothies.  I LOVE them!  My daughter takes them with no problems and I love that they don't bump her nose with every suck.  And they look so much cuter!
everything about this cart cover is very good, except that it is a bit bulky, which i knew it would be but it would be better if they had made it just half as bulky, but then it probably wouldn't be as comfortable.  the elmo part doesn't really excite my 8 month old but it is very cute. i don't like all the other ones out there with a bunch of patterns on it, like some grandma's curtains.
This has been the only binky that my daughter likes. We have gotten all 3 stages of it so far and have been very happy with it. They have stood up to many many cleanings without breaking down. It is also large enough that choking is less of a concern. The back also allows my daughter to grab the pacifier and also to easily attach a strap when she is in the stroller so it doesn't get lost.
These are my baby's favorite. They're not too long so he doesn't gag on them like some others I've tried. My first baby would take pretty much any pacifier, but my second is much pickier and will only take this kind. Definitely the easiest to wash out of all of them.<br /><br />Only negative: the nub does make it easy for him to knock out of his own mouth with his flailing hands and arms.
i purchased this glider to have when my granddaughter comes to visit. it is very easy to assemble and can be  folded up for travel situations. i thought that it would go through batteries quickly because it requires 4 d batteries. i have used about 8 times and it is still going strong. even with the glider going and the overhead toys turning and music playing; can't beat it for the price.
this doll is exactly what i wanted for my daughter's first dolly. it is adorable, perfect size, light, very soft, durable, and the hair is divinely soft. she isn't cheap looking at all.<br />i am so glad i chose this doll for my daughter's first birthday after looking at all the dolls and being on the fence for a long time. my daughter loves her and carries her easily around all the time.
this pacifier has truly saved my life! my daughter loves that there is something to play with for extra comfort, and I love how much easier it is to find around the house. the reason I bought it was because of the fact that my daughter wakes up looking for her pacifier. with the extra weight, it stays in her mouth better and she gets a better night sleep. I would recommend this to anyone!
We have been through 3 different types of pacifiers MAM, traditional with the tilted nipple and the Soothie. Baby A has constantly spit out every pacifier besides the MAM, Baby B really is not that picky but he too holds onto this pacifier as if it was golden breast milk lol.<br /><br />The air is perfect for teething babies as well, I'm not even sure I want to try any other type of MAMs.
i purchased this as a baby gift for my grandson and my daughter just loves it she does not have any negative comments at all. sure wish there was these products when i had my children.  the screen is very clear and the sound is great.  all in all a great product and would recommend it.[[asin:b004e9swq2 angelcare 4 piece baby video sound and movement baby monitor system ac1100, gray/white]]
This is a great pacifier. I purchased this right before the birth of my little girl and she has been using it since the first day she was born. Its easy to find if its dropped. She loves the softness and print of the giraffe. Its super easy to wash as it is machine washable. I recommend this to everyone. I've purchased another one for a friend since we love it so much. You won't regret it.
babies spend a lot of time on their mattresses for many many years during childhood. consequently, we felt like it was worthwhile  getting a decent mattress and so purchased the moonlight slumber starlight support mattress which is amazing. with a nice mattress a mattress cover is a must as \\accidents happen.\\ this is a nice mattress cover. it is soft and fits snugly. no problems so far.
I bought this cute Binkibear for my 4-M-old son and he fell in love with Binki as soon as he saw it!! He really enjoys cuddling with Binki and plays with it. I even found my son rolling on the bed and still holding it in his arm!LOL The only thing I didn't satisfy is my son doesn't like the pacifier attached on Binki, but I think it's not a big deal, I can buy other pacifier to replace it.
The AVENT Soothie pacifer is awesome. We got our in the hospital and my baby has been using them ever since. He is 15 mths old now and still using the 0-3 mths paci (now only for nap time). We tried the ones for older babies but he prefers the 0-3 mth one. The only con I would say is that it can not be clipped to a paci holder... although I did here they are now making some of them to fit.
My daughter loves her elephant.  She can handle it on her own and likes to chew on the stuffed part while holding the pacifier part.  It makes it easier to find in her carseat when she drops it which makes car rides quieter.  It's a little expensive, but I would buy another one for the ease of finding it when she drops it.  If your child likes the soothie pacifiers, I would recommend this.
unfortunately we're not able to set up my daughters crib at the moment so i've had her in the playpen. she would not sleep at all on just the pad (i don't blame her, it's really hard!). so, we decided to give this mattress a try and she absolutely loves it! i was afraid it was going to be too tough but it's actually a little soft. now my 2 month old sleeps right on through the night on it!
These are great, and my grandson loves them!  There is an entire menagerie of animals to choose from, but be aware that there are two different age groups for the pacifiers.  I would think that the added weight of the animal would be a problem, but so far it it not.  It makes it easier for parents to hold on to, also, and it doesn't fall out of baby's mouth so easily when they're sleeping.
These are the best pacifiers I've ever purchased! It has a great, solid base (for when my daughter is teething) and orthodontic nipple for soothing/naptime. I love that there is nowhere for air or saliva to get trapped, making these one of the most sanitary pacifiers you can have! They are definitely more expensive that the kind you'll find in Target, but I think they're worth every penny.
when i bought this chair i though it was expensive, but now that i have use it i love it!!! is really comftrable and my baby do not cry any more... we can go for hours and he is happy finally he is able to move his head, arms and legs without any problem... i strongly recomend this chair for any one, my baby is 5 months old and this chair is rear facing and front facing and is fantastic...
This is so soft and lovely. It's perfect for the baby to hold on to and then snuggle at the same time. A baby that can reach for things can find it easily in the crib at night. I wish the pacifier came in a larger size for older babies, although, I have found, that my baby is not picky to the little difference in the size. I wouldn't let that deter a parent of an older baby to try this out.
works great.  i always buy these!  i am a dog sitter, so i use mine quite a lot.  i watch pretty big dogs.  so after a while, they obviously wear out, but i keep buying them because before they wear out, they work great.  you don't have to put any holes in your walls.  you can put it between walls or a doorway or whatever & it stays tight so dogs can't get through.  it's also a nice height.
When my son was born we used our Pack-n-Play as our bassinet. However, he would not sleep well in it. My husband and I thought he was just not a good sleeper. However, at 4 weeks old we moved him to the crib. He has been sleeping through the night ever since. He looks soooo comfortable in his crib at night. I am so thankful that we bought this mattress. It certainly has made my life easier!
Like other reviewer, my son is not really into using a pacifier. Instead he uses this mostly as a teether, occasionally sucking.  He flips it around using the loop and the edges to teeth. I feel better knowing what it is made of and not finding out later on that it has a plastic product that only later was seen to cause problems. So far it has lasted through two teeth with no wear and tear.
I bought this for my niece when she was born.  She loves it!  She had to be under the light while in the hospital.  My sister couldn't hold her and the baby wanted physical touch.  She would cry if someone wasn't touching her.  When we gave her this she quieted immediately.  She loved the way it felt on her tummy.  Now she is 8 months old and still this is her go-to binki!  And it's so cute!
i absolutely love this! my little guy was constantly resting his feet on the back of the seat, which would always lead to kicking. since using this product he has stopped. i also like that it is easy to install. i recently switched car seats and it easily adapted to the new seat. i would recommend this product to all parents or anyone who cares for children that are in a car seat or booster.
Our lactation consultant recommended these over the Soothies, as they maintain better habits. I'm not 100% sure what she means by that, but the kid loves these and took to them almost immediately. They are all one piece which makes for easy cleaning, and you can see through them and be amused by the sucker fish face the kid makes when using them. Selling these in multi-packs is a great idea.
Baby looks adorable using it, and it does what it's supposed to - it pacifies a baby.  Worth the buy just for the cute factor.    Now that she is grabbing, she will occasionally take hold of the stuffed-animal part and pull it out of her mouth.  That's your only look-out on this item.  You want to stay close by till the baby's asleep, so you can pop it back in her mouth if she tugs it loose.
These are excellent pacifiers that held up well and were the only kind my super colicky baby would take. Also, they aren't terribly expensive, so we were able to stock up. Being able to stick your finder in the sucking area is helpful in getting the baby to take it and is great for freezing water in when your little one is teething (which happened at 2 1/2 months for us). Highly recommended!
My son had to have testing done in the hospital and these things kept him calm through the nine hours of it.  They are great.  I wish I would have known about these from the beginning.  If you are cleaning them I suggest soap and hot water.  I boiled 2 and they lost most of the smell.  The nurses told me the smell should last about a month, and it seems to.  These are wonderful for soothing.
We've used the Wubbanub pacifier since our child was a newborn. He loves to cuddle with the stuffed animal. Now that he's older, he easily puts the paci back in his mouth. He also loves to chew on the toy as well. It's so easy to wash and I love that I can throw it in a mesh laundry bag in the washer. We have been using the pacifier with the lamb and decided that we definitely need a second!
I bought the dog when my little girl was born. Yes pricey but if you think about it, you are getting two in one. A snuggle friend for infants small enough to not worry about it smothering your little one and a soothie. I got the lamb for my little prince. It arrived faster than it was suppose to and packed well. Of course i will be buying more. They are adorable and my two month old loves it
Bought this three years ago for my little girl as a newborn who didnt like pacifiers at all and she loved it. Hard to miss place with the toy attached as without it can get buried under her in the carseat or in the baby bag. Now that she is older she plays with the toy part with the pacifier disattached. Ordering the lamb for my newest addition as a xmas stocking stuffer. A must have product
this is a very quality item and i am sooo happy i ordered it. we have a play yard that has the top part turn into a basinet for baby to sleep in. obviously it came with just a plain cover and i couldn't imagine having a baby sleep on that...so we ordered this and it's sooooooo soft and kind of thick so it gives a little padding for baby. highly recommend. i ordered the pink and it's perfect!
Would have liked to have this for my first two kids!  Got it for my third, just as he quit using a pacifier, of course!  None of our kids used the pacifier much over two months, but for those two months, it's nice to have any extra help you can get!  He doesn't use a pacifier now at 8 months, but I keep this in the diaper bag for him anyway.  He's teething and likes to have stuff to chew on!
i purchased this blanket for my now 4 year old before she was born.  the blanket is very soft and was perfect for a newborn, and my daughter still uses it to wrap and cover up her baby dolls. this blanket has withstood countless trips through the washing machine and dryer and still shows practically no signs of wear.  i'm very happy with this purchase and would highly recommend this blanket.
My wife hates the thought of me ever using this but I can't wait.  The quality seems good and it is dentist approved supposedly (there is some type of standard on that) so my wife can't stop this on that basis, the only thing she threatened was to throw it out but I said I'd just buy another so I think I鈥檓 good to go.  I'll update this if my newborn hates it when she gets to actually use it.
Our son received his first red dog wubbanub paci while in the NICU and after he was released later I soo understood why the nurses loved these pacifiers. My son who just turned 4 months old is not a great paci sucker even though he likes to fall asleep with it, but his Wubbanub helps him by staying in place! I just love that they are very easy to find...havent lost one yet!..and he has three!
a must have for potty trainees.  we have extras, so we can easily swap out the piddlepad after an accident.  i've heard of parents using plastic bags, etc.  this is so much easier and very inexpensive. they run easily through the wash too and air dry in no time.  my daughter calls it her \\mat\\ and thinks she's special to have it.  i can't imagine she'd feel the same about a plastic bag. . .
i like this style and brand the best. i have tried many and have a drawer full to prove it. this material is machine washable which is nice b/c some are not. dries quickly, hang/line dry. this also covers chest, belly, and shoulders. by putting the arms through the arm slots it prevents it from shifting. plus it has a longer front with a pocket so it catches most food and keeps the lap clean.
I never used a pacifier for my daughters, but since I can't get in the back to comfort my son on car trips I decided to introduce a pacifier. He wasn't thrilled with the ones commonly sold in stores, so I did a little research and found that breast fed babies tend to accept this one, with the vanilla scent.<br /><br />It being clear, it's kind of fun to watch his little mouth sucking on this.
i got this for my daughter-in who just had my grandgirl. she's only had it for a few weeks and loves it. what makes it extra nice is it comes with a brush. the basket holds bottle nipples, smaller bottles, baby spoons, medicine cups. anything small that you wouldn't want to disappear. fill it up, put it in dishwasher, after it's clean, take out. everything she puts in the basket is protected.
We have 3 children and this is the first pacifier that has been enjoyed by a baby in our home. Our son chews on all sides of it.  It has a delightful Simpsons look to it when in use. We have had each size gradation and they really do change a lot. I LOVE this one. If he rolls on it at night, it's soft. I really can't say enough good about it.  I love that it's BPA free and all natural rubber.
This is a must have for my son. We have also purchased the lamb, monkey and giraffe but this one is my favorite. It seems more solid in size and unlike the giraffe, there are no parts that make it difficult for a baby to use (I.e. the neck of the giraffe makes it hard for a child to keep in their mouth). The color of the bull also hides stains that don't come out in the wash and overall, cute!
i have my own stories about this monitor waking us up when our baby was not breathing, but i have to add that this monitor uses four regular aaa nimh (nickel-metal hydride) batteries. it's been three years now, and it's time to get a new set of batteries. we don't have to buy some special, proprietary battery available only from the manufacturer. i continue to be very happy with this purchase!
finally someone has made a decent looking, durable toddler seat.  this is not the seat for you if you've got a child that requires restraint or needs the seat to be stably attached to a chair/stool but if you have an older toddler who really just needs the &#34;boost&#34; you can't go wrong with this one.  cushion comes off for easy cleaning and back folds down for convenient, compact storage.
i always eyed this rattle in the baby toy aisle, but was skeptical it was worth $4. found it for 50垄 and decided to get it, and i wish i had never hesitated! my 3.5 month old grips the cross-style body easily and it has quickly become one of his favorite toys. the mirror side makes the balls seem to glow and always catches eye. this and his take along tunes have been his diaper-bag-must-haves.
*i received this product free in exchange for an honest review*<br />this was easy to use, easy to fill up and worth using. the comfort and versability of this product is great. for sitting, excercising and more, this helped with back pain and more. the ball provides support with excersices or for sitting. the little legs on the ball make it easier to use. this is great for any pregnant woman.
This pacifier is perfect! It is a great comfort knowing my son's teeth are not being pushed on (as much). He took it without a problem and liked it for the short amount of time we got to use it. He decided he didn't want any pacifiers anymore about 1 week after I purchased it. I don't think this pacifier played a role in him deciding that. Overall, it is a great product and would recommend it.
The feeder is just the right size for the baby mouth, easy for him to hold. The silicone food pouch maintains it's shape even when not full and does not flop around like mesh feeders do. The holes are just big enough for tiny food pieces to go through without the danger of choking. It's perfect for meet, fruit and veggies. My son likes to drop everything on the floor so the clip or very handy.
this is the second davinci crib i have purchased in the last 2 years...both as gifts for my 2 grandchildren. this is a superior product for the price and looks beautiful.  the crib we bought 2 years ago is still holding up and looks brand new.  my daughter in nc loves it! the second crib is waiting for baby to arrive, but my daughter in michigan loves the look in the nursery. excellent product!
My 7 month old daughter loves her wubbanubs! We keep one in each crib. She cuddles and plays with the little animal while she pacifies herself. The attached animal makes it easy for her to find her binky in the dark, so Mom and Dad can sleep. :)  These are great. And inexpensive enough to have one at home, daycare, and Grandma's!  Besides being practical, they are very cute!!! Highly recommend!
We love these pacifiers, and more importantly, our little one loves these pacifiers. They are the only ones he will not spit out. I love the bright colors, too, as they are easy to find. My only complaint would be that the colors vary so you can't pick which you want. We have lucked out on colors each time, between gender neutral and boy colors, not that a pink pacifier is the end of the world!
My twins will only take the soothie pacifiers but they don't stay in very well. These are the perfect solution. We have a red dog, penguin, puppy and this bull. They are easy for tiny hands to hold onto. They are also great for younger babies to find and put the pacifier back in their mouths on their own at a much earlier age. My babies also love the comfort of the stuffed animal. We love them.
I ordered some pacifiers from Personalized Pacifiers online and they are the only ones my daughter will take now. We needed a few extras to have in the diaper bag, car and bed so we ordered this one and a couple others. I LOVE this paci, we get so many compliments on it that I'm going to order another one as a back up. We've even sterilized it and the Zebra print didn't fade or wash off at all!
These are the only pacifiers that our baby liked and can keep in her mouth. I know a lot of people don't like how they have to be right side up, but that never really bothered us. Not only does the picture show which way is up, the shape of the paci itself is another indicator. Sometime our baby puts it in herself upside down, but it doesn't bother her... or she'll turn it the other way herself.
Can't live without these. All of my kids were born &#34;tongue-tied&#34; and conventional stubby plugs never worked, they refused to use them. These are the only pacifiers my 3 kids would take. I think the length of the nipple is easier for a baby who has difficulty latching, where the conventional plugs are too short. A true in-the-store-at-midnight-cuz-you-lost-the-last-one kind of saving buy!
i ordered this ladybug for my 4-year-old daughter who is afraid of the dark.  i wanted something to give a little light in her room, but not so bright that she wouldn't be able to sleep.  this night light is perfect.  the stars give just enough light, and the timer is great.  we keep the light on as she falls asleep, and then it turns off automatically after 45 minutes.  we love this nightlight!
My baby loves her wubbanubs! Easy for her to put back in her mouth if it falls out and easy for us to see so it does not get lost. She's 3 months old and she loves to hold on to her puppy. (Had a giraffe...RIP... our dog got a hold of it which would be the only con...because the dog loves it too) just ordered her a bunny wubbanub so she can have an extra! Would definitely recommend this product.
This pacifier is worth it's weight in gold. It's genius!  The little giraffe helps to keep the pacifier close to my daughters mouth even if she spits it out, so she is able to put it back in instead of needing to cry for me.<br /><br />At night I put this on her tummy, and so when she wakes her pacifier is right there to help her back to sleep immediately!!<br /><br />A must have for any parent.
This product is great!  My son loves it and it is easy for him to find in the middle of the night.  He also tends to throw his pacifiers out of the crib before going to sleep, so this one is easy to find and put back in the crib because it doesn't bounce.  The people at my son's daycare love it too!  Everyone has a similar pacifier and it is hard to mark them...this one is a one of a kind there.
I've gone through many pacifiers over the years and these are top notch! The handle is ideal as it's very important to know where the pacifier is at all times so I always seem to slip it on my finger like a ring if not in use. There is no water getting inside from saliva, etc and that makes it feel much cleaner and more sterile. Soft silicone seems to be easy to suck on and keep the babies happy!
best money i ever spent on a baby gate. we used this pen for over a year from the time my daughter began walking till she was old enough to figure out how to climb out. it is large and roomy so she always had a lot of space to play and it held up great. it was wonderful for when i needed to cook in the kitchen as i could watch her easily while she played in her pen. highly recommend this product.
these pouches are surprisingly easy to clean. the seal is tight and my toddler has yet discovered how to open them - i doubt he could if he tried. this is a great, mess-free way to get little babies/toddlers to eat food that you otherwise wouldn't let them eat on their own without making a mess (i.e yogurt, applesauce, pur茅es). my son takes it to preschool and it always comes back empty. love it!
Love these.  My daughter wanted to play with her pacifier, but at 8 weeks, didn't quite have the coordination to keep track of such a small object.  We bought her this, and she loves it.  We had to buy 2 more to keep around the house/in the car.  They're also great because it's hard to lose a stuffed animal, as opposed to just a pacifer.  Great for in the car. Recommend them to all of our friends.
my 17 month old son loves to walk around stores with me but he's not great at remembering to hold my hand. this solves the problem and it's discreet enough that i don't get as many nasty looks as i would if i put him in a traditional kid harness/leash. it's a great tool for teaching him to remember to hold hands and it gives him the freedom to get out of the cart or carriage and explore the world.
This pacifier is great for not only soothing your little one, but also giving them something tactile to hang on to or play with. Also, the feet are weighted slightly, helping your baby keep the pacifier in place on their chest until they can hang onto it themselves. As a final plus, the stuffed animal makes finding the pacifier a lot easier when it falls out of the car seat or crib! Great product!
this swing is absoultely the best thing you can buy in terms of your baby loving spending time in it to giving you time to get things done around the house.  the motion is nice and gentle and the swing can swing in different directions.  plus, with the papasan seat it's easy to get your baby in and out of it.  of all the baby things my husband and i purchased, this one is worth its weight in gold.
Mam is our favorite brand for pacifiers and bottles! Something about the high-quality material and shape of nipples makes them great. The glow in the dark aspect of these are the best - I'm nearly blind without contacts, so searching for a paci in the dark while being blind is a bad combo. I can see these bad boys glowing from a few feet away, making them easy to grab and pop back in baby's mouth.
This was the only pacifier that would stay in because it would lie on his tummy and because he wasn't rolling it would stay in.  He has this one and the puppy. The puppy looks cuter than the monkey in my opinion - but both have served their purpose and get a lot of comments from people too. Very cute. Easy to wash - just throw in the washing machine. Very happy with these and definitely recommend.
we bought this bed for our second child. i don't think she's old enough to appreciate it yet, but the bed pleases us. it is surprisingly well built, the paint doesn't come off so easily like our first child's bed. (i tried to peel back a small section on the underside) all in all it is a well crafted bed. it's rigid and sturdy. the colour is true to the photo in the listing. we're pleased with it.
My daughter has loved her lamb WubbaNub. It was easy for her to grab when she was younger and it didn't bounce all around when it fell on the floor. She is 20 months now and just uses it at night to help her get to sleep. Per the warnings on it you need to be careful once they have teeth as if they use it as a teether (as my daughter began to do) the end will break off and can be a choking hazard.
i love this product.  i bought this to use for my little 3 month old daughter while she had a very bad cold, and i was so relieved to be able to help her!  initially, i was mortified by the concept, but when your baby is suffering and uncomfortable, you'll do anything to help them.  nothing from your baby's nose comes in contact with you in any way.  bottom line - it works, and it works very well.
i only use this bottle warmer on trips, and i \\never leave home without it!!\\  it is perfect with my avent bottles, and heats perfectly every time according to directions.  i have the finicky baby who needs her bottle warm, and i used to run it under the hot water forever while she was crying.  now it's a breeze. and it's so fast.  i can hold her and she watches it heat!  happy baby, happy mommy.
my son started teething and he needed something to help relieve it. the package arrived quickly and i put it on him as soon as we got home. by the next morning i notice a difference in his behavior. he still drools and likes to chew on things but not nearly as much as he was before. his overall fussiness had improved as well. the necklace was of very high quality and i love the way it looks on him.
we love these bibs! so easy to clean and ready for use again! not bulky though sometimes awkward with small babies. perfect for about 8-9 mos and up. perfect for restaurants because you can put them back in your bag clean. no more washing bibs in the laundry or waiting for bibs to cycle back through, or having a huge stack, just wipe and put back on the hi chair for next time. definitely recommend.
worth every dollar!! my baby boy loves it,and i have more time to do things while he plays in it(i think we all moms can agree that we sometimes don't even have time to eat,soo it is so important that baby can play  by himself).  i also put lot of his toys on the table so its more interesting for him.we bought it when he was 5 months old and now his 8 months,you can adjust the seat when baby grows.
so far i love it! definitely like it better than the nosefrida one that i had before. love the carrying case(so convenient), the soft tip for the baby's nose, how small it is, no filters needed, and its easy peasy to clean. i am planning on buying this as a baby shower gift for all the new mamas :) and probably one more for myself(so i can have one for the diaper bag and one on the changing table).
this carseat is the perfect size and width to fit in most planes - we used ours on an alaskan air flight.  the person in front of our daughter was able to recline her seat with no problems.  this seat can be used in the airplane without needing the base...so that's one less thing to carry.  not too much cushioning when you compare it to our snugride 35, but my daughter didn't notice the difference.
this is the perfect first book! i purchased this for my 9 month old granddaughter for christmas with the hope that her interest in books would begin early. she's very attracted to the vibrant colors and picks it up often to look through it. after reading the book, we go back through it and i name all the colors and make up more stories about each of the very cute characters and other illustrations.
we love this monitor! especially because it lets us know the temp in our child's room, which really came in handy the other night when our heater went out. we also love the two way communication. now when our child wakes up in the middle of the night, i am able to soothe her back to sleep without even leaving my bed. wish we bought this one a long time ago. we had a summer video monitor & it broke.
My daughter loves this (when she's in the mood for a pacifier, that is). The dragon is adorable, and helps keep her pacifier in place in the car when she gets fussy. There are definitely cheaper wubbanubs, but my husband and I decided that if we were going to stare at it a lot, it was worth paying extra for the special edition dragon. And now that I have it in hand, I know we made the right choice!
i got this when my baby was 4month old..its her favorite chew toy! i give to her and she just chews every where! ring part and leafy part! with her wabbly and not stable grabbing technic this is such a perfect toy for her! thank you for all the amazon reviewrs who highly recommand this! it stops her fussyness and thats so much more than i asked for! great product just amazed what little toy can do!
We had the giraffe WubbaNub until my older child misplaced it so we ordered the Brown Puppy as a back up (we ironically found the giraffe the day this one came!). My baby love this binky just as much as the giraffe - they are the only two binkies he'll take. They are also harder to lose and easy for the baby to grab and manipulate themselves. We recommend WubbaNubs to all of our new parent friends.
we were having a hard time getting our daughter to take a bath...we had tons of bath toys, but i purchased these and bathtime is fun again! she loves them and she wants to take a bath now! a great purchase and i would highly recommend buying a bath tub toy bag to store them in...once we put them in the bag they dry off by themselves and i don't have to worry about them getting dry. a great purchase.
I ordered a spare Wubanub for my 1 yr. old Grand daughter to have when she sleeps over at our house.  This is the only pacifier she uses and only when she goes to sleep.  She quickly finds it in her crib and doesn't need to have 5 pacifiers in there with her.  . It is soothing like a normal pacifier but also soothing in a tactile way.  It goes perfectly with her Lovey which is an Angel Dear Blankie.
excellent bathrobe- exactly as advertised, and more so. my wife ordered three different animal robes for gifts and they were a huge hit. soft, comfortable, and most important, great quality. also, unlike some products, the bathrobes actually looked like the picture, which is what we were hoping for. this will be our go-to-gift for all newborns/babies. you will not be sorry if you order this product.
The SkinSafers works well for my little boy.  His knees were always scrapped, scratched and bruised.  With this product his knees are protected and so is his clothes.  I like the one size fits all so that we were able to use them when he first started crawling and then later when he was walking and running around.  I no longer have to fear for my child when he starts running on pavement or concrete!
what a fun night light for kids of all ages.  casts nice starts and the moon on the ceiling and auto turns off during the night.  the buttons are big so an older child could turn back on easily if he/she woke in the night.  my 20 month old loves it, we lie on the floor and give it lots of \\wows\\.  plus its battery powered so when you travel you don't have to worry about where it can be plugged in.
this thing is a life saver. the way it can attach to so many different things is so great! people are always asking me about it. i put it on the car seat and it really helps calm the baby. the music is nice, not too annoying or too loud, which is often an issue with these things.  there is also a setting where it spins without the music which is useful in places it needs to be quit. highly recommend.
We have the dino version of this and my son loves it so we thought we'd get one more of a different style. These are good because it's a pacifier and a plush all in one.  During the night if he wakes up its easy for him to find in the dark and grab onto to put back in his mouth and go right back to sleep. Worth it's weight in gold to a sleep deprived parent!<br />Note: It's Machine washable, air dry.
we purchased this monitor after having tried a mobicam monitor which we returned after learning that the camera could not be moved to view our son. we have been incredibly pleased with this monitor, and use it all the time to check on our son - we even take it with us when we travel. the setup is easy and convenient, and several of our friends have purchased the monitor after seeing how nice ours is!
i have a variety of cups for my 1 year old in the cupboard. since lids keep breaking or a dog keeps chewing on the lids i've had to buy more cups. these cups are amazing! my son got once for his birthday which is what made me want to buy more of these kind of cups. they don't leak, my one year old can hold it, and they have great characters on them. they are by far my favorite cups for my son to use.
received this item last week.  easy to install.  used them on our new bar counter top.  in the 2 weeks that we lived in the house, we had 1 accident and 3 near misses with our children running around in the house.  this has made the corners very soft, just incase they get too close again.  the color is a little lighter that what i had thought it would be, but it still blends in with our counter tops.
The WubbaNub is a must have whenever I put together a baby shower gift! I have yet to meet a baby that doesn't fall in love instantly with their WubbaNub! The design allows them to cuddle a soft, squishy stuffed toy while getting comfort from their binky at the same time. I find that with WubbaNubs you end up with much less of the pacifier being thrown on the floor too. They don't want to give it up!
cannot say enough positive things about this product!  it was a lifesaver for my daughter and my sanity.  she had reflux and laying on her back, she would never sleep longer than 5 minutes; in the rock n' play she would sleep 5 hours a night from 2-3 weeks old.    i would highly recommend this to anyone from birth to 3 months!  my daughter used this instead of a crib until she was almost 4 months old.
This was the pacifier they gave me in the hospital and I was happy to find them on Amazon. I was given some of the First Years gumdrop pacifiers as baby shower gifts - same concept as these.  Both work great, however, the Avent Soothie is softer.  I use both and like both. The price on Amazon was basically the same as I have seen in local retail stores, but got it as an add-on item with free shipping.
My daughter wouldn't have any pacifier and would only suck her bottle tit , that made her eat more then she needed afterwards she would spit it all out  but cry as she wanted to suck . I found this pacifier on internet and i, m so happy , she took it from the first moment and loves it . Easy to wash , doesn't hurt even if it falls under their had or body , only thing i would have liked if it had cover
I love this tiger! It has the same pacifier that my boy had while in the hospital, so there was no &#34;getting used to&#34; it. The Tiger is super cute.  My only wish is that it were a little heavier. .. My 12 day old knocks it out of his mouth with the slightest movement of his arms.  I haven't had to wash it yet but my cousin has the same one and had washed it plenty of times and it looks like new.
this necklace was purchased for a 7 month old baby boy that was drooling so bad that he was literally soaking 3-5 bibs a day simply with drool.  2 days after putting this necklace on him the drool has almost completely stopped and he is no longer wearing bibs to catch drool all day long.  i will be the first to tell you that i was a skeptic...but this product works and i am in awh of what it has done.
i've used this for my son while we've been out at the doctor's office and shopping.  my son is 2 1/2 and in the middle of potty training.  i wasn't sure if he'd sit on a big toilet without a seat, but with these potty toppers he was happy to sit there.  i was happy to have him sit there too because the topper covered up a lot of the seat so he didn't have to touch it.  overall really like the product.
this is a very cute backpack. although it does not offer a lot of room. though it serves the purpose i need it for very easily. i am going on a plane with two toddlers, and decided to get them one of each of these bags to put a couple of toys, and a (small sized) blanket, and it all fits in there. snug, i admit. but the bag is super cute. i will probably use them as a lunch bag when they start school.
loved giving this Gift Box- it is really great as a baby shower gift and packaged well!<br /> the blanket is extra soft as well as the teddy bear , looks just like the pics , my friend said she uses all the products and are all very useful . great for those who don't have the time to run to the store and select each item. very good value for money.always a bit worried to buy online but this was bingo.
my 1 and 2 yr old absolutely love their stars.  before we leave their rooms at night they both ask for theirs stars.  also my 2 yr old was a nightmare he would get out of bed all night and fuss or play but with his stars now he stays in bed.  these stars actually light up their whole ceiling and parts of their walls too and their rooms arent tiny so i love that, i highly recommend this for toddlers :)
We purchased the monkey Wubbanub for our son when he was six weeks old.  It has become such a staple in our lives that we thought we had better get a back up because our lives would be VERY difficult if we should ever lose monkey!  We purchased the lion Wubbanub and he loves it just as much.  It's cute because he likes to hold onto his mane while he's sucking away.  This thing is a lifesaver, trust me!
this crib is gorgeous! so worth the price, sturdy, and will serve us for years to come. it was a little confusing to put together as the directions are not super clear but we had a friend who is a pro come and help my husband set it up. other reviews said it smelled of paint but i did not have this problem and we let it sit in the box for weeks before putting it all together. 100% happy with this crib!
I am extremely satisfied with this purchase! These glow in the dark pacifiers have really made my life as a new Mom a lot easier. My son would wake up in the middle of the night because he was looking for his pacifier in his crib. Now when he wakes up he is able to see the pacifier and grab it since it glows in the dark. I would recommend these to any parent whose baby uses a pacifier during the night.
Purchased these for our new baby that should be coming in November. We plan to take them to the hospital with us to use. We received some from the hospital with our first daughter, but since moving overseas and now giving birth at a military hospital we found out they discourage bottle feeding and pacifiers and won't provide these. Our first daughter loved it so we decided to get a set for our new one.
great product! my son used this product on a recent car trip and he loved it! it is super high quality for the price and is the perfect size pillow for toddlers and small children! i would highly recommend this to parents looking for a small people for their little one to travel with, take to daycare or preschool, or any other occasion. this product was also shipped very fast and was packaged very well!
this is the greatest invention.  ever.  as a new mom the idea of taking my baby's temperature the &#34;old fashioned&#34; way completely freaked me out but I never feel like the under the arm method is as accurate as it should be.  then this came along and I can't imagine not having it.  we have already used it and it's perfect! I ordered two so that my sister-in-law and mommy-to-be never has to worry!!
five stars aren't enough for this pillow! i have arthritic problems with my neck and shoulders, painful enough to wake me up at night. after a failed search for a pillow that would be firm enough to provide support yet soft enough to be comfortable, i bought this one, and from the first night, it was perfect. slept through the night and woke up pain-free. a big &#34;thank you&#34; to the dreamtown kids!
Just had twin grandchildren and grandmothers have to keep things like this around.  Not much I can say about pacifiers.  I considered trying one out but my wife vetoed the idea.  They do look like excellent quality and were delivered quite rapidly.  Great that they come in multiple colors so grandmother can remember which infant uses which pacifier.  Let's be honest here, she'll still get them mixed up.
My little granddaughter used these from the start with no hesitation. At 6lbs 8ounces the small was perfect for her. We opted for the round and since she is a nursing baby we wanted to reduce nipple variations. I would recommend these, we were very attracted to the fact that there aren't any grooves were bacteria could live and grow. Also the fact that it is a natural product, rubber from a rubber tree.
This is my husband's account but I had to come on and give a review. These pacifiers are great! They are hard to lose because of their size. Our daughter who is almost 5 months old is starting to learn how to guide it to her mouth because its big enough for her to  grab. She also uses the rim of the pacifier to chew on because she's teething so that's an added bonus in my book! I would highly recommend.
My baby's ONLY pacifiers...  They actually STAY IN!!  Even when they are little.  And as they grow older, there is much more for them to grab onto.  Couldn't live without.  And I am sure that this will be my little one's lovie...  At almost 5 months she loves to hold onto it for comfort whether or not it is in her mouth.  Had to buy a second recently as a back up because don't ever want to be without...
This product arrived promptly and my 1 month old has loved it ever since.  It is much easier to keep up with this paci with the giraffe attached!  We use it during the day when he is being supervised.  I read reviews about people letting their kids sleep with them but I am too scared.  I worry he will try to eat the giraffe or something (I'm probably being ridiculous).  Anyway, great product and SO CUTE.
i was very please with this gift. i bought it for a friends daughter when her baby was being christened. he loved it so much that they actually brought it to the christening and he was grabbing it during the ceremony which  of course meant a lot to me. they said it seemed to make him  settle down and not cry. i liked it so much i bought another to keep on hand for the next christening of a friends child.
i actually ordered a much cheaper high-chair ($100) and they took over 10 days to ship it so i cancelled and ordered this once. i'm so glad. it's not too cheap but the price is great for a chair your kid will be using for some years! cleans up so easily, shipped super fast, it has wheels and i push it everywhere so easily and i love the print! i love the huge tray it comes with and also the smaller tray!
Love this so much I ordered another! I initially bought this in order to find the binki more quickly in the night.  Come to find out, my 4 month old can manipulate the binki a lot easier and is able to put it in on his own.  He occupies himself taking it out, loooking at it, and placing it back in his mouth over and over.  He is now 5 months old and chews on the animal's feet to soothe his inflamed gums!
just picked this item up, along with the flower, to complement our grass drying rack for baby bottle parts.  it is a godsend- the small branches are perfect for bottle nipples and collars, and that frees up tons of space for more bottles or more parts.  if like us you have dr. brown bottles, you'll know how much of a pain they are due to the number of parts you have to clean and dry.  highly recommended.
My 2 month old loves her WubbaNub Giraffe and so do we. The size of the giraffe allows for her to grasp and hold it while sucking on the soothie comfortably.  This also reduces the frequency of the soothie falling out of her mouth. We love her WubbaNub so much, we plan to get another giraffe for her to take to daycare. We get a lot of compliments on how cute she looks holding her giraffe when we are out.
My grandson, who is now 5 months old, cannot be far from his pacifier when he is tired...it calms him and off he goes to zzzzz!  This is a wonderful item....He has two other animals.....I love it because it is easily found....AND it is machine washable!  Now that he is a little older, he can put it in his mouth himself!  One caution!  The puppy I got was NOT brown, it was a gold color...but I didn't care!
My son loved this toy so much, I had to order two more, just to be sure there was one at the house, one in his bag, and one in reserve. I found he chewed on the legs and tail as much as the pacifier. I ended up putting the whole thing in the dishwasher and then letting it air dry to ensure that it was clean and sanitary. It's been more than a year since I purchased my first one, and my son still loves it.
Kiddo loves this thing to pieces! Some<br />Comments: the pacifier is not removable so you can't pop one out and pop in a clean one. I kind of wish it was a clamp or something that held in the paci so I could more easily clean it when I'm on the go. We had to contact customer service at wubbanub because the stitching on the giraffe ear is coming undone, they were very helpful and are sending a replacement
my wife just used this for the first time when flying with our daughter from the us to the uk.  she couldn't be happier.  it did need to be detached from the car seat in order to go through the x-ray machine, but that was simple as it is easy to take apart and re-attach.  it is convenient to not have to take the child out of the seat when changing planes.  it also seemed very comfortable for our daughter.
the package was in perfect condition, did not look squished or anything like it sometimes can get in transit. when i took my dream out of the package it was very soft and perfect!! no snags or pulls. i was nervous to wash it because i didn't want to ruin it!! but i washed it on hand wash on cold and dried on delicate. my daughter took to it right away (she loves her swaddles) i can't wait to buy more!! (;
We love wubbanubs, and this one is cute & unique.  I like to have several because I wash them in batches on the gentle cycle, in a lingere bag with Dreft.  That keeps them from getting too funky.  My one year old is OBSESSED with these &#34;doos,&#34; because they are easy for her to find and manipulate.  Way more affordable on Amazon, than at a specialty baby store.  Thanks AMAZON, you're my huckleberry!
This has saved my life.  Our newborn couldn't keep his binky in his mouth but wanted it so we would have to sit beside him and put it back in every 5min.  With this it weighs just enough to keep it in his mouth but light enough that if he doesn't want it he spits it out or just turns his head and it's out. Now at 3mths he holds onto it and falls asleep...it's so cute.  He can even put it back in his mouth
as a grammy of four i love this item.  it's easy to clean, fits all sized necks. and catches everything that misses their mouths from 7 months to well over two years. between meals i just wipe it off  but after a full days use, i throw it on the top shelf of the dishwasher to sanitize it for the next visit. each grand child has his or her own color, so by seeing the bib, he/she knows food is on the table.
This type of pacifier is the only one our baby would suck on. If you've ever used this pacifier though, you know that it has a tendency to fall out....a lot. The little toy can be set on the child's stomach and provides enough stability that it keeps the pacifier in his mouth. The only drawback is that you can't sterilize the pacifier because of the toy, you can only hand wash the pacifier part with soap.
i bought one as a 'baby shower gift' and ended up buying one for my daughter because they were so cute!!!. the rubber is a bit harder than i expected but if anyone remembers hitting their heads or backs on the metal faucet when they were little and how much that hurt - this will fix that problem.<br />it pours water beautifully out of harry the hippo's mouth. bathtime is now her favourite time of the day!
I am a nurse and this is the paci that is used in many of the hospitals I have worked in and this was the paci of choice at the hospial my twins were born in. The paci did not deter my twins from breastfeeding and it does not leave those awful marks on their faces that some of the other pacifiers do. This is the ONLY paci I will use and have two in every room of my home and 4-6 of them in my diaper bag!!!!
My daughter started using these pacifiers at about 2 months and she took to them, after a start with the soothie pacifier. Obviously it's because they both have the standard nipple shape, which she did not have any nipple confusion concerning her playtex bottle or the boob. She loves these pacifiers even now though she refuses to be moved up to the next stage as the rubber on them is thicker and or harder.
this wrap has been a life saver. i read the step by step instructions the first time i put it on and have not had to read them again, it's pretty easy to put on and take off. i have been using this since my baby was a week old- i was the dishes and use it when he's fussy and needs to be close to his mama. it comes with a little cloth storage bag, but i just roll up the wrap and store it in our hall closet.
i love the primo folding potty!  it is the best!  it is so compact and easy to carry with me when i take my son to the stores or restaurants.  i haven't had any problems finding toilets that it doesn't work on.  my son finds it very secure, especially when he can hold on to the handles.  i love the fact that he has handles to hold onto instead of the dirty toilet bowl.  it is very sturdy and easy to clean.
though this might not be as pillowy as some of the more expensive models i love it its so simple and the cloth is soft and comfortable for my daughter. it is super easy to adjust the straps and to install in the car! would recommend this to any parent on a budget!<br /><br />pros:<br /><br />easy to adjust<br />simple<br />easy to install<br />cheap<br /><br />cons:<br />not very pillowy like better models
i bought this to make sure my 17 month old didn't take off in the book store or the mall.  it's great, although don't tug too hard because the little ones will just keep going and fall back.  still, it's great as an added safety measure and the best part is that my daughter absolutely loves &#34;piggie&#34;.  she kisses him and hugs him every chance she gets and it's never a struggle to get her to wear it.
brush bottle cleaners are far better than sponge.  bought both, and will never buy sponge again.  this is perfect because it stands on its own, dries so it does not stink, and is just long enough for baby bottles.  however, the utility value and target market would be much greater if they added 3&#34; -4&#34; of length to it so it can also clean sports bottles and canteens.  too short for this application.
These pacifiers are excellent. Baby takes right to them without and rejection issues. They're BPA free and made of easy to sterilize silicone that isn't harsh on baby's gums. They are odor free directly from the packaging, so after a good first time sterilization, they can be put straight to use without having any off-putting scents for baby. The generous heart shape makes clearing baby's nose a non-issue.
My daughter only takes &#34;soothies&#34;, and the dinosaur that i recycled from my son who never took pacifiers ended up finally breaking (it took a beating :-( ) so i found this and love it. The elephant is really plush so it gives her a good nice sized 'doll'  to squeeze while shes sleeping, and since she cuddles with it, its nice not having to wake up to slide her passy back in her mouth every few hrs.
i highly recommend this mattress if you buy a porta-crib because the mattress that comes with a porta-crib is thin, flimsy and seems uncomfortable (and too soft if you want to prevent sids). i am using the portacrib as a regular crib because i have to squeeze two kids into one room until we sell our house, so i wanted a decent mattress. babies r us sells portacrib sheets (koala baby brand) that fit it, too.
I have used MAM pacifiers with all three of my babies.  I really like that they fit perfectly around their tiny faces, and that they vent, so baby's skin doesn't get irritated.  The only thing I wish was different was the color options when purchasing.  I chose blue, but got green ones.  Not a big deal though.  Also, these pacifiers do not come with any case to store and keep clean, as some other brands do.
We have tried so many types of pacifiers. Our little one liked many of them, but loves this kind. It may just be a personal preference, but he loves them!  Plus they are super easy to clean and very durable since they are all rubber. And there isn't anywhere for germs to build up since its all one piece. They are a little pricier, but last forever and keep our little one super happy. I'd highly recommend:-)
We love the caterpillar wubbanub.  I first bought it to use mostly in the carseat (it was easy to reach back and grab it to give it to her (vs. digging around for the paci by itself).  Now she's very attached to it and we have a couple.  I love that you can throw it in a mesh bag and wash in the washing machine.  I've washed ours several times and it seems to be holding up well.  Would definitely recommend!
I bought this mattress about a month ago for my baby's playpen; she has her own room, but she sleeps at nights with us.  Mattress is perfect, not hard not soft, just perfect; she loves it.  Most of the time she sleeps on her tummy, and we found that since she started to sleep in this mattress, she sleep maybe 1 or 2 hours more than her usual 7-8 hrs.  Thank you Amazon for carrying such a wonderful product:)
I have purchased these pacifiers so many times.  They are great for once baby is rolling around.  Once my daughter was only enough and rolling in her sleep, it was nice that these would stay in because they are rounded.  My daughter prefers these pacifiers to the nuk which I could never get her to take. The part that goes in baby's mouth is just like what most hospitals give so it was a seamless transition.
it seems like every baby has a sophie.  and why shouldn't they?  it's made in france with natural rubber and food grade paint.  no worries as you watch your precious little one suck, bite and tear at sophie's little hooves, ears and sometimes her entire head.  and it seems kids of all ages love hearing the sound of her squeaker.  my big kids can't stop squeezing her in rapid secession to get another squeak!
baby really likes these. he sucks/chews on the pacifier but also on the hard plastic part when teething. as advertised, the pacifier does close when it hits the floor. once it closes, however, baby can't get it open on his own. if your baby likes to play the game of throwing things down, it will close and you will have to open it again for him. the different faces are cute. we have the clown and the penguin.
With twin baby girls, we found that these are a great option when time for bed and when travelling. We also purchased wubanubs with great success, but these are larger and have an interchangeable pacifier end. This company also sent us the firmer replacements for free a few months ago. Only complaint coulkd be that there is no lock to keep the pacifier in place. We sewed ours on and it worked with no issues.
i used this small chandelier in my daughter's super small closet conversion nursery. it is spectacular especially with the pendent we added above painted in the same black color. she's 4 1/2 months now and it works great. we also set up a dimmer which is really nice to add a bit of light instead of a giant flash. she loves how the shadows fall on the walls. if you need a small chandelier this is a great one!
The green hospital pacifier was the only one that my daughter would take from the start, no matter how many efforts were made to try other types of pacifiers. I particularly like that the plushy filling is heavy enough so that it stays in place while my daughter sleeps. I also like that the soft plushy doubles as a toy when not being used as a pacifier. Plus with this combo it's always great to have a spare.
This cute lil puppy paci has prompted so many adorable pictures. I bought this after having to put paci's back in baby's mouth when they fell out way too many times in a row. I thought this would be a better alternative because the puppy could sit on her chest while the paci is in her mouth. It does exactly that. Granted, it's not heavy so it can be knocked off, but I wouldn't want it to be heavy. ;) Love it!
the podee handsfree feeding system gives your baby confidence and a sense of security as often occurs with leaving them at daycare and nurseries. it provides your baby with the ability to feed itself whenever baby desires. it's as simple as handling a lightweight \\pacifier\\ connected to a tube carrying formula or breast milk. great for fussy babies in the middle of the night. this is the only system i used.
I love these mustachifiers! Gave one to my son for his newborn son and my grandson took to it right away and just looked adorable. Got this second one to give my daughter at her baby shower since she also is having a boy. Great little shower gift if you know the baby will be a boy. I guess you could give it to girl babies, too, but better for the boys. Comes with a cover to help keep it clean when not in use.
i did lots of research before buying this product for my second son, having struggled on with a cheap high chair with my first son.it is easy to strap my son in, it keeps him in an upright position, wheels round the kitchen easily and looks great. i can't fault it. most important of all, it is sooooo easy to clean. i wasted so much precious time cleaning my old high chair i wish i had bought this much sooner.
my child has had wubbanubs since he was in the nicu. he's 4 now, almost 5, i purchased this product a couple of years ago as a replacement. once he turned 3 was easy to break him of using a binky since he got to keep &#34;dog&#34;. dog just doesn't have a pacifier on his face now. even now dog is his favorite stuffed animal. that's why i recommend these, they have a use after outliving their original purpose.
The product came sooner than expected, this is good because the day after I was to give it to my sister. It was exactly as pictured. The colors were vibrant. The packaging was perfect. The nipple was intact (no tears or odd lumps). It didn't have any sharp edges that could harm the baby. I can't wait to see what the baby looks like using this. I will most likely be buying from this seller again in the future.
This is the only brand of gum drop I will ever buy.  All the others (first years) are just different and my baby could tell.  This one is exactly like the one from the hospital and he would not even attempt to use the others.  The vanilla scent wasn't as strong as some of the other scented pacifiers out there and that was definitely a plus.  The scent was just enough to be soothing without being overpowering.
for the price can't beat it !!!! drives smooth even on grass.  there could be more room in the back seat though!!!! this is the only double so far that has fit in our trunk!  if you have two infants or like us a 2 1/2 year old and 8 month old it works.  sure i would have loved to keep the big 12 position metropolitan but we could not get it in the car!!!! we got this one for $108 can't beat that with a stick!
I have a bunch of these and use both sizes them to carry all sort of things (bathing suits, all sunblock prodcuts so the rest of the bag doesn't get all greasy, any item I want to protect from the sand, eg. camera, cel phone, etc., tampons, makeup.)  They are light, very water resistant, machine washable, extremely cute and the price is incredibly attractive to say the very least.<br /><br />I Super recommend
my daughter has worn this since she has been 3 months old. we rarely take it off. it seems to work. she barely has drooled and very few occasions where she has been in pain. i think it helps with teething. i get lots of compliments on it. it's cute stylish and sheek. i think i'm going to get a rose quartz necklace next. she is 15 months old and still wears it. she has never tugged or pulled at it. i love it!!
The hospital gave us this kind of pacifier and I pushed it to the side until I saw another friend's baby using the pacifier with the wubbanub. My newborn reacts a lot different to this style pacifier and it calms her much quicker. I can tell that she loves the feeling of the dog as well. I like that the wubbanub keeps the pacifier from falling when she is done with it. I wish I had used this when she was born.
i originally got a graco bouncer, it was very plain and boring and my 1 1/2 month old would only last 5 minutes in it. we decided to try the ocean wonders aquarium bouncer because she has the fisher price aquarium in her crib and absolutely loves it. needless to say, she also loves this bouncer. she enjoys it so much that she will stay for 1/2 hour - 1 hour! i would highly recommend this product. <br /> <br />
these are so soft (and only get softer with each laundering). my daughter loves these and i felt good about letting her have them in the crib from about 6 months onward because they are so sheer (thus not a suffocation hazard). the only thing i don't love about them is that they are very big. because they are thin, i worried a little about the possibility that my daughter could get one wrapped around her neck.
My little one LOVES these !! These are the best thing ever made. This is the only pacifier he will use. I think we have at least 4 wubbanubs:) I just ordered the lamb one for when he is baptized. These also wash very nice too! They are very easy to find in a diaper bag and when my little one wakes up he just puts it back in his mouth. He has no problem finding it. I don't know it we could live without it:)!!!!
as a young adult i found i've acquired many stuffed animals but had no where to put them short of storage. i ordered one of these and it was here almost immediately. not only that but it holds far more than i was expecting. even left with a little slack it doesn't hang too low. i'm even thinking about buying one for my 2 year old nephew. i'm 100% satisfied with this product and the seller. will buy from again!
People say you shouldn't use pacifiers on a baby. Yeah, right. And you shouldn't put a muffler on your exhaust, it restricts power. Try that one and see what the cops do. If you want to remain sane, buy some of these. Each baby is different, these are the only pacifiers my baby likes. Don't ask me why. Your baby might be different. Try them if you're baby is making your eyeballs look like a plate of spaghetti.
We put these wubbanub pacifiers in his stocking on Christmas morning and he loved it! He got three different ones and he was so thrilled he walked around with one in his mouth carrying the other two at times trying to put all three pacifiers in his mouth. We couldn't get them at toysrus where we originally found them so we were very thankful to find them on Amazon and get them before Christmas. Thanks so much!
Thank goodness that I was able to find these pacifiers on amazon! They are the only ones my son will use and it seems all the stores around have discontinued them. I wasn't too worried about color of pacifiers for when you are in need color doesn't matter...but only 2 days after placing the order I was pleased to have them arrive and extra happy to have gotten blue ones! Would order these again if I needed too!
I love the Wubbanubs!  I have a 10 month old boy who has a couple of these and when I found out I'll be having a girl soon, I made sure I had a wubbanub that would be just hers.  My son doesn't even use pacifiers that often anymore but when he did, he loved holding onto the animal and at night (the only time he really still uses it), it makes it so much easier to find it in the crib if he wakes up and needs it.
My grandson is expecting his first son. Things are not always easy for him and his lady.  The day my package arrived for them with the Mustachifier in it was at the end of several of those difficult days/weeks.  I was delighted when my phone rang, and Chris exclaimed with pure delight, &#34;Nana, you made my day!!  You made OUR day!!&#34;  Their joyful voices made my day, and left a glow for several days after.
it works great. for the price, the materials are fantastic. i have an easy time adjusting the belts and operating the buckles. i know there were a couple reviews that said they were challenging, but honestly , the hooks work better than the other three carseats we have gone for. the buckles are easy and i can even adjust the belts easily with my bad wrists. a+++ on this . also , delivery was prompt. early even.
ordered this to fit in delta mini crib (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/b002mzmdx8/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_26). perfect fit, and firm without being rock-solid. even though this is 3&#34; rather than the 2&#34; recommended by the crib manufacturer, the mattress is firm enough and fits snugly enough that i feel confident that it's safe.<br />comparable in firmness to my daughter's full-size firm crib mattress.
i bought this blanket for my two year old for her cot at school and it is so soft and plush that i want one for myself!  i was afraid it would be thin and small, but it larger than her other blankets and quite thick.  the design is adorable and goes well with many colors.  this is so cute i'm thinking about changing her room decor! and so plush i am looking for more blankets like this one in different patterns.
My daughter loves the soothie binky's and this duck is our third wubbanub paci that we have ordered (we have the lamb and blue bear as well). The only complaint I have with this one, is it doesn't seem to be stuffed very well, and is rather floppy compared with the lamb and bear.<br /><br />Get TONS of compliments on these, and my daughter's day care always knows which Binky is her's without having to label it!
we ordered this swing after the one that we used with our first 3 children broke! we have loved it! the first time we received this package the swing seemed to be defective. however, we contacted amazon and within 48 hours had a new one at our door that has worked perfectly! it was easy to assemble, the material is extremely soft, seems very comfortable for baby, and baby loves looking at herself in the mirror!
this carseat has been great for my son. he rode home from the hospital in this seat and at 18 months just exceded the height limit, so he will be getting a new seat. not only has this seat been safe and comfortable for my son, it has also lasted him 1 1/2 years! it is still in awesome shape and his new baby brother will use this seat when he is born in april. this seat was a great buy and i highly recommend it!
Of all the WubbaNub's we own, this one is the best.  First of all, the giraffe is longer and therefore has more for our daughter to clutch.  Second, even if our daughter doesn't want to chew the pacifier, she can still grab a leg to suck on.  This giraffe has all kinds of appendages she can harass.<br /><br />We own the lamb, frog, and chick too, but the giraffe is her favorite, which also makes it our favorite.
this monitor has great range with perfect visual and audio clarity throughout our house. we love how we can see our 5mo day or night, and when we mute the sound the color wheel lets us know when he is making noise and moving around.  also very useful is the camera which can be adjusted remotely.. if our son moves around the crib we are able to adjust the camera from the screen without disturbing him in his room.
My baby loves his wubbanub. He likes Soothies but doesn't have a very strong suck, so they fall out of his mouth a lot. Before he was grasping things, just the friction from having the stuffed animal on this chest would keep the pacifier from falling out of his reach. Now he can grasp at the stuffed animal and hold it in himself, or kind of maneuver it back in if it falls out. It makes a great lovey and soother!
This natural rubber pacifier is the only one our baby took-- from day one, our little one LOVED this paci.<br /><br />Its healthy, natural rubber which means less worries given how much direct exposure babies have to pacifiers. No nasty chemicals, no scary ingredients.<br /><br />The only negative is the cost-- they are super expensive and they tend to bounce when dropped, which makes them a little hard to find.
I love this pacifier, its cute and really helped our newborn keep the paci in when it kept falling out. However she has since decided that she really does not like pacifiers so we really haven't used it much in the past 2 months. If you have a paci baby though I highly recommend a wubbanub. I will say however that the picture is a little deceiving and its not quite as big as it looks but perfect for little hands.
When I saw this online, I desperately wanted to get it for my NB son.  I waited to be sure he would take to the Soothie pacifier on his current WubbaNub before spending the money on this one (since it's quite a bit more expensive than most WubbaNubs).  He took to it so we ordered this little guy.  It is absolutely adorable!!  Even cuter than the picture.<br />Now to get it cleaned up so we can start using it.  :)
GET THIS SWING!!!  It has all the things that soothe a newborn and their growing stages.  The lit mobile at the top is great for wide awake 2 a.m. occasions.  My son absolutely loves this swing and really enjoys the side to side vs. front to back motion.  It really soothed him and just looks so comfy, cozy for them.  This is the swing for all parents.  They really thought everything out when they made this swing.
Love these!! My son chewed through his glow in the dark pacifiers and so I had to throw them away. I did not realize how great the glow in the dark feature is until we had to use a &#34;daytime&#34; binky at night. I just wish Avent wouldn't make some of their pacifiers with a &#34;right way&#34; to go in. But I'm not counting off a star over it because even when upside down my son doesn't seem to notice or mind.
I LOVE wubbanubs! It is simply just a very cute soothe pacifier! if your little one loves the soothe then get this! It makes the pacifier so easy to find and as your little one gets older it is also a little stuffed animal they can take along. Honestly when the pacifier gets worn out you can just cut it out and sew a new soothe in. I also have thrown this in the dishwasher and washing machine. it holds up great!!
If you need a laugh,you need to purchase this for some little baby. We bought this as a joke for our great-granddaughter and she looks so adorable in it in her mouth. We laughed and laughed. Our baby surely liked this 'binky' because she used it a lot. It was very entertaining to watch the reactions of people when they first saw her with it in her mouth. It is well worth the money just for the laughs. I loved it.
these are great inserts! they easily go several hours between changes (3 hours easily, can do more if i am away from home and don't change while out), are super absorbent, not prone to pressure leaks like microfiber, don't cause booty rash (natural fibers :) ), don't smell like microfiber ones do, light stains don't show, and we love them! we use several of these a day in our pocket diapers. love love love these!
ordered this dispenser to keep my facial wipes in.  it is perfect!!!!  it holds a little or a lot and dispensed only 1 at a time every time.  the secret is the weighted piece that lays on the wipes and holds all of them down except the 1 you are pulling.  it also helps to keep the wipes from drying out.  this works great and i love it--i just wish they made a heated one that dispensed warm wipes (for the winter).
one of the reviews complained about not being able to protect the pictures, but the pictures have been fine in mine and i have a 5.5 month old who puts everything in her mouth. anyway, pictures only cost like 10 cents to print, so i don't really care if one gets damaged every once in a while. it is a great way to help the baby be able to recognize her grandparents since she doesn't seem them as often as we'd like.
love it! i do not have twins but i have an 8 week old baby girl and i love this pillow! i previously owned the boppy and it was okay. with the boppy it always slid away and she would slid through it. but with this wonderful pillow it stays in place with a back pillow for support. the back pillow it velcro for if needed to be take off and just use the straps! this pillow has saved my back! i would highly recommend!
These are my favorite pacifiers because unlike the advent ones they don't seem to fall out of the baby's mouth as easily. Plus now that he is teething he chews on them! I order a new set every 6 weeks (that's the recommended time for replacement by the doctor) so that I can have one in the crib, one in the car seat, one in the play pen, one in the pack n play, a couple in the diaper bag... well you get the idea ;)
Our son used these from day one at the hospital.  When our daughter was born, he still had the green ones from the hospital so in order to avoid him from taking the new baby's, we ordered pink & purple for her.  Much cheaper to purchase in the multipack than from a store (only comes in a 2pk for around $5 and every parent knows that when you need them most they all have disappeared...so good to have a few backups.
My 2nd son was collicky and in desperate need to find something to soothe him I bought almost every type of pacifier I could find.  He didn't end up taking to any pacifiers but my 3rd son ended up preferring these pacifiers over all of the others.  He is breastfed and this pacifier really does seem more natural than any others I have seen.  They are flexible and gentle.  He loves them and won't take anything else.
The caterpillar wubbanub is even more adorable in person than on the website.  My daughter loves to hold it and it allows her to be able to keep her soothie close by.  The only thing I didn't expect was that this wubbanub has a lemony scent.  Neither me nor my daughter are bothered by this, but those of you who are sensitive to smells may be put off by this.  I would highly recommend this product and have already!
My son will be teething soon and thus far he has rejected every brand of pacifier that we have tried. The GumDrop is well made with good quality silicone. It fits my son's face perfectly and leaves room for his little nose to breathe. He prefers licking on it and chewing rather than sucking... but at least he isn't spitting it out! I ordered a vanilla one as well and he seems to prefer that one over the unscented.
This was the best purchase. My husband and I live in a hot humid (mosquito driven) area and this product works great. We are also marathon runners and needed a cover that didn't flap around when we take my sons car seat in the jogging stroller. It also protects when the sun is at different angles. We have a graco snug ride 35 car seat and this fits perfectly. My only wish is that it came in more styles and colors.
i thought it might be too thin, but is is awesome. a bit more generous in cut than the official stokke sheet, easier to put on because it's very slightly stretchy, and much much much softer. i try to wash this and get it back on the bed rather than using my other cotton stokke sheet. i have 2 now and will probably get more. no issues with fading or losing their shape, though i've only had them a few months so far.
WubbaNubs are brilliant for infants. Not only are they adorable, but they keep the pacifier from rolling away when spit out, give me a chance to grab it if it falls, and helps keep the pacifier in or near the mouth. Also, my infant grabs onto it out of instinct when she really can't grab onto anything on purpose yet. Also, I really like saying &#34;pass me the dragon&#34; instead of &#34;pass me the pacifier&#34;.
i love this thing!! my son has had countless hours of fun since getting it from &#34;santa&#34; christmas morning. he is normally very active but refuses to nap for me-since he has been going in this he gets so tired he falls asleep. in two weeks his legs have become stronger, he's more vocal, and i really feel like he feels like he's more independent. super easy to put together-took less than 5 min. great buy!!!!
Absolutely awesome plush soft permanebtly attached pacifier. As you can see in my attached picture, you can wrap their little arms and hands around the bear to hold toghtly in place. Stays in the cuddly caress of her embrace as she falls to sleep quietly suckling her &#34;bobo&#34;. Great invention! Just clean with soap and water. Thought it would be weird thats its permanently attached; but no, it works-perfectly!
i absolutely adore violet! the interaction between child and toy is a huge reason why i am a fan of the leapfrog company. violet can be programmed with the child's name as well as several other favorites. the songs and games that she does are very sweet. i can't wait to see how helpful the lullabies are. thankfully, there are quite a few available to pick from. i may invest in the scout version of this toy as well!
We tried many different pacifiers, shapes and sizes. This pacifier is the best, especially for chubby cheeked babies! It doesn't leave grooves in her cheeks and I love that we don't have to worry about the pacifier being upside down during car rides and sleep time. Glow in the dark ring is helpful too, plus anything glow in the dark is always cooler!  I bought another pack and im ready with the 6-18 month size too!
my little girl loves this elephant!! we got it as a baby shower gift and it became her favorite lovie. it's nice, small, and thin so i never had to worry about her sleeping with it, we actually lost it right after she turned 1 and i had to rush order another one from amazon because she wont sleep without it. it is also made very well we have washed and dried it more times than i can count and never had any problems.
I could not find the MAM Perfect readily available in stores. I purchased online and my daughter loves the MAM perfect. In fact I have several in every color. They are truly very thin and soft. She's used other MAM pacifiers and teethers before, so I had a hunch she would like this pacifier. This has by far been her favorite pacifier. I am recommending this product to all my mommy friends whose babies use pacifiers.
It took our baby girl a long time until she can actually hold the frog (we named him Freddie the Frog). But now at 6 months old she can pick it up and put it in her mouth easily. She also enjoys sucking on the frog's arms and legs.<br /><br />Quality is great and none of them are falling apart. One stays in the car seat, one stays in the crib, and one makes its way around the house or in the diaper bag as a back-up.
i'm a fan! just brought my newborn home last week and he loves to stare at the pretty colors on the ceiling. i also like that i can use the glow from the projector as a mild lamp and see baby's face and such in the night when i check on him without having to turn on any lights. i haven't used the sounds or other features yet. i'll update this if anything goes out on the machine. otherwise, i'm a very happy customer.
If your child takes a pacifier, I can almost guarantee they will love any of these animal pacifiers! But be sure to get at least two of them because, they will not take any other after they use these. And as we all know sometimes one gets missed placed, lost, left at grandma's,etc.. They love to hold the animal on the end. It comforts them and becomes a friend. They are machine washable and are well worth the money.
a life saver! my first daughter has a death suction and was taking chunks off me and i felt like a bad person because i cried over the idea of feeding her. she always wants something un her mouth but i didn't want to give her a pacifier because it might interfere with feeding,  the shields solved both. since i've been using them i have had little to no pain feeding and can give her a pacifier.  happy mom, happy baby
My baby loves these pacifiers. he rejected the pacifiers that were given in the hospital and that are attached to all the wubanubs (you know which one I'm talking about). He just spits them right out, or tongue thrusts them out. But he loves these and they are easy to keep in his mouth.  I love that they come in a little storage box. We keep one box in the pocket of our baby carrier (ergo) and one in the diaper bag.
These are the PERFECT baby shower add on gift. My son is by no means fussy but this little buddy is his favorite car seat companion for the traffic ridden commute to daycare. The nook is attached to the little animal making it easy for the lil ones to grab hold in the early days when the fine, hand to nook skills are a little lacking. And if that wasn't enough reason, they are washing machine safe. Highly recommend!
i love my baby furniture from spot on the square. i got the eicho crib, conversion kit, and matching dresser/changing table. they are both modern and made of non-toxic materials.  i had a problem with the delivery service that brought me my furniture. spot on the square and the store i bought the furniture from acted quickly to solve the problem. i appreciate the companies commit to both quality and customer service.
This Gate was very useful in preventing our child from entering the kitchen and to keep him contained :) in the child proof living room where he can play with his toys and run around.<br /><br />I really like how it is easy to adjust and it fits firmly at the entrance to the kitchen. Later we will move it to the baby's room and I believe it will be easy to adjust the gate to the door width which is really convenient.
I love tommee tippee brand and their pacifiers hold up very well to my expectations! They don't glow very well in the dark but that's not why I bought them. I bought them because we were using the tommee tippee bottles and she would no longer take the hospital pacifiers. Amazon is one of the best prices and love that we get two day free shipping with prime especially since I can't find the size we need in any stores.
we received this as a gift at my baby shower and i was eager to use them. we first brought them out when my daughter was about 5 months old and she loves them! we still use them during bathtime (she is almost 11 months) and also have a few out on her play area since she likes chewing on them. she giggles when i squirt her with them and likes the bright colors. good product for a reasonable price - highly recommended.
we initially bought another rail which had a disc that you affix to the mattress. upon discovering how flimsy the attachment was, we returned it and purchased the dex rail. what a huge difference! the dex rail attaches to the spring frame of the crib, not the mattress. yes, it took a little more work to assemble, but it was well worth it. i feel much more confident placing my child his converted crib now. thanks dex!
MAM pacifiers are the best.  My son only likes MAM.  He spits out other brands like Nuk and Philips Avente Soothies.  These glow in the dark ones are perfect for bed time.  We have been using two for a few months now and they still glow in the dark.  You can recharge them by putting them under a bright light before bed.  No more looking for pacifiers in the dark.<br /><br />All MAM products are much cheaper at Target.
when i discovered that my 14 mo old son could drink from a straw, a started searching for a non-spill straw cup.  we have tried many and this is my son's favorite.  now 16 mo, this is his favorite cup to use.  he feels like a big boy and has no difficulty getting the liquid out.  for those that have expressed concern that it is too difficult to suck, i think it just takes practice for the little one to get used to it.
it does what it's supposed to. i would buy one for a friend of they didn't have one. i'm sure you can use it for other brands than britax, but the fact that they crash test with these is important to me. it holds well and protects the seats. to install you just set it on the seat and plop the base on top of it. easy. other reviewers commented on a smell but ours smelled fine... like a new pair of shoes. no complaints.
Wife: My 5 month old will not take any pacifier, but this pacifier-like teething toy has been a wonderful relief for her teething woes. This item is one solid piece comprised of firm, flexible rubber. It features different textures, and every angle is chewer friendly. In addition, it is easy for tiny fingers to grip. One down side, it does NOT cool off in the refridgerator.     Husband: Most importantly, she likes it!
my son was breastfed and is very fussy about his nipples on pacifiers and bottles. he loves these!after trying just about every brand i found these! i buy them whenever i see them in a store! they sanitize well too! water never gets inside the nipple. they seem to have a natural fit inside the mouth of a youngster. they come in so many great colors and designs too! he has one to match just about anything he wears! lol
i really like these. after previously using the thirsties hemp inserts, we decided to try these babykicks when we needed to up our stash of hemp. we love these. not only do they absorb more, in volume, that the thirsties brand, but they are thinner and dry faster. our little one is only 12 weeks old, and the small is the perfect size insert for her pocket diapers. as she grows, we can always still use it as a doubler.
my daughter was given a different style of this brand for easter of 2011.  she never goes anywhere without her.  i have to steal her away to throw her in the laundry lol.  we  bought her this style for christmas hopinng she would love her a much....now she carries both.  it is a very pretty doll and well made for the cost. perfect doll for a baby girl, soft with no parts that can come off.  difinitely would recommend.
These are the only pacifiers that my son doesn't immediately drop.  The way the pacifier forms a bulb at the tip makes it easier for him to get a good grip on it, so it doesn't fall out until he spits it out.  I should note that we've been using these since my son was a few days old even though they are listed for 6 months and up.  He couldn't really get a grip on the newborn Mam pacifiers, they are shaped differently.
This is the best!!  My son is able to take the pacifier in/out of his mouth on his own, we no longer lose pacifiers, and it is easy to catch if it does fall out or he drops it.  We give this to our 5 month old every night and we find him curled up snuggling with the lamb throughout the night.  Sometimes he will even put it back in on his own in the morning and go back to sleep for a bit.  This was a lifesaver for us!!!
This is truly one of THE best items I got for our new baby.  We live in Michigan where the winters are cold, long and often brutal.  The bundle me makes baby so cozy and we do not have to struggle with snow suits or multiple layers for quick trips out.  The zipper feature is nice too.  You can unzip and remove top of bundle me when weather warms up a bit- that way baby is still cozy without being too hot. <br /> <br />
These are perfect for sandwiches.  I purchased these at a discount to review them, but they are worth full price.  It's making the switch from plastic more fun.  They wash out very well.  I haven't tried machine washing them yet, because it's just very easy to wash them out by hand unlike some other brands that I've tried that don't flip inside out very well.<br /><br />The photo shows this size vs the mini vs a penny.
the suction cups work on smooth surfaces, my wall is bumpy so i used velcro instead. the size is perfect for toddlers (not sure why so many people say it is too small, mine is accurate to the picture) and my 3 year old loves his new potty so much he used it before i could put it on the wall haha made me hold it because he was too excited to wait!! so happy i bought this! wish there was an option like this for girls! ;)
this is a very nice high chair.  babies sit very comfortable in it.  the tray is easy to handle and the chair itself fold up nice and neat.  stands by itself and can be stored very easily.  i was very impressed with how easy it unfolds and folds up.  the wheels make it very portable and the adjustable seat height is nice.  i cannot find anything about it that i don't like and our grandson seems to feel the same way! :)
i never thought i'd rave about a plastic tub, yet i am very happy with this tub. the infant seat is the perfect angle for washing hair without getting soap in their eyes. the height is right, and makes it more comfortable for the parent administering the bath. you only need 3-5 gallons to fill the tub, so it saves water as well. i'm confident we'll still be happy with it even when our daughter outgrows the infant seat.
i am very pleased with the purchase of the fisher price space saver high chair.  it is compact without being too small and it has all the features i was looking for in a high chair:  dishwasher safe tray, reclining seat and a seat cover that can be wiped clean.  it attached to my dining room chair easily and can also easily be removed if the chair is needed for a dinner guest.  i would absolutely recommend this product.
i've been looking for a couple backpack harnesses for my son for a while.  there are a lot of cute ones out there but i wanted something a little different.  when i spotted this i knew i had to try it out.  i was a bit worried because the price seems too good to be true - including shipping!  but i needn't have worried, it's a great item.  we've used it a couple times and it's nice and sturdy and just so stinkin' cute!!
i done research for many days before buying this seat protector. i have leather seats and wanted to be very careful to not ruin them from the car seat base or car seat protector. this one is made very well and had nothing on the bottom that would hurt my seats. i highly recommend it, but it did not work for me. unfortunately it does not fit my 2015 jeep patriot seats correctly. my base is bigger than the seat protector.
My 3 month old loves mam binkis, and is very gassy/ has colic. And I have tried many bottles. After buying these my search is over! Love them. She isn't nearly as gassy and doesn't spit up as much! Plus they form to her mouth leaving less of a formula mess!! Love love love them! And sense most states don't sell them I was glad amazon did when I went on vacation... Highly recommended for fussy, gassy babies with colic :)
This sterilizer is a little pricey, but I'd say it is worth it if you can afford it. I sterilize my baby's bottles daily and I love how easy it is. The best part is that it offers a drying feature. It is easy to operate and clean as well. The sterilization cycle sometimes takes longer than 8 minutes (my maximum has been almost 16 minutes so far), which to me is alright. The bottles come out clean, dry, and ready to use.
we have been very happy with this changing pad so far.  it fit perfect on the top of our baby dresser.  we keep it covered all the time.  i would highly recommend getting the longer one just because our son is almost 6 months old and i can't see this lasting us longer than a couple more months due to his length!  we bought the [[asin:b002ud65x6 carters super soft dot changing pad cover, chocolate]] which fits perfectly.
i bought one of these and tested today for the first time.<br /><br />i became very happy with the smart two way communication of this device. beyond the fact of the product allow the parents to talk to the baby over voice, it turns off the infrared lights of the camera when you are not viewing the baby!<br /><br />normally i don麓t like motorola products, but this is over my spectations!<br /><br />thank you amazon.com!
Oh my geez, if you buy this, as a lady, your uterus will begin demanding you have a baby. That's how cute it is. I speak ridiculous gibberish every time it's in the room. It actually may be a weapon from another planet, because adults turn into blubbering idiots in its presence, because it's too cute. I got this to be the topper on a diaper cake for a giraffe baby shower, and it looks wonderful. Did I mention it's cute?
so far i am a couple weeks into it.  have been using these seat protectors under a car seat and they are definitely working as i would have expected.  spills, crumbs, and all that other junk that magically appears under a car seat is captured and our leather seats are protected. it also is nice to know some of the corners of the car seat are not rubbing directly against the seat.  great price for a little peace of mind.
This is actually a &#34;backup giraffe&#34;.  We got the first one at a baby shower, and our infant loves his wubbanub so much that we wanted to have a second one in case of loss.  Before we got the second one, we recently had a panicked search through the grocery store for the dropped giraffe.  He loves it so so much.  Our friends have commented how the giraffe is in all of our photos of our son.  Well worth the price.
These are the PERFECT baby shower add on gift.  My son is by no means fussy but this little buddy is his favorite car seat companion for the traffic ridden commute to daycare.  The nook is attached to the little animal making it easy for the lil ones to grab hold in the early days when the fine, hand to nook skills are a little lacking.  And if that wasn't enough reason, they are washing machine safe.  Highly recommend!
Great deal. My daughter loves these soothies and I like them better than many of the hard backed pacifiers. The holes on them also allow for lanyards which we love using. She constantly swipes it out of her own mouth or sucks on it so hard sometimes that it spits out by recoil. The 8 inch lanyards are clipped to her clothing so that it doesn't hit the ground and I don't have to keep washing Soothies or get a replacement.
Our Wubbanub is so popular with my daughter that we are actually now starting to limit how often we let her use it (to naptime!).  She was never much of a pacifier user until we introduced the Wubbanub.  This is great for helping her nap, great for long car rides, and if we didn't limit her, she would have it in her mouth all day long.  The stuffed cow part is durable and easy to clean.  Overall, a great pacifier option!
My 3 1/2 month old has been attached to his monkey since he was about 3 weeks old. He doesnt need/use the pacifier for longer than a few minutes, but his face lights up when he sees his monkey. When he started day care I made sure it went with him so that he would having something familiar and comforting with him during the day. It has defintely helped him develop his dexterity and can easily reach for/handle the monkey.
I got these for when my niece is here on the weekends.  My sister-in-law loves them and bought some herself already!<br /><br />PROS:<br />+ Lightweight<br />+ Nipple is shaped like hospital pacifiers<br />+ Shape of the shield fits better under baby's nose<br />+ Seems easy to hold on to without dropping<br /><br />CONS:<br />- None so far<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:  For my (10 week old) niece anyway, the perfect pacifier!
WubbaNub Lamb has become the favorite soothing pal for my little 8 month old daughter.<br />Up until this month she never took any paci<br />WubbaNub lamb has become her pal, she carries it and holds the little legs as she chews the rubber part.<br />Easy to clean.<br />Have washed this thing 5x in a few weeks - washes nice each time.<br />small enough for little hands.<br />soft and cute for little ones who are teething.
Most parents know that not all babies will use just any pacifier.  My 9 month old has consistently preferred Avent pacifiers since he was a newborn.  We switched to the next biggest size at 8 months, and it took a little while for him to get used to it.  He uses both the smaller and the bigger sizes now.  I love the designs and different colors although I don't believe you can specify colors when you order through Amazon.
We purchased this for two reasons. One being that it makes trying to find the pacifier in the dark or in the car way easier, and two so that our daughter would be able to find it and hold on to it. Product is well made, and well packaged. Item is machine washable (we found this out after it took a swim in the porcelain throne) and very durable. Highly recommended for anyone with little ones who are still using a pacifier.
this is the best baby/kid body wash! i love the smell of this wash, it is so clean and crisp. also it does not have the harmful chemicals that some of the other baby washes have. i have used burts bees and i like the way this wash cleans my child, and how it smells a lot better. also the pump is a must when you have a more mobile baby/kid. it is easy to get out with one hand. i recommend this product to anyone with a kid.
this is perfect for on the go diaper changes or when you don't feel like toting an entire diaper bag. it comes with a small plastic wipes case. the mat is the perfect length for an infant or younger toddler. it also features storage areas for a diaper or two. i keep this in my living room so i don't always have to head to our nursery when my little guy needs a change. i'm considering purchasing a second to keep in my car.
My son loves these pacifiers.  I took a chance an ordered two sets from Amazon and received two sets of pick pacifiers with peacocks.  This seems to be what they have been sending out recently based on other reviews, so if you are wanting girl colors you might want to give it a go.  I don't mind that I received pink and knew that it was a gamble, but probably would not have ordered them if they did not offer free returns.
this is by far one of the most important things we've bought since having a baby. unfortunately, once our baby's boogies get in the aspirator, it turns into my dog's favorite chew toy. i'm on to my fourth nosefrida because the dog keeps eating them.<br /><br />since our little man started day care, he's been sick a ton, and his nose is always stuffed. this product is heaven-sent.  they work so well--its worth every penny.
i love the wood accent on this gate.  i do find that it does scratch easily, especially with pets and unwieldy toddlers loaded with toys to slam and bang against the gate.  the auto close feature is really nice and i love that it closes quietly because during random nap times it's easy to forget there is a kid asleep and the slamming of the metal gates we have can often wake a kid up.  so far, we are really happy with it!
...Because they don't have a space that you can't get to or wash. These are the best.<br /><br />Other pacis that have the nipple that is a &#34;closed loop&#34; allow water to get into the nipples but won't allow the water out...So after a while, I can imagine mold growing inside the nipples. When I saw the water after I washed the other nipples, I just threw them away.<br /><br />These pacies, you can wash every aspect.
we bought this for ease of travel rather than bringing our full size car seat for our 4-year old.  it is lightweight and easy to carry and store.  very simple to install when taking a cab or uber.  for airline travel it would fit under most airline seats and it fit easily in the overhead on a jetblue e190 (where roll-aboards need to go in sideways), this fit perfectly in the space after two roll-aboards were loaded above.
The only pacifier my son will take! It's easy to clean/keep clean and I have peace of mind knowing that it's made out of a really durable, natural material. The round nipple makes it so that the pacifier never slips out of his mouth, even when he's passed out. We love these pacifiers and get compliments on their appearance all the time! Perfect &#34;crunchy mom&#34; pacifier and my kiddo looks pretty darn cute with it. :)
There is not a cuter, more durable pacifier chain out there than HABA's pacifier chain! Thank goodness I happened to be at the baby store (buying a much cheaper Elmo clip), when I noticed the mother and baby in line behind me. Her baby was playing with this totally adorable pacifier chain, and thankfully the mom gave me the info. I raced home, got online, and ordered TWO. I have received many compliments on my unique find!
i pump almost on a daily basis to keep a back-up supply in the fridge/freezer.  this pump is easy to use and fits well.  it is easy to get the right motion going and is never too powerful.  i haven't used any other pumps so i don't really know how others work but this one is great.  i don't think i could manage a double-pump, this one allows me to pump while i drink coffee or surf the web which makes the time pass quickly.
the dresser has delivered faster than what they told me. i installed it by myself and very easy. i love the material too, i think the top and sides are made by real wood, they are thick and heavy. i was thinking to buy changing table but i decided to just put the changing table on top of this dresser, because the height is perfect to me, no need changing table anymore... safe money and space in the room for something else!
really wonderful drool bibs! i've had many over the course of three kiddos, and these are by far my favorite. the wetness really doesn't soak through to the other side. it is very very soft to rub against baby's sweet skin. i have washed a dried and they have continued in great quality, keeping perfect shape. and they are adorable. i highly recommend. i would use these designs for both boy or girl. will be giving as gifts.
This pacifiers (or ninnys as we call them) are my son's favorite brand. He is 2 months old and has taken to them from his very first week. We have other brands but Avent seems to be the one he enjoys the most. I also love the shape of the nipple and have had no nipple confusion. I was worried about this from reading various articles but he started on the pacifier from his 4th or 5th day of life and has never been confused.
i'm a first time mom so, for what it's worth, i don't have much to compare this to. but i love this travel system. it's very easy to use and the stroller is such a smooth ride, much more so that i thought it would be. it's so smooth and easy to push, i was able to push my baby with one hand while walking my two big dogs with the other. i like having the piece of mind knowing that my son is safe riding in a quality product.
this was a last minute impulse buy before our baby was born, we wanted something to put the baby in that would allow him to stay in the same room as us if needed. we never imagined how much we'd depend on it, taking it with us whenever we travel somewhere with the baby and he sleeps better in it than his crib right now so he gets to rest in it when he's having a rough night. we've used it for two months now with no issues.
this bather has been in use for over a year now at my house. it keeps my baby safely out of the water when i need her to be, and fits nicely in my bathtub. i can hang it on my shower curtain to dry and for storage. to me it feels like the baby is more secure in this bather than a conventional baby tub that you fill with water. it is also convenient that you don't have to fill and drain this bather.  i would recommend this!
We purchased quite a few pacifiers and this is the only one our newborn son loves.  We got a dozen and they are great to soothe him.  We love that it doesn't wrap around his mouth and it easily falls out of his mouth when he falls asleep.  As much as we wanted our son to have great sleep habits without using a pacifier, sometimes after many sleepless night and days,  you do whatever gets the job done and keeps your sanity.
this is a compact food jar. however, do note that it does not have the best heat retention capability around. usually pack my boy's lunch in the morning around 9am, and by 2pm, food inside will not be very hot.<br /><br />for better heat retention, i will recommend this..<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/b0017ifsis/ref=as_li_tl?ie=utf8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeasin=b0017ifsis&linkcode=as2&tag=justckem-20
We purchased this for our daughter and it was one of the best gifts we could give to her.  When she puts the baby down she can watch to make sure she is OK.  You not only can watch but also hear their every move so you are aware right away if they are awake, etc.  The monitor is clear to see and the sound is very good.  Definitely would recommend this for anyone with an infant or if you are a caregiver to an elderly person.
i put this fence up and take it down easily.  when toddlers are in the house or when the pets need to be contained.  it's easy to use, it's effective, and it doesn't damage the wall.  the cat can pass through it, which for me, is a bonus. it opens easily with an option to click the latch into a locked position if needed. just slide the &#34;lock&#34; back, and lift the latch to open the gate, this can be done with one hand.
The 1st pacifier my daughter was given was the hospital pacifier- which made it very difficult to get her take anything else because of the different shapes.... My only problem with the hosp. pacifier is the shape- its round so when she got a cold it blocked her nose and the shape of these pacifiers are great! They let her breath and she absolutely loves them! I highly reccommend them to everyone I know that has a new baby!
Planning on bringing my new grandson South for a visit some time, so I wanted him to fit in from the word go. Dressed in a pair of bib overalls, and Billy Bob buck teeth will get the silver spoon spoiled in the womb little rascal over the Mason Dixon minus pretense. A Walmart gift card will accesorize him with the necessary fishin pole, and BB gun, for a good ole frog catchin expedition at Grandpa's place on Lil Dogwood ;^)
great transition diaper between newborn and one size snap downs. in my opinion the one size diapers tend to bunch up a lot, especially between the legs leaving your baby all wierdly shaped and bulky. this one is much narrower in the crotch area. you can perhaps get away by putting this on a chunky newborn 8lb+. but certainly won't fit you right out of the hospital. the quality is good.<br /><br />buy it elsewhere for $6/$7.
i have a 2 month old who thinks this thing is an absolute party-out-of-bounds. she stares, completely transfixed...then she cracks up. then she stares some more, smiling all the while. then she cracks up. repeat until the 15 minute timer runs out. the music is quite good, though the sound quality is not stellar. the design of the animals themselves and the movements they make are what make this toy so good. would recommend.
love these bottles! my daughter is 2 months old and will drink from them without any problems. she is just starting to outgrow the stage 1 nipples so will be purchasing the stage 2 ones soon. i have the stage 2 classic but i like the naturals better because i think it's easier to switch from breastfeeding to bottle because of how the nipple is shaped. they promote breastfeeding and have anti colic anti gas function as well.
The hospital I have my children at uses these.  It seems that once they are hooked, this is it!  The only problem is they are not readily available to purchase like the bigger brand names.  They also have no place to put the clip that prevents the child from losing it.  My son loves these, however, I can't seem to have enough of them because he drops them, they bounce (oh, yes, they are rubber you know) and they get lost!!!!
Bottom line...Every baby is different. This is the only pacifier my son will take.  I purchased it originally because it matched my theme and it turned out to be a good investment.  My son will not touch any other pacifier. He is now 4 months old and loves playing with the giraffe while sucking on the pacifier. He loves holding and petting the giraffe.  Putting the giraffe in his mouth is far more exciting than the pacifier.
These are seriously the best invention for holding a soothie! We used these with our last child and are now using these with our newest addition. We rarely loose the binky. They are nice and soft, easy to clean. We throw ours in the wash with all the other baby clothes and rinse the soothie part after to remove any film the detergentay have left. For those parents who choose to give their child a pacifier this is a must have
This is probably the 3rd or 4th review I've ever given on Amazon, but I felt it deserved one. I got this for my son when he was born in 2012. It has held up well through washes and binkys are easily changed. My son LOVES this thing. He is now two and carries it around everyday and sleeps with it at night. If we ever lost &#34;bb bear&#34; as we call him, it would be the end of the world for him. Let's hope that never happens.
This is the only pacifier my daughter will take so I have to give it a good review! We tried Nuk and she constantly spit them out. The Soothies look big but are perfect from newborn to 3 months. Everyone gets a kick out of looking inside the hole to see her sucking on it. The only issues I have with these pacifiers are that pacifier clips don't go on them easily and the thing bounces like a rubber ball when it hits the floor!
we had another seat that just sat in the bathtub for our newborn which she hated, so i decided to buy her a little tub of her own. she loves this!  the water stays around her tushy to keep her warm (which the other seat didn't do so i think that's why she hated it) and she enjoys kicking her feet in it to splash water everywhere. :)  i also love that it will adjust by taking out the spacer as she gets older. highly recommend!
Starting at around 6 months, my son really started to love this.  When they're little, it's easy to lay it on their chest so it doesn't fall out of their mouth quite as easy.  When they're older, they look for their giraffe.  The only thing I don't like is keeping the stuffed animal part clean because it gets wet easily with slobber.  But throw it in the wash and it's back to new.  Definitely don't put it in the dryer though.
Was looking for a holder for my sons spottier when I stumbled upon these gems. The price is worth it. Baby doesn't lose his paci in his crib as often. And he loves snuggling with his giraffe. I bought 2 so we always have back up in case one gets lost. People are always commenting on how cute and unique these pacis are.<br />Friends of mine just had a baby. Since the hospital uses the soothies I'm buying some for the new baby!
i can't believe i thought i didn't need this...  it works great and was really easy to figure out.  it's highly adjustable to fit many different sizes, so it'll still fit as the baby weight goes away. i didn't try any other pumping bras so i don't have anything to compare it to, but i don't feel like i need to.  this product should be included with every double breast pump and has earned its spot as my go-to baby shower gift!
When we were in the hospital, the nurse gave us a Nuk pacifier to calm our baby.  He never got the hang of latching onto it so it kept falling out of his mouth or he'd just push it out with his tongue.  We purchased the Sootheis just to try them and he loves them.  It hasn't interfered with breastfeeding at all (my one concern about pacifiers in general).  It's also really fun to look inside the little hole when he's sucking!
These things are so great.  They help keep the pacifier in my babies mouth when sleeping and in the car seat.  Plus they are a soft toy for them to hold on to.  I wish that I had known of them with my first kid.  I used to sleep with my hand in the bassent to keep her pacifier in.  With the second kid I just propped the animal next to her and wala!  Stayed in 80% of the time.  I buy them for all of friends that are expecting.
First try I bought her pacifiers, I bought these at the grocery store and ever since she will spit out or throw any other pacifiers, but these. More than half the time she'll go right to sleep when I give her her pacifier or she'll calm down. I don't give a crap about color because its not like my daughter cares right now anyways, as long as these do their job and help my daughter stay calm or go to sleep is ALL I care about.
These are just like the ones from the hospital. My daughter like these round type pacifier over the oval type. That was until three months later she rejected these and like the other style. One thing I didn't understand was the orange scent thing. I couldn't detect the scent at all. Maybe thats because it's not sitting in my mouth right up against my nose.<br />Also careful with the sizes. Don't but ones to large or to small.
Probably the most expensive pacifier I've bought but worth it. It definitely helps the pacifier from flying out of my baby's mouth. He can also hold on to it too while it's in his mouth. I get a lot of compliments That is so cute. Where did you get that?. I wonder if having the cute animal attached to the pacifier will make it harder for my baby to give up the pacifier later? I guess we'll cross that bridge when we come to it.
added another german shepherd to the family.  she didn't respect the shorter baby gate like her older brother so figured we would get something bit taller and more permanent.  installed it using the cups that go into the door frame for added insurance.  love the fact that we don't have to take it down to go in and out.  my door opening didn't require the use of the two extensions, but saved them just in case we need to move it
These are the best pacifiers for the best price.  She started using these shortly after she was born.  They have a hole at the bottom that we can use to put a pacifier hook/string on. She likes to put her fingers in the holes.  These are the best.  There is no need to spend more money on the expensive pacifiers.  Our little 13 month old just started to bite through her pacifiers (she has 15 teeth) so we are replacing them now.
It is great to have this used instead of fingers or thumbs since it can be taken away later. This pacifier really seems to help with the teething. We actually put one in the freezer and then give it to the baby when he is teething. It works. We have tried a different pacifier and he did not even want it.<br />Now that he is old enough to hold his pacifier, he also takes it out and sometimes teethes on the side of the pacifier.
great product.  these organic reusable wash cloths are so soft and gentle.  they are brilliant to use on the sensitive skin of your little ones.  no need to spend out on disposable wipes now so this product is so economical and better for the environment.  they wash up well and maintain their softness.  i highly recommend these great cloths, not only for babies' use but also for adults too especially those with sensitive skin.
I really like this nursing cover. Haven't used it for nursing yet but I can't wait.  I ordered the Suri pattern and it is a really pretty pale orange and almost a teal blue color.  I wish they had a sling in the same pattern as I would love to buy it.  It's very adjustable and I think I'm going to have plenty of room to nurse underneath it without exposing too much in public. It is very soft cotton fabric and seems breathable.
We literally tried 7 different kinds of bottles and finally we found this one!! This is the one my daughter actually drank from!! She hated Dr. Browns. Please try this bottle if your child is not feeding well! I LOVE MAM bottles. Oh and make sure it has the vent system like these have. So much easier to clean than Dr. Browns too!! I can say enough how amazing these are!!!! My child finally ate again without choking or gagging.
We love these and have a couple of them!  If baby drops the pacifier it doesn't go bouncing across the room!  Also, these are harder to drop as they just kind of stay in place better than a lone paci.  My two month old can almost wrap his arm around the reindeer and keep the paci in place, or if it pops out he can work it back in because it stays near.  I wasn't really sold on these until I used them, now they are a must have!
It's a nice little rubber soother... easy to clean. don't have to worry about petroleum chemicals, which is nice. not sure what else to say. My only complaint is that the age recommendation is difficult to find on the packaging, if not impossible to find. I believe I ordered one that was for 3-9 months, but when i received it, I couldn't find this information on the packaging, and felt that the pacifier was on the larger side.
we got this for our 5 month old son, james, and he just loves it. the music is very fun and he loves bouncing to it. the toys catch his attention (especially the dangling parrot and banana). this has a really cute padded monkey seat too (that's washable!). the chair swivels so that he can look all around him. we're getting a lot of use out of this! we definitely recommend this for any baby who is starting to sit up on his own.
i waited a month before writing this, to be sure of my feelings. we bought this gate for my new german shepherd puppy. after a month, i have to say, for the price, i love this gate! as long as you measure your door openening, this gate will keep your dog, or baby where you want them. sturdy, and light, they have stood up to this puppy as he has grown. and german shepherd's grow quickly! no worries, this is well with the money!
The dragon is well made and nicely weighted so it helps hold the pacifier in place.  The legs, wings and tail are chunky and solid enough that my infant can grab hold of them and pull the pacifier up to his mouth.  Like all the WubbaNubs we own, the dragon has been really useful (hard to lose, easy to find in the dark, easy for tiny fingers to hang on to) and I can't imagine going back to using the Soothies without a WubbaNub.
When your baby cries in the night and you're trying to quiet her so she doesn't wake your other baby, what do you do when you can't find a g-d binky?? Do yourself a favor and get at least 2 glow binkies. Save yourself the frustration of looking for a normal pacifier in the dark or with a nightlight. These don't glow crazy bright, just bright enough that you can see them if your eyes are already adjusted to the dark. Love them!
i am very happy with these 4 layer bamboo inserts.  they are very trim, soft, and absorb well.  i pair them with a hemp insert in a pocket diaper and as long as i change within a reasonable time have had very few leaks.  the inserts wash well and even after 4 months of frequent use they are in good shape and there is no build up of odor.  i have had some slight staining but nothing a little time in the sun hasn't taken care of.
My little one has not been a huge fan of pacifiers but he absolutely loved his little giraffe. #1 You can't loose it so easily #2 It's very light weight (I've heard some people actually mention they wouldn't buy it because they didn't think they were safe ... NOT TRUE) #3 If your little one is like mine and doesn't actually care for the paci so much, they have plenty of legs to chew on and make their little gums feel better. :)
We love our wubba nubs! They are perfect for newborns because they help to keep the pacifier in place and our now 7 month old loves it and can put it in on her own. They are so cute and easier to find in the dark or the diaper bag than a small pacifier. Our Ella Bella got torn from the soothie at day care and Mary Meyer replaced it for us for free. One of our favorite baby products, this is a great gift--adorable and so useful.
my son is 2 months old and i only use this pump about twice a week to store milk for when i'm away from him, or for the convenience to feed him from a bottle while im out & about. so far it's worked great for me. when my breasts are full i am able to pump about 4 ounces from each breast in 10 min or less...for now this is all i need but i will definitely look into buying an electric one if i ever need to pump more to save time.
A must have for any baby that likes pacifiers.  This was great for my daughter as she used to throw her pacifier and then scream because she could not get it back.  Now she just reaches up and grabs it again.  I have bought these for 3 of my friends and their kids all love them.  My daughter is now in a convertible car seat and still uses it.  We put it on her lap and she plays with animal and still has acccess to the pacifier.
My daughter took a pacifier early on -- as in the first week. But then she lost interest. Someone recommended the Soothie to me for breastfed babies, and once she got a hold of it, she never let go. At 13-months, this is still her favorite one. She'll tolerate others, but the Soothie works for her. We do use a pacifier clip with it for the carrier and stroller. Works just fine. I wash these in the dishwasher in the bottle rack.
this drying station is working well for us! we use dr. brown's glass bottles and the prongs hold the bottles up well. as other reviewers have noted, this doesn't come with a tray so you need to put down a towel or something - which isn't a problem for me, and it means that the whole thing can have a nice slim profile.<br /><br />this has enough prongs for a few bottles, dr. brown's air-reduction stuff, and pumping paraphernalia.
threw my 6 month old boy on this thing, he fell in love with it instantly. i also bought some gym mats to go under it so when he falls and smashes his head into it, the tile doesn't break his skull. if you have gym mats or carpet, this thing is wonderful. if you have tile or a hard floor, it's definitely not thick enough to prevent brain damage (haha). but seriously, its entertaining for the baby, just put some support under it.
Pros:<br />*Cute, I get comments from people all the time on how neat/cute it is<br />*Easier to find in moment of screaming baby panic than a traditional pacifier<br />*Stuffed animal makes it easier for baby to hold<br />*Ability to tuck stuffed animal into straps of car seat to keep in place for baby<br /><br />Cons:<br />*Pacifier doesn't attach, so you must wash the whole thing or wash just the pacifier part very carefully.
I'm a great-grandma that likes to think ahead. Besides, I am handicapped and live six hours away from her, and don't travel very far. She is only five weeks old, but was almost 9 lbs., 21&#34; long, when born. These pacifiers are for 6 to 12 month old, but I figure she was half grown when born, so may be using them at 3 months. Since they love anything Dr. Brown's, and I have bought them a lot of it, I know they will love these.
There are some pacifiers that say 0-3 months for a reason. These were bought for my newborn but my older kid takes them and chews on them too. They hold up well and the shape is preferred by almost all of the babies I know. (Which is a little disappointing because they're not cute.) They are a little weird when in use since you can see into the back. It's hard to resist sticking a pinkie in to the chomping pink/purple baby jaws.
My baby loves these. She chews on the sides when teething. Also, she didn't have any issue going to the new size. I just wish i could know when ordering exactly what the colors would be, Instead of yellow, mine came with green edges. I don't mind though. I also liked the fact that these are different than ones sold in the stores. There were several babies born in our church this year and alot of them had the same newborn paci's.
My 2 month old son loves his wubbanubs, not to mention how convenient they are for me as well. I was constantly picking up and having to wash his other pacifiers because whenever they fell out they were gone. However with the wubbanub it stays on his chest and he is able to grab it again with his mouth whenever it falls out. He also loves to hold the animal which is a great thing at this age of development! Love this product!!!!
i bought this because i'm always dropping stuff in the middle of the seats and it's a pain, i usually have to get out of the car and on my knees to get whatever i dropped, i still find stuff months later when i vacuum my car out. but these work great!  you are always a safer driver with this product. i can't say \\thank you\\ enough for making this. highly recommended. you'll wonder how you got along without one all these years.
these diapers are super cute. they started fitting my baby when he was about 9 lbs, and the patterns are just stinking adorable. they're very soft to the touch. i love that they have all snaps and no velcro. they're a good start to a cloth diaper collection.<br /><br />these sometimes leak around the leg seams, but it may be an issue of my son's shape. i'm not certain yet - we'll see as he gets bigger. for now, i recommend them.
This satineesnug bear was a gift my son received at the hospital when he was born.  Now, at 1.5 years old, he sleeps with every night.  The first thing he does when I put him down in his crib is snuggle it up to his chest.  It's gone through numerous washings & has held up perfectly.  I'm buying another one so I can switch them out when one is being washed.  I'd recommend this to anyone looking for a sweet gift for the new baby.
I started my baby out with a Nuk and she has never really cared for it. She spits it out like it it's a strange, yukky foreign object! Her older brother, on the other hand, used to like the Nuk just fine which is why I started her out with it. After reading a review elsewhere from a delivery nurse that never saw a baby that didn't like the Soothie, I decided to give it a try. My baby loves it and I'm really glad I gave it a try.
My seven month old loves this toy.  I thought it looked silly, but bought it anyways.  Well worth the purchase.  We attach it to his car seat handle so it dangles in his face.  He loves grabbing the pacifier and putting it in his mouth.  Even when he has other toys and pacifiers in the car seat with him, this is his &#34;go to&#34; toy/pacifier.  You put in your favorite pacifiers, and can change them out when he goes up a size.
These pacifiers are great. I used them with my son seven years ago and I'm using them with my daughter now. Here is why I think they're so great:<br />-they leave no marks on my baby's face<br />-they are easy to clean<br />-I strictly breastfeed, and there has been no nipple confusion problems at all with these<br />-they are reasonably priced so it's easy to have them all over the house<br />-the pink and purple colors are fun!
I was hesitant to buy this for a LOONG time, and finally bit the bullet when my son was already 9 months old, and we were sick of looking for dropped soothie pacifiers and buying replacement pacifiers.  I wish I bought this from the beginning!  When he sleeps at night, he easily feels for it with his eyes closed, and unconsciously slips it back in his mouth...makes for longer naps!!!  ALWAYS a good thing!  GREAT BABY SHOWER GIFT!
Best ever! We bought this when our baby was 2 months old. She was already using the soothie pacifiers so it was easy to switch. Now she LOVES this thing. Its her lovey/paci all in one. It goes everywhere with her at 9 months old. She doesn't always use the paci, but she loves to play with the giraffe, or chew on it when she's teething. Best part about it is the entire thing goes in the washer on gentle cycle (do not machine dry).
My LO has been using these from since she was 1 month old, and she still loves them now that she's 9 months old. The entire pacifier is very flexible and rubbery unlike the traditional plastic backed ones, which means that she also loves to gnaw on it when she's teething. It's also a cinch to clean, rinse it out and microwave it along with all the bottles and things, we literally have 10 of them for her to use throughout the day.
These pacifiers are the only ones I'll let my daughter use. I love that they are completely natural so she is not sucking on dangerous chemicals, and I also love that they are all one piece so there are no crevices for germs to hide in, I also love the look of them. My daughter is EBF so she doesn't take a pacifier much, but these are great teethers also! We have purchased several teethers but she prefers these over most of them!
My daughter does not routinely suck on pacifiers, but at 10 months old, these infant pacifiers (other brands can use harder plastic- the soft material seems to work best) are her favorite teether. She sticks a thumb in the hole and uses the mouthpiece as a sort of cushion so that it doesn't hurt if she chews/bites her thumb. I attach the ribbon clip to the edge of the pacifier so that she can grip it- she also sucks on the ribbon.
My baby suffers from acid reflux and sleeps so much more comfortably on his belly.  I did not like leaving him sleep on his belly and if he did, I didn't get any sleep because I was constantly checking on him.  This monitor works better than I expected, well worth the price.  My baby and I both sleep much better at night.  Make sure you follow the installation directions and it works great.  You won't go wrong buying this product!
I bought these pacifiers at Target a week ago and these are the only pacifiers that my 3 month baby has taken for longer than 5 seconds.  He is breastfed and breastmilk bottled fed too.  We tried the smoothies that we got at the hospital, those only worked for a short time, he no longer wants them.  We also tried the NUK ones but he just didn't want them.  I gave him the tommee tippee and he took it.  I recommend these for anyone.
Initially my son did not take to pacifiers at all, but I did not want him to be a thumb sucker.  So I bought this at 4 months old and almost tossed it.  Decided to keep it and BOY am I glad I did!! He goes everywhere with monkey.  At night, if he wakes, he'll cry a bit and tos around and he can find him so much easier than a plain pacifier and plop him right back in his mouth for a good nights rest.  He loves monkey and so do we!!
love this stroller!!! the best part about it is that it is a side-by-side that fits through doorways! it is very lightweight (for a double) and is super easy to fold and stow. when 2 kiddos are in, the weight is well distributed underneath you and it wheels around very nicely. i know there are many other strollers out there that cost way more and may have more advantages, but this is really all you need and it is a great price!!!!
i purposely sought these out and found them on amazon after owning a set prior. i don't know why i didn't review the item earlier. anyway, the tops and silicone valves are interchangeable with other playtex sets.  i liked the smaller size because who needs an 8 oz cup of milk or juice when your kid hits toddler hood??? i didn't want her to have to bend her head back super far just to drink what's on the bottom. love these so much!
i have had three of these bibs and they are great. they last a long time and are easy to clean. these are better than other plastic bibs because of the snaps. you can unsnap it to clean it thoroughly. you can even put them in the wash. they have a lifetime guarantee which i didn't take advantage of yet, but will for the next bib that gets worn. one bib last me about 1 year of dailly use before it was so worn i had to throw it out.
I love this pacifier...and so does my infant!  I received the catepillar one as a gift and absolutely needed another one in my life because it's so great.  Babies are not adept at holding a pacifier by themselves, so this makes it so much easier as the textured fabric, when set against babies clothes/blanket/side of crib allows it stay put. Keeps baby happy and mom too as I don't have to constantly be putting it back in her mouth.
Love, love, love this pacifier!!  This is our second Wubbanub and our son loves both!  It is easy to keep up with and not hard to clean at all.  I can throw it in the wash and once it is done it is already almost dry.  I use our bottle warmer to sanitize the pacifier in between weekly washes.  This has also been a wonderful comfort item for him at night as we are transitioning him from his bassinet/our bed to his crib in his room.
My baby loves these. I was given some as a gift ended up getting several more. It is helpful to have a few on hand. I tried a few other brands put these are baby boy's favorite. I breastfeed and found these to be good shape and caused no confusion. They are easy to clean with no extra parts that could fall off. They can be used with pacifier clips since they have a hole on the side of them. The ones for younger infants are softer.
most baby mattresses contain a whole host of noxious chemicals, including pbde, pvc, etc. this mattress contains none of those nasty chemicals and use healthy alternatives. i bought this for my son as well as for my nephew-on-the-way. it's certainly more expensive, but i felt it was worth it for the peace of mind and the health of my child. plus, i can use it for the next one and share it with my sisters when their baby time comes.
I received my first wubbanub at a baby shower, and I am so glad that I did!  It has been a life saver because like the other reviews say, it stays in place very well on my son's chest.  The only negative comment I can make is that the area where the paci is sewn to the doggie mouth has begun to rip and is almost completely separated.  It is beyond repair, but it is worth the $15 to replace.  You will be satisfied with this product.
bought this to go with out monkey themed nursery. it does as stated.<br /><br />i like that you can change the color. it stays cool to the touch.<br /><br />i plan to hook this up to a timer in the future once our son becomes a toddler as an alarm clock. placing it on a timer outlet to turn off at a certain time to teach him not to come out of the room until the light turns off. heard its better then teaching them how to tell time.
I am such a fan of the Wubbanub pacifiers! The stuffed animal is easy for babies to hold on to (even infants!) plus it's a lot harder to lose a pacifier when it's attached to a stuffed animal.  I get compliments on our Wubbanubs all the time.  If the stuffed animal part gets really dirty, I will toss it in the washer with a load of baby clothes.  I let it air dry, then I wash the pacifier part with dish soap and water.  Very easy!!
I have had this for two months.  It is sooo soft and has been washed at least 10 times.  I was it in cold on gentle and dry it on low.  The blanket basically looks like I just received it.  It is great to swaddle and wonderful as a cover-up for the carseat in the cold.   <br />Seeing the other reviews I was reluctant to register for this blanket.  I did anyway, and I would purchase another if anything ever happened to our Wamsutta.
I love this thing. It's easy to find. Adds a cuddly-ness to the binky for additional soothing. My daughter loves it. She has had it soon after birth, about a month old since I didn't want a pacifier to interfere with breast-feeding. She will be six months old next week.<br />The one star reviews mention washing problems and needing to stitch it. I have washed mine on regular cycle with no problem many times. Still really white too.
These have really stepped up bed time with our little ones! Making it easier to find these things in the dark is also a big bonus! The glow last at least an hour or two and even longer depending on how dark the room is.  Every parent knows how hard it is to get kids to go to their room and go to bed.  Now, all we use are these glow in the dark pacis and our 1.5 year old son who only gets them at night is super excited to go to bed.
my wife loves the relief these nursing cups provide. she wished she would have had these for her first two pregnancies. they are hard plastic, but not completely hard. they are soft enough to be comfortable, yet still sturdy enough to keep their shape while worn. however, regardless of what the box says, it is probably not a good idea to wear these in public. they are more suitable for home use, unless you plan on wearing a jacket.
We bought the giraffe Wubbanub for our newest addition, our 3rd baby girl. I cannot say enough great things about the Wubbanub. She loves it! It has become such a comfort for her and I can tell her and her giraffe will be great friends. She loves trying to grab and snuggle it and I love that I don't have to keep putting a pacifier back in her mouth all the time. Thank you Wubbanub for making a product that is great for every mom :)
i wanted a star-child type doll for my 8 month old daughter, and this works perfectly as a bedtime lovey.  it's the perfect size for her hands and she has loved it from the moment i gave it to her.  the doll itself is very very soft.  i love that it's organic and sustainably made, too.  it's so affordable that i plan on buying several and keeping around as baby-gifts; i know many mamas that will like this for their little ones, too.
These are the best pacifiers. With my second daughter, we tried the green ones you get from the hospital but she couldn't keep them in her mouth. So we went to the orthodontic style of Nuk but those things are gross because after a month or so, they smell funky no matter how much you wash and sanitize them. I love the one piece style of this and that it's silicone like the hospital style and that it has the orthodontic tip. Perfect!
We have purchased many of these for our daughter and our friend's children.  They are a hit!! They love the binky and the stuffed animal gives them a super soft cuddle buddy at night and nap time.  The nipple is very soft and will rip once your child starts biting and holding it in with their mouth, causing a possible choking hazard.  We have since changed to a similar style designed for toddlers.  WubbaNub hit a home run with this!
a very light and roomy bag with multiple loops and pockets. weight is important considering how much stuff you have to pack with you when you go out.    unlike most diaper bags it fits in the bottom part of our stroller, so we don't have to lug it around with us.    to give you an idea of just how roomy it is, we can fit 10 diapers, wipes, a changing pad, 2-3 wash cloths, a change of clothes, a toy or two and a pretty thick blanket.
i got these because i was worried that letting my older infant use the 0-3 month size would be some sort of safety hazard. the only real difference is that the plastic on this size is thicker (and thus maybe sturdier). he seems to like them as much as he liked the softer 0-3 month size. but there is enough difference between the sizes that a baby who is more particular about the softness of his soothie might prefer one or the other.
We have 5 other Wubbanub animals, but this is by far my 6-month old's favorite. He LOVES his longhorn. I love that it is both a pacifier and a lovey, at the same time. My son is soothed just by holding the longhorn's little horns or his paws. It's adorable.<br />I just wash it every day or two by throwing it in the washer and letting it air dry. I quickly bought a second one so that there's always a spare when one is getting washed!
Our daughter came out sucking when she was born, so much so that the dr told me if we didn't give her a pacifier she would suck until I was literally raw. As a mom who wanted to continue to breast feed with the least amount of pain, I took the drs advice but she had a hard time getting the paci back in her mouth by herself. We bought her this & now she can easily grab her kitty & use that to guide her paci to her mouth, works great!
perfect for my shabby chic inspired bathroom. would be cute in a nursery. i would recommend that the seller put some sort of hard flat layer in between the liner and wicker so that the buyer can stand items inside the basket easily. i'm using mine for bathroom organizers but my products won't stand up because of the uneven surface. i will be cutting up pieces of cardboard to lay down in between. other than this i love these baskets.
this item is made of really thick and sturdy material. i used it on the edge of a wooden bed. the tape provided with the product is sturdy and keeps the protector snug and tight. it is difficult for the kids to pull it out.<br />i think the item works well for what it is advertised for. i like the build quality and is not cheaply made. a must have if you especially have 2 kids as they are always running around and pushing each other.
Wubbanubs have been wonderful for my little one.  He loves them and his Soothies, so I had no problem with the Soothie being attached.  And even though he's still a little young to fully grasp them, they're big enough for him to hug easily and hold on to them that way.  It's been great not to have to worry about pacis falling on the floor.  This one is probably the skinniest of the ones that he has, so it's easy to stuff into places.
accomplished exactly what it was needed for.  bought this to keep house-training-resistant puppy in the office with me, so she couldn't defile floors in other parts of the house while i'm working. gently snaps shut so pup can't push it open, but it's  easy for the human to open and close. hinged gate keeps her in sight without making me climb over it to get in and out of the room. fits the door frame fine, and pretty easy to install.
My daughter loves these pacifier/toys.  We have one for her crib, one for our bedroom, one for downstairs, one for the car, and one for the diaper bag.  She can hold the toy and replace the pacifier part in her mouth, and these are large enough for us to easily keep track of.  To wash them, I simply throw them in the washer, and let them air dry, then I wipe the pacifier part with one of the pacifier wipes.  I highly recommend these!
I bought two of these: one for my daughter and one for a friend.  LOVE the Wubbanub!  My little girl was tiny, so other pacifiers could get lost so easily and fall down into her car seat or furniture.  Not the Wubbanub! I could lay it on her chest while the pacifier part was in her mouth, and she LOVED petting the fur! Also, on the rare occasion that she did drop it, it was MUCH easier to find than a pacifier alone!  HIGHLY recommend!
wow! this necklace is beautiful! it seems to be much better quality than the one i got from an expensive local boutique type store.  i ordered the raw honey colored necklace. the packaging is so cute and i love the informative insert too! i love the size of it and right after i put this on baby she smiled, drank a bottle, and took an hour and forty-five minute nap!! this would make an excellent baby shower gift too! thank you so much!
I have tried every single pacifier in existence over the course of four babies...and the MAM ones are the ONLY type any of my kids will willingly take. Every other one, even ones that are similar in shape, get spat right back out. It's crazy. I have friends who have said the same. I've also had no issues with my breastfed babies and nipple confusion/preference while using this paci, and I like that this brand has lots of cute designs.
These are the greatest binkys ever! My first refused any other kind but these, and yes I do believe that it's all baby preference. .. but they are easy to find,come in many colors ( which js awesome bc my older one has transitioned to the blue Super Soothie for older babies, tougher rubber for teeth) easy to wash, they work with all binky leashes and I cannot say enough good things about these especially when they keep my kids happy!!
My lo LOVES LOVES LOVES her goon goon kitty! She has used it since day 1 and is 18 months old. I wash it in the washer once a week or so and put it in the dryer in a pillow case. The pacifier part is starting to sgow wear but we are about to weam her off and just give her the animal. Perfect timing! We will most definately be buying this product for the next baby. When she was tiny I loved it bc it would help her keep it in her mouth.
these gates are a godsend and worth every penny.  my fiance and i got a german shepherd pup and baby gate jumping was completely horrible and made us feel like a prisoner in our new house.  these are easy to put together and we have two of them.  we got our first one at lowes for 10 dollars more and loved it so much we came to amazon and bought another one for $10 cheaper . highly recommended, great for big /crazy dogs like shepherds.
this sheet is exactly what i was hoping for - something soft for my baby boy and that fit generously and tailored to the crib mattress.  i had purchased other fitted sheets that were similar, but because they seemed to shrink after washing, their fit was compromised- no good.  i strongly recommend this product as the quality is excellent and just how it should be- i will definitely purchase more sheets from this company in the future.
our then 13 month old son saw this in the toy store he refused to leave without it.  he and this toy were inseperable for weeks and at eighteen months he still plays with it daily.  older children will fight to play with it.  i was surprised how popular this toy was.  in the beginning he was mostly dragging it upside down or on its side and he still loved it for some reason.  now he can make the top spin and it makes him really happy.
i have the britax b-ready and love it but it's wayyyy too heavy and i finally had enough. so, my search began for a lightweight stroller. it was between this city lite and the chicco liteway & i'm so glad i chose this stroller. it's lightweight (compared to my britax) at 15 pounds and so easy to open & close. it swivels nice & rides smooth. only pain is the dang buckles which i can live with. so far, i'm very happy with this purchase!!
i expected a more breathable texture, but for this price ($150), it is super padded and looks sturdy. heavy for sure, but guys, we get used to lift heavy stuff with baby coming. whatever, we'll put the car seat in the stroller  so... weight is not a big deal. after all, if you plan to have a c-section and weight matter, think that after a month, your strength would be back, and during that time, you could leave the car seat in the car.
We had our third baby on 12/30/10 and the hospital gave us the gumdrop pacifier for our son. This pacifier is amazing my son absolutely loves and will not take any other type of pacifier now. I wish we would have known about these with my previous children. It does not fall out of his mouth easily and they are very reasonable priced. We came home with an orange once and since then have ordered the blue ones from the Hawii medical site.
these cups are great! i didn't expect them to be 100% spill proof but they are!<br />my wife can carry this cup in her purse and there was no 1 drop leaking out and the cup didn't stay upright all the time.<br /><br />i tried to drink out of them and it is easy, so no worries that baby will suck hard and get nothing out.<br /><br />the shape is great for little hands to hold it, they are easy to clean, colors are universal- get them!:)
i bought this chair when my grandchild was born and used it for our second. it's portablility makes it a breeze to bring to a restaurant, as well as use for the home and it takes up very little space when folded. my experience is that it has been sturdy and i appreciated it being adjustable to different thicknesses of tables. this is the third one bought, two others were gifts and very much used and appreciated. i highly recommend this.
There are so many reasons your child will love this bear!  I had two wubanubs for our infant, which is all well and good.  But when he grew out of the infant pacifier and was teething, he couldnt use them anymore, they are sewn in!  This binky bear I was able to attach a teething binky to him! And take it off and put a different binky on another day, my son prefers this bear at bed time now because he cuddles him! I love the binky bear!
we opted to purchase the normal sized leg warmers (12inch length) instead of the 'newborn' size as we want our soon to arrive wee one to be able to grow into these. the quality is superb and the shipping was fast (as well as free as most of the items from judanzy qualify for free shipping!) altogether we purchased seven pairs of leg warmers, though as our wee one grows and we acquire a more ample wardrobe we will be purchasing far more.
It seemed like I was always searching for pacis for my ten month old son, so I finally caved in and bought eight at once.  We've been very happy with them.  Nuk pacis have been my favorite with both of my children.  The shape helps it stay in the baby's mouth, which is particularly nice at night.  The sports theme (which I'm not usually a big fan of) adds a sweet boyish flair to baby's daily ensemble.  No complaints about this purchase!
i love, love, love. this was a great buy for my now 7 month old who is a bit on the chunky side. it is very spacious giving her plenty of room to roll around and play with her toys. easy to put together and break down which is a great plus and the travel bag is awesome. my only thumbs down is just i wish the padding was a little bit thicker. my daughter likes to kick and sometimes i think she may hurt her little feet on the firm bottom.
My son never really sucked on binkies but he does love this one, now, at 14 months. Mostly to chew on and suck a little bit with his teething, but it is a really great pacifier. I love the natural materials and it is quite soft, more so than the silicone ones. It is a bit waxy and rubbery smelling at first but if you sanitize it before first use as it states, it goes away. The waxy part is a natural coating from the rubber and will fade.
we don't have any diaper genies and only use these baggies at home. i bought them as a temporary solution before i did more research on diaper genies. these are scented, easy to get out of a box, and easy to tie to stop smell from escaping. all i know is that baby's poop smells and keeping poopy diapers in a diaper genie for days in a room where my kid and we sleep....is gross. i throw these out a few times a day! very easy and hygienic!
this is the best footmuff/bunting we have tried for our children. it has been warm enough during 20 f weather (kids in coats, and hats as well), but has also been great in mild 50-60 f weather. it blocks the wind, and sheds water, and it zips up each side so that the child's torso can also be protected. we also love the small zipper pocket on the bottom for storing mittens or pacifier, or tissues, etc. this is super easy to wash as well!
Complete life saver. I have 3 of these and they are the BEST EVER. They stay on the childs chest when they are too young to hold it, and when they are older, they themselves can reach for it and put it in their mouths. My daughter, now 2 1/2 still loves her but the binky part has long fallen off. She now just holds the caterpillar as a stuffed animal for both her nap and bed time. Im pregnant with my second, and will be buying more ASAP.
i love this diaper bag.  it fits a lot of stuff and looks cuter than most of the loud patterned bags out there.  i love all the little pockets and places to put stuff, but i do need to be careful to remind myself regularly of what's in there because it's easy to forget.  a nice feature is the pacifier pouch on the side, which i use regularly.  the straps to hook the bag onto a stroller are nice too.  overall, very happy with my purchase!
These have been a total lifesaver for us! Our daughter got her first pacifier from the hospital where she was born, she has never taken to any other brand other than the soothie's, She had the worst time keeping it in her mouth and these have been amazing! They have now become her lovies and she can't be without them. It may be hard for her to give them up when we need to wean her from the binky. I HIGHLY recommend these to every new Mom.
My husband bought these at Walmart once right when our daughter was born and we havent been able to find them again. They are FANTASTIC. They snap shut when they hit the floor so they dont get all nasty and dirty. Super lazy parents might be turned off by them because sometimes you have to open it back up for your baby to stick it back in their mouth.<br />My daughter only likes these pacifiers and parents always ask me where to get them!
My son was given soothie pacifierss in the hospital, and we continued with them when we got home.  We got our first wubbanub at 3 months, and have not used anything else since.  We have about 4 or 5 at any time, and have lost sveral at Wal-Mart, or to a chewing puppy dog.  We just keep replacing them, and my son is happy.  He just turned one, and now he chews on the legs more than he sucks on the paci.  I wouldn't trade these for anything!
I ordered these because these are the kind of binks that my kid likes. He is very soothed by them and goes right back to sleep if Im quick enough. I saw that the colors could vary, but if I really cared that much about what color the things were I would have driven my lazy butt to the store and picked some out in person. I put the pink one up as an emergency back up and attached the green and blue one to his pacifier clip. Tragedy averted.
Can't live with out this product!!! Since day 1 til now (7months) she has used & enjoyed all these products.  Perfect for little hands & mouths. They are the easiest to clean. She gums almost every part of the wubby.  Also my dtr is so fickle that she refuses other pacifiers & will scream until I give her a Wubbanub. (I have tried other pacifiers ie dr browns, tommee tippee, etc but without luck.)  Can't say enough good about this product.
I tried tommee timpee and this other generic paci. My daughter didn't like. My niece showed me a pic of her friend's son w/ this paci and said her friend only uses this because he loves it. I remembered this was the type they used in the hospital and she loved. I brought a pack of two for her and she loves them. I didn't know they had different colors. I'm going to order the pink and purple since she's a girl. These pacis are a life-saver.
My daughter was using the Soothie brand pacifier (I wanted to use it and we had gotten it in the hospital) & when I saw these I thought they were interesting, so I bought some and now these are all she'll use...interestingly enough, she can tell the difference between the two and will refuse the soothie brand pacifiers now.  I love that I can see more of her face with these and that they give her more breathing space when she has a cold...
Haha, this item was almost more for me than for my daughter. She only likes the soothies but i think they are ugly. Anyway, I heard about these Wubbanubs and got totally excited. Got it just today and my daughter loves it too. It helps keep it in her mouth without always falling out when she drifts off for a bit. Its very cute and she likes to hold on to the kitty's leg while she sucks on the soothie. She is 3 weeks old. We are pleased. :D
we bought 3 covers and originally i planned to just use them for my 21 month old for a few months before we potty train. but i gave them a try on our 2 month old baby boy and they also work well for him! i'm really pleased. i also bought the thirsties hemp/cotton inserts to use with this cover and i'm glad for that purchase too. the thirsties/bumgenius combination absorbs a lot of the wetness so i'm not changing diapers every half an hour.
started off w a different nursing bra that used a velcro closure, which i found so annoying.  besides being loud, it also was a snag hazard while you opened/closed it.  so first, i love this bra's zipper closure.  the black fabric is thick and stretchy, so supportive and comfy.  the design is also very effective ... no worries about shield or bra slippage, even though i use it without the optional shoulder straps. this is def a 5 star bra!
this paci is great for nursing moms. it helps the baby with sucking and avoids nipple confusion. it's also soft for the baby to keep in its mouth. i've tried many different ones until i got this one and my baby was hooked on it in seconds. he will actually gag on any other paci that i try to put into his mouth. this is the best product ever created. the only downside of this is that i have to order it online and cannot get it in the stores.
Be aware there are two different nipple shapes! I ordered the wrong ones the first time. Amazon graciously refunded me. My little switched from another major brand to these with no problem after I heard a disturbing story about a pacifier being swallowed into the airway because it was too small and all one piece. Yikes. These have the handle on the back that make me less nervous.<br />I like that these are not dyed as well! A grest product.
This review is based off one day's use. I got my sterilizer and dryer and immediately opened it. I previously washed about twenty bottles and put them in the sterilizer to use it right away. After four cycles of sterilizing and drying, I'm obsessed! I can't believe it how easy it works and how well it dries. There's nothing I dislike more than leaving wet bottles for days to dry on my counter. I hope this keeps working well as time goes on!
we bought a more expensive tub first and returned it, after which my mom bought us this one. needless to say, it was perfect. we used it when our baby was tiny with the little butt bumper in, and now that he's almost eight months old we use it without the bumper and he just sits up in it (i lay him down to rinse his hair). we'll use it for as long as he fits! the little orange cup is one of his favorite toys, and the price is excellent too.
i love this walker, got it for my baby when she was about 6 months, she loved it and figured out over a month or so how to turn it around and everything. now she is almost a year and chases me around the house in it. the toy that is in the tray comes out and she enjoys it both in and out of the walker. it has held up really well and is pretty easy to clean. i recommend this to anyone looking for an easy to use walker with adjustable height.
We have 4 &#34;Giraffy's&#34;, though our daughter is only aware that 2 exist at any one moment in time.  I'm not sure what she would do if faced with all 4 Giraffy's.  My guess is she's giggle.  And then rotate them so each had a turn.  There is nothing cuter than a baby with a giraffe hanging out of her mouth off a pacifier.  Oh-- and it's super easy for them to find it in the crib, and easy for them to hang onto it when they're newborns.
With our first baby we barely ever used our Wubbanub, and I wondered what all the fuss was about. But by the time our second came along, I knew how to work it into the swaddle properly to hold it in place. Now I've discovered I can't live without it. After our dog ate our last one, I went a couple hours trying to use an ordinary paci, and I just can't go back. Totally worth every penny.<br /><br />Also, why would you not buy the dragon one?
one of the best things i registered for. it's so very convenient, compact, and simple. i love that i don't have to lug my whole diaper bag around when going to a restroom to change my lo, or if we're just going somewhere for a bit and i don't need all the bells and whistles. the one drawback is that the pad is a bit small compared to other similar products. but otherwise, i've been very happy with it! skip hop makes great, quality products.
Love the item.  WubbaNub pacifiers are a sure hit for new borns.  They can quickly control it themselves and usually do not care for any other pacifier when they realize this.  The animal body is always soft and cuddly--a plus for baby and mom.  And just throw it in the washing machine or dishwasher when needed.  BabyHaven prices were reasonable and they shipped this immediately.  Makes for easy, quick and appreciated gift for any new baby.
These are great no more lost binky they are so cute get lot of people asking where I got them.  Our little one just loves them and so does her mom when sleeping she will wake and feel for it and right back to sleep they are just the right size for her little hand and when Doctor seen them she said they were great for her hand and eye coronation so they are a win win there could not think of anything bad to say about these so worth the money
We had basically weaned my two year old of the pacifier - but we bought this one to use for his Halloween costume.  It made the whole costume and was completely adorable.  We got lots of comments, and since he already liked pacifiers, he had no trouble keeping it in his mouth.  He was pretty much the cutest vampire ever.<br /><br />We only used it for that purpose - and thankfully our big boy had no trouble giving these up for good after! :)
How many times does your baby drop their pacifier, are screaming, and you have that moment of well if I just wipe in on my pant leg it'll be clean enough and it's not going to kill them.  These are a must-have in your diaper bag so you can clean them properly before returning them to your baby's mouth.  They also have a nice smell and don't leave a poor after taste as my son takes his pacifier immediately after it's cleaned with these wipes.
As a pediatric speech-language pathologist specializing in feeding disorders  I love the gumdrop.  The shape makes it ideal for patients on binasal cannula oxygen and CPAP; other pacifiers must be cut (often leaving sharp edges) to fit around medical apparatus.  I have had numerous patients' parents call after discharge requesting more gumdrops as it is the only pacifier their children will take.  So glad to see them available on amazon.com.
i previously had a set of rubber bath ducks with the holes in the bottom and unfortunately they molded. i decided i didn't want to deal with buying another set and having to glue the bottoms closed. i purchased this set and my daughter loves them! also in the future it will give me an excuse to teach her letters and numbers while taking a bath. as of right now she just loves sticking them all over the bath walls and herself and no mold! yay!
i have tried so many sippy cups for my son and the all leaked. i was a little nervous about spending money on yet another sippy cup, but this cup is great! my son is just over one and is really rough. he throws is cup in the ground all the time. this cup not only keeps his drink cold for hours, but it won't leak if it is dropped, or tipped. the only time it leaks is if i shake it upside down with a lot of force. so pleased with this purchase!
My baby wouldn't take to a soother until she was 12 weeks old and she eventually took to this one. We tried sine she was 4 weeks old but something magically happened when she was a little bit older. I only pop these in when she's fussy and needs a nap and we aren't at home. They are the only ones she keeps in her mouth longer than 2 minutes. She's now 5 months old and too old for these and I'm hoping they have a similar version for 3+ months!
I love this baby product!  My son loves his WubbaNub and at 7 months can easily put this back in his mouth which helps with self soothing.  These make the perfect baby shower gift.<br /><br />Note:  You can't removed the binkie from the stuffed animal.  To clean, just put in the wash and let air dry.  It took me a bunch of searching to figure this out.  My husband has actually sent them through the dryer a couple times without any damage too.
I work in a major NICU and have noticed that some parents buy these and bring them in for their little ones. I am due in 3 weeks with my little guy and think these are absolutely adorable. The  attached pacifiers are the same medical grade one that we use in the hospital. The babies seem to like them and the stuffed animal part seems to make it a tad easier for some babies to keep in their mouths. I will probably end up getting more of these.
we've used this car seat for over a month now.our son in 14.5 mos old presently (average weight/height).it's a great car seat,very sturdy and the fabric is stitched well.we are currently using it at maximum recline and our son has absolutely no problem falling asleep.long drives are not a problem anymore!i don't know if the fabric will work well in the summers.a very good buy from amazon at $122.target and babies'r'us have it at 150/160$+tax.
Anything that will sooth a newborn and help her feel comfortable is great in my book. These were the second type of pacifiers we tried with our newborn, and she preferred them.  It was a great tool when my husband was trying to calm her and she wanted to suck. Or when I had breastfeed her and she still wanted to suck, but I needed a break. She almost 3 months old and still prefers this pacifier, but it seems much less so.  I highly recommend!
absolutely love these leg warmers and all of my little legs' leg warmers!  the rainbow ones go with almost any outfit and are too cute for words.  these fit my six month old and my two and a half year old great!  i hadn't really believed that they would fit such a wide age range until i tried them!  my daughter is always getting compliments on her leg warmer collection at daycare by the teachers and other parents.  don't hesitate to buy them!
my three year old loved his &#34;blue blankie&#34; from pottery barn, so i got a second one just incase it went missing. after his baby brother came, he dug out a baby shower gift and began carrying around his &#34;baby&#34;.... everywhere...... almost lost him once and it was bad. insert my search to find a second one incase &#34;baby&#34; got left somewhere or lost at disney. fast shipping, perfectly new product with tags, thank you!!!!!!!!
My son had awful reflux, and I was unable to lay him down for 9 months. Seriously. Hell. This was our savior (along with the rock n' play rocker). He used them until he was 2. Literally EVERY photo of him from ages 4 months-2 years feature his beloved giraffe. We had a few on rotation, and the giraffes held up GREAT through washing (we would boil them, throw them in the washing machine, etc.) Love love love. We gift these at every baby shower!
Bought these for my little one and when we brought her home from the hospital I tried giving her this binkie but she spit it out so we continued to use the Avent Soothie. Now that she's 1month old I tried giving her this binkie and she loves it.<br />I like the fact that it doesn't come out her mouth so easily and the hard plastic around it doesn't hug her mouth like others leaving marks.<br />Also they each come with their own protector case.
This little pouch is a life saver! It easily fits 2 pacifiers with space to spare. It's so convenient not having to search through the diaper bag to find a pacifier! I also love the snap that is used to secure this pouch, it's much more secure than using velcro like other similar products use!<br /><br />Con: The loop to snap this pouch is a little small. You can't snap this on the car seat handle but it does fit well on a purse or diaper bag.
i bought this right before travelling for the first time with my 4-month-old. thank goodness i did! he really needs a pacifier handy at all times, especially when tired or fussy. however, he has just recently figured out how to pull them out of his mouth, which leads to pacis on the furniture, floor, etc. well needless to say i didn't want to risk his pacis ending up on the floor of an airplane or a sandy beach - this was the perfect solution.
i have been using this product for a long time and don't leave the house without it. i usually carry several covers in my purse. the main advantage over the paper toiler covers in public restrooms is that it wraps around the toilet seat and that is where kids put their little hands. the only disadvantage is that it is not flushable and you have to find a trash can to dispose it in and you have to be careful not to touch part of the used cover.
My daughter LOVES both of her WubbaNubs.  She has this giraffe and the monkey.  She plays with them and teethes on their various appendages.  Whoever came up with these is a genius.  So much easier for her to hold on to!  Both of our WubbaNubs have been through the wash many times and have held up to some rough treatment also.  I don't put them in the dryer, but they dry within a few hours anyway.  Great product and every baby should have one.
I bought this for a baby shower of a friend who just gave birth. I was very busy at work and couldn't shop personally so was very happy to find this gift. I was crossing my fingers that it would be all that the picture indicated. I was extremely happy when I got it. It came in a beautiful box all ready with a card on it. It arrived on time. I was very pleased and my friend loved it. Perfect for those who look for a practical yet beautiful gift!
i love these bottles! i wish i had tried them with my first baby, but there is no going back now! the only thing that drives me crazy is they don't sell the bottles with nipples for 3+ or 6+. so when i bought this set it came with newborn #1 nipples so i had to throw them out and go to the store and buy new nipples. just seemed like it was a waste that i had to go buy a different size because they don't sell them already with the size you need.
had one with my first. she loved it. was given another for my second and she loves it too. a few weeks ago we witnessed that magical moment when our baby reached out, concentrating, struggling hard and touched the toys for the first time. my second is now at 2 months and loves to either bat or kick at the toys. she loves that mirror. she loves the monkey (he is the best one) and she loves the crunchy parrot. even the music is decent. recommend.
we bought this to put in the tub for my son (9 months) after searching high and low for a bath mat that wasn't a crazy shape or didn't have a ton of cartoony, baby images all over it. this is the perfect fit! it's much larger than most of the &#34;baby bath mats&#34; you'll find and it was a lot less expensive. good quality material and not too thick, we roll it up and take it with us when we visit family and we barely notice it in the luggage.
our little guy was getting too tall for his infant seat, so we decided to upgrade him to a convertible one at 7 months. after reading tons of reviews and doing tons of research i found this one to be affordable, safe and have a smaller profile than some of the others. it seems comfortable for our boy, it spot cleans great, and was easy to install. if you're a little ocd, doing hours of research like i did, search no longer, and get this one :-)
I have a giraffe and this elephant. The giraffe is my and my daughter's favorite, although it seems to cost more than the elephant everywhere I've checked. I get so many comments from people about these. Not only are they cute, but they are also very effective. Tiny babies can find it easier and as they get older, it becomes a little like a lovey. Mine holds the ears while she nurses and then transitions to that nipple when she's done with me :)
love this crib! my daughters share a room so we did not have the space for a full size crib. i was a little hesitant to purchase this based on some of the poor reviews i read, but since it was the only one really in our price range, i gave it a shot. boy, i was not disappointed! it's the perfect size, cute, and has held up very well. i purchased the dream on me 3&#34; mattress to go with it since the mattress that is included is so ridiculous :)
i use these for the changing table. i put them where my baby's butt goes when changing so if there is any mess, i just throw these in the wash instead of the more expensive changing pad covers. they are soft and absorbent, nothing has leaked through to the other side. i have 9 of them and keep them around the house. they would be handy too if you need to change on the floor or where ever. they are small, but i just use them under the booty area.
I ordered this for my sister while she was pregnant and I'm glad I did! The blanket and burp cloth sure come in handy for swaddling & burping. We use everything in this set. All the clothes are adorable, fit well  & wash easy. Everything here makes a wonderful baby shower gift, or even are great for new moms. My only advice is to stock up on receiving blankets because they really do come in handy & you can almost not have enough with a new born.
we baught this after useing pockets for a long time and wanted a all in one for our daughter i love how easy they are to put on and take off the only thing i didnt like that as with any all in one it takes forever to dry unless you dry them in a dryer which i dont. Also these diapers will fit both small and chubby babys but im not sure if id call them one size as my daughters one (21lb)  and still fits this with it snaped all the way in and down
my son and this look obscenely cute and I love how promptly it came. Can't wait for long road trips with my little man<br /><br />UPDATE!<br /><br />I've noticed a lot of reviews that have said that the toy doesn't wash well. I've had this binky for several months, thrown it in the wash and dryer and he's been just fine. It might be the type of detergent that's being used but I use the Tide Pods and I haven't had a single issue with Mr. Bull. :)
this protectors seem to be working well and keeping our baby safe from sharp corners in our house. so far we have covered all around the corners and sides of our end stands and along sharp parts on the wall. very happy with the thickness and quality of the product as well as how much you get for the price. the 3m tape works well to get the cushions to stick to the furniture and they provide more than enough for how much cushioning you are given.
I love Wubbanubs! I bought this for my 2 month old son because I also love dragons and he likes the Soothie pacifiers.<br />He hasn't mastered the art of finding it and putting back in his mouth yet, but he does like to hold on to the body if the dragon while he's sucking on the paci.<br />I searched EVERYWHERE for the dragon Wubbanub and found it only on amazon. It's pricy for a paci, but we both love it and my son will get tons more use of it!
this trendy clutch has been a huge find for me, as i've given a number of them to new moms in my family over the past year.  every time i have received rave feedback about the combination of style and functionality.  typically, you'll find one or the other, but not both in the same product.<br /><br />i strongly recommend this product - better give them as gifts before everyone has one of these beauties!  (oh, and love the new patterns as well.)
this thing is great!  there are so many ways it keeps your baby entertained.  the wheel looks really cool when you spin it fast, it makes a fun noise (seriously, the only toy in my house that makes noise that i don't find annoying!), there are little bead-like things (don't worry, they're not coming unattached no matter what), it spins and turns, i could go on & on.  it's so worth the money, my baby is 9 m & still gets a kick out of it regularly.
This Wubbanubb is an absolutely adorable frog! My son is 8 weeks old and LOVES it already. I just got the order today by UPS. He has a puppy Wubbanubb and will be getting more soon. These are perfect for babies and the animal attached to it is small enough for little hands to hold onto if they choose.<br /><br />A friend of mine said that these CAN be washed in the machine, and dried on low as needed without ruining any of the pacifier or animal.
i love the original bumgenius elemental. unfortunately they are hard to find and can be quite expensive if purchased new. i heard about smart bottoms and that they were similar so i gave them a try. now they make up the majority of my stash.<br />they are usa made. soft, absorbent organic cotton inner. fast drying time (for an aio). the fit is great and thy come in cute colors and prints. plus the re sale value is high. can't go wrong with these.
I love this wubbanub so much, it's my favorite. However if you are looking for this wubbanub that is NOT a counterfit and doesn't fall apart, buy it from BUYBUYBABY.COM, it's cheaper. I got mine for 12.99 and it's the RIGHT one. I don't know about this one and it's way more expensive. But the wubbanubs in general are amazing. We have a lamb and a caterpillar and just bought this lamb again (on buybuybaby) for a baby shower I'm attending in April.
Someone gave us one of these as a gift and we thought it was funny until we started using it, now we can't live without it. Our favorite part about this pacifier is finding it in the bed at night. It is much easier to search for this than anything else. My daughter through the first one out of the car and we lost it. We only made it one night without it before we found this one online and ordered it. My only regret is not ordering 2 just in case.
I ordered this to keep a couple of pacifiers within easy reach in the diaper bag and it has worked out great.  The little bag fits perfectly in one of the large front pockets of the Skip Hop diaper bag.  It easily holds 2 pacifiers (I use the Avent Soothies).  I have not used the strap to attach the bag to anything, so I can't comment on the use of that.  Overall, very pleased with my purchase and received timely delivery from Amazon (as always).
My exclusively breastfed 5 month old has used only this pacifier since 6 weeks old. She refuses all other pacifiers, but loves the gumdrop. I love the design with the cut out for the nose and all one piece. It is also soft enough that if it gets lost in the bed or carseat it is not super uncomfortable or hard. It is funny looking, and slightly odd to see all the way into a child's mouth, but overall we love the product and recommend it to others.
For other people interested in purchasing, I was wondering what &#34;0 plus months&#34; meant in the description.  I just received the pacifiers and the box says &#34;Newborn.&#34;  So just FYI for other people interested in purchasing this item.  I had to give it a star rating so I gave it 5, but we actually have to return them.  Didn't want to rate as a 1 since we didn't try them and will just be returning them since the age is too young for us.
I will 5 star review every single Wubbanub I get my hands on.  I LOVE THEM.  Expensive--yes! But oh so worth it when your kid has hurled the paci under the crib for the 85th time at 3am.  Easily machine washable, and if you're moderately handy with a needle and thread, you can put a new paci in the animal's mouth when the original wears out.  The tiger is perfectly sized and ultra cute.  Wubbanubs are my go-to baby gift when a friend is expecting!
mh daughter started teething hard core<br />at about 3 months. i purchased the giraffe teething toy and it was huge for her little mouth. fell across this one while searching and purchase it. absolutely amazing. she's almost 5 month and absolutely loves it still. there's always a place for her to chew on. it's easy to hold and clean. having dogs makes keeping things smelling good hard but the scent on this toy doesn't go away  awesome teething toy
These are the only pacifiers my 7-week old likes.  I kept trying to give her the green Avent ones the hospital sent us home with and the think the nipple part is just too big for her tiny mouth to enjoy!  This one is very thin and fits perfectly between her tongue and the top of her mouth, it seems.  When she's fussy from exhaustion we try to give her this and if that's the actual cause of her fussiness, she takes it and is often instantly asleep.
I ordered the Wubbanub Monkey for my expecting daughter-in-law.  She has decided my grandson's nickname is going to be lil monkey.  I thought this would be a perfect little gift to add to my growing collection of gifts for my first grandbaby.  My daughter in law loves, loves, loves this monkey.  She said it was her favorite gift at her recent baby shower. Even though my grandson is not born yet, I am sure this pacifier will always be his favorite.
Love this!!! Got this for my son when he was just newborn. I was shopping around for a binkie for him, and when I came upon the Wabbanub's I just fell in love with them. They are just the cutes thing, it's also very good cause it doesn't go flying out, when he's sucking on it. Even as a newborn he started to hold on to it with his arms around it. We love it, we've had so many compliments about it. I'd recommend it to any mom shopping for a binkie.
i never write a review. but i live in a small house and needed more seating. everyone that sits in this chair loves it. it is so comfortable. it arrived in one piece, no assembly required. it is a heavy chair due to the rocker/swivel mechanism.  i bought the brown chair and when my 3 year old granddaughter eats snacks in it, i just wipe it off with a damp cloth and so far so good. the only thing missing is a comfy foot stool at a reasonable price.
love this rocker.  my daughter sleeps wonderfully in it.  she thrashes in the crib and this rocker keeps her snug.  while it doesn't have the vibration feature we don't miss it.  we do place a cloth between her head and pillow i case she spits up just cause we don't want to wash too frequently.  like that it pops shut and locks for easy transport. it even balances if just right when folded which allows me to set down for an extra hand when needed.
LOVE THESE!!!  You'll never lose another pacifier again!  Well, at least until they're 6 mths....so wish they would make the next age group of paci's and stiffness available in these!  I adored them and my daughter had nearly 5 mths of struggle trying to switch to just the plain soothies when she outgrew these younger stiffness wubbanubs.  She still throws a fit when they're in the store but unfortunately even at 20 mths they just chew them apart.
When I first got it I thought it looked a lot smaller in person then in pictures and it was lighter in weight than I had thought it would be. I thought I would not like it . I gave it a try and my baby loved it . He is so attached to it , and since he holds on to the toy the paci doesn't fall out of his mouth every second. I clean mine in the washing machine. I am buying another one since it takes some time to dry. Over all happy baby =happy mommy
WubbaNubs are the best. They make the binkies harder to lose, easier for the baby to grasp and put back in their own mouth, and less likely to fall out of the crib onto the floor (although it still happens, I suspect on purpose). And it would make it easier to keep track of whose is whose, if I hadn't long ago given up on trying to keep the twins' germs separate. And of course they are so cute (the WubbaNubs I mean...but also my babies of course)!
Out of all of the pacifiers that we have tried, this is the only one that works. The pricing also makes this one the best bang for your buck. This pacifier has been very helpful in soothing our newborn. It has saved us from many a sleepless night. If he's not hungry, all we have to do is pop it right back in his mouth and he soothes himself to sleep at night. We have ordered this pacifier over and over and will continue to do so for the next month.
we bought this car seat for my husband麓s car (we only had one in my car).  the one i have is the britax blvd and this graco comfortsport is comfortable, and very secure (check the consumer report ratings, very high security wise).  the only bad thing was the head support, we ended up removing it and my toddler doesn麓t need it anymore...it still is not a big deal  overall highly recommended for its safety reviews, comfort and price!  great purchase!
We haven't had this product very long, and my kid isn't one of those that needs a pacifier all the time. Still, I ordered this product hoping that it would help him keep it in his mouth when he fell asleep with it. It's pretty good at that - but also, it's soft and fun to look at and even though we've only had it a week or so, my son will grasp it and try to get the pacifier back in his mouth. It seems to comfort him, and that's good enough for me!
These are the same pacifiers provided in our NICU, which means our little one had a preference for them when we left the hospital. Unlike the other gumdrop pacifiers these ones have a slight dusty texture to them and aren't slick smooth.<br /><br />I never noticed the orange scent on them but that didnt matter. These are durable and the cut out on the top helps keep the pacifier in the baby's mouth because it not bumping up against the baby's nose.
LOVE IT!! 8 MONTHS LATER ITS STILL AS GOOD AS NEW, I WASH IT BY HAND ONCE EVER 7-10 DAY WITH A SMALL AMOUNT OF DREFT AND DAB OF BLEACH... SOAK IT AIR DRY IT (OR BLOW DRY IT IF I NEED IT FASTER)<br />dEFINITELY WOULD RECOMMEND THIS... BUY 2!!!!  I DIDN'T, BUT WHILE ONE IS DRYING WIT WOULD HAVE MADE LIFE SO MUCH EASIER TO HAVE A SECOND ONE!  BUY THIS YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT! FOR YOUR BABY OR A GIFT, INEXPENSIVE, BUT WOULD MAKE AN AMAZING SHOWER GIFT!!
I absolutely love this pacifier. They are easy to hold onto. When I need to be hands free I just stick the little tab in my mouth haha. Also the little hole in the middle is convenient. When my son is first trying to latch onto it I can put my finger in that and help him get a better grip on it. It's also really funny to look at. Lasst but not least, they are the only types of pacifier that my son will use. He loves them! They're a lifesaver for me.
My son has used his froggy and ducky since he was two months old and he is now 21 months old.  He loves them!  We have had both since he was months old and never lost either of them.  We have had a couple of scares but were able to go right back to the places we were and find them right away.  I buy these for everyone I know who is having a baby.  At least one out of two people I have gotten them for use them on a regular basis.  They are ingenious.
This product has been a hit for my daughter and my new grandson.It is quick and easy and beats boiling water and waiting 5 minutes. Just put in the pacifiers up to 5 and pop into the microwave and it is done. Sterilising in no time. It fits perfectly in any diaper bag and is a must for those on the go. I would definitely recommend this as a great baby shower gift or just for your own use. GREAT PRODUCT. Wish we had these when my kids were growing up!
my daughter uses this while she's teething and when i feed her. it's an easy way to prevent getting things on her clothes, since the bib is quite large. the material is so soft! and, the designs are very cute. this is a must have item! i love that you simply just pull it over baby's head and it stays on, unlike other bibs. it makes it easy when i clean up after feeding her because all i do is use the bib to wipe her down and nothing ever gets on her.
I hated these things before I had kids. I thought they looked so weird! However, I had to eat crow on this one after a friend gave us an Elephant wubanub and it was the only pacifier our kids would keep in their mouths! I think it's something to do with the toy being slightly slightly weighted that helps the babies keep the pacifier in instead of spitting it out because they can't keep the regular soothies with no toy attached in their mouths at all.
When I saw that there were only a couple elephant rattles left in stock, I decided to purchase it from my own baby registry and I am so thankful I did! This rattle is true to the picture and is very plush with a firm, round spot (the rattle) near the rump. I love that the rattle is inside the elephant so that the pieces can never become a choking hazard and that the shape of the rattle allows for multiple easy to hold places for an infant or toddler.
These pacifiers are one of the better all around designs we've found. The cutout for the nose means our daughter does not spit it out as much and the nipple is soft enough but substantial enough to keep her interested. An added loop makes it easy to attach a strap or, more importantly, loop around your finger during the inevitable hold where baby is refusing. The clear plastic also makes it easy to see if something is on it or if it's worth cleaning.
i purchased one of these in hopes of finding a solution to grandpa leaving his depends lying on the floor or bathroom counter when he takes them off.  he just moved in with us and the smell was not pretty.  i bought the one with the blue polka dots and put it in his bathroom and he took to it easily and quickly.  now i just go in and grab the bag, knot it up and throw in the garbage can.  the bags don't rip apart and they keep the smell to a minimum!
i can't say enough about this play matt; it's great quality. we got ours already used three years ago, my son loved it, now my daughter; it's been through 3 or 4 kids and it still looks like new. the toys are engaging and moveable the lights and butterflys are what makes it so great for younger babies and i love that it has a low setting for volume and 'nature sounds' for when you cant take anymore toy music and the shake option to save battery life.
We had two of these and our daughter loved them, so.... we got sick of finding them or cleaning them.  Hey, they're cheap, right?  So I ordered 6 sets of 2.  12.... so we'd have 14 total.  Within 3 days of all 12 arriving, being sanitized and ready for use, she stopped using a pacifier.  Argh... or... YAY?  Frustrating I bought, opened, and used them all immediately.  Awesome that theres no weening her off a pacifier.  All in all, I consider it a win!
The local hospitals use these in the nursery but their are vanilla scented. Hold on to those pacifiers! The unscented take a little longer for our little ones to find comfort using.<br /><br />I like that the soothie portion is the same as on the Avent feeding system. I think it's comforting for baby to have same feel and shape when being fed for the first few months.<br /><br />These pacifiers last for a long time. I would recommend them to new moms.
the first awesome thing about this toy is that it is machine washable, air dry only. i think it鈥檚 silly when kid鈥檚 toys are spot clean. you鈥檙e really not going to get a baby toy clean with spot cleaning, especially when the toy is meant to be a teether. the toy has a hanger and clacking beads, as well as different textures, including crinkle paper. so far, my son likes it, especially since it makes clattering noises when he bangs it against the floor.
This is the fifth pacifier we tried for my breastfed baby boy. He took the Soothie initially, but stopped that pretty soon. We tried Nuk, Tommee Tippee and the Munchkin Latch and he hated them all. My mother kept recommending this paci, it's the one she used for me as a baby...I wished I had listened to her sooner, he took to this immediately. It's very easy for him to keep in his mouth, even with jostling him around while picking up and putting down.
my daughter who i bought this for isn't due for 2 more months, so we haven't actually used any of this set yet.  i can say that we got it very quickly and that it is as cute as (if not cuter than) the picture.  i plan on painting the room a girly turquoise color that i think will go really well with the colors in the bedding!  as a shopper, i would have liked more pictures to view when purchasing this, but i am very happy with the product we received.
we've had this book since our son was 4 months old and read it to him daily.  he absolutely loves it!  he's now 8 months old and squeals with pure delight whenever we say \\peek a boo\\ and reveal what's behind the flap.  it's one of the best baby purchases we've made.  i really like that it's cloth so it stands up to a lot of punishment unlike the board books.  it also doesn't have that annoying velcro book closure like some of the other cloth books.
exactly what i was looking for. no cutesy designs, just a good bib with an absorbent top, waterproof liner and a soft back. for droolers these bibs are a must. you can even tuck them under the clothing to keep the little one dry. the absorbent layer seems to wick moisture from the clothing and the soft under-layer is comfy against their skin. for kids with special needs who may have trouble managing their secretions (and drool a lot) these are a must.
i bought this for my 4 month old and love it! i thought it might be too big and take up a lot of space but it doesn't, it is the perfect size. it is also really cute. at first my baby girl didn't like it much but it only took a minute to realize it was because we needed to adjust the strap so it was higher (she is super tall for her age)... i recommend this product! baby likes it, easy to store and fun to watch your little one jump or swing around. :)
I don't normally write reviews, but I felt compelled on this one.  We REALLY wanted to find a single piece pacifier that the baby could chew on, and it would not mold/mildew like normal paci's.  They were easy to find for 0-6mo, but not over 6mo.  THESE ARE PERFECT for over 6mos.  ONE PIECE, EASY TO CLEAN, NO MOLD/MILDEW, DURABLE, CAN CHEW ON ALL SIDES.  And a bonus is that is looks like they have a pink or blue 'smile' all the time.  GREAT PRODUCT!!!!
These are the only pacifiers that my baby will accept since she was a newborn. She is breastfed and I even tried giving her the breastfed baby safe kind of pacifiers that are shaped differently, but always spit them out but she always held on her her MAM pacifiers.<br />Great brand!<br /><br />(I've always picked mine up in Walmart so I don't have to play around with being shipped the wrong color, I don't have patience for that kind of funny business!)
my grandson loves this toy!  i thought this was too expensive, but after seeing how much he loves it, i bought this one for my house and one for my nephew's baby.  my grandson bites on different parts from the nose, back and legs as different parts are harder than others.  his sophie is actually getting softer as he chews it so much.  it is a must have teether toy even at the cost.  he is 7 months old and has been chewing on this for several months now.
We have tried several other brands of natural pacifiers and this one is our favorite. It seems to be of the highest quality, smell the least weird (though they all smell weird when brand new), and have the best shape. In fact, this is the only one I have bought more than one of and I will continue to do so as needed. Stay away from natursutten- the nipple sticks to the outer ring making baby really frustrated when they go to put the paci in their mouth.
My husband thinks it's adorable that he can see how her mouth works and getting the 2 package is the best idea. (Learn now, never buy ONE of a baby thing) we keep one downstairs and one upstairs and in case of emergency we are always aware of where they are since one is pink and the other is purple. No mix up of is this paci 1 or 2. Great purchase, arrived rapidly and thank goodness because mommy was beginning meltdown mode of baby not wanting ANYTHING!
I cannot say enough about these pacifiers!! My sons LOVED them. Neither baby would take anything else, we tried various options, even some that were very similar- they were not fooled! They HAD to have the GumDrop pacifiers. They have both since been weaned, easier than I thought, but I buy them for all of our friends and their babies love them too!<br />You can buy the vanilla scented ones from the hospital nursery. *The scent goes away in a few weeks.
I will buy one of these WubbaNubs for every baby shower in my future.  My baby prefers the soothie style pacifier but could not hold it in her mouth on her own.  The turtle holds it in for her, or nearby, so she can replace it in her mouth when it falls out.  Also the  plushie is great for practicing holding onto toys and using hand muscles.  She sometimes likes to chew or suck on the plush part, so it gives a variety of textures for baby's development.
my son is a very lite sleeper. he had difficulty falling asleep. this really saved us, its smooth motion helped him fall and stay asleep for a long time. very sturdy and reliable.<br /><br />ofcourse because we used it so much and so often (my son loved the swing and would relax in it even after he woke up :))<br />the motor stopped working when he was 6 months old, but graco sent a new one promptly. excellent customer service!<br /><br />i love graco!!
Love these binkies! While my daughter prefers the orthodontic ones, I couldn't review the rounded for any lower because these pacifiers are truly remarkable. My daughter has a tied tongue, not enough to get it snipped but we tried every binky out there and at 3mos old, took the jump to try a 6mo & up size. What a world of difference! If your LO has latching issues with binkies, try a size up. Best advice I can give! She's 5mos now and still loves these.
My doctor recommended this brand of pacifier. Baby doesn't have marks on his face when he uses it. I trust this brand, and it's orthodontic, so I'm not as concerned it'll hurt his developing teeth. Baby immediately formed a latch to this, and it STAYED IN. Although, I would recommend you buy the 8 pack of them for less money per pacifier, free shipping with prime, a MUCH better deal. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00913D9EQ/ref=oh_details_o04_s00_i00
I love these!!!! My aunt gave me a set of normal MAM pacifiers, which we love. The glow in the dark set is fantastic for middle of the night feedings & other emergencies. No more crawling around in the dark patting the floor in search of the missing pacifier! They charge up in about 5 seconds when held up to a light and stay charged for hours. The glow does not seem to bother my son & we love it because it is a mini glow stick for sleep deprived parents.
havent used it yet but its really nice for the price. my note 3 phone fits in the phone slot, and our galaxy tab fits in the tablet slot as well. it has a cute little pacifier pocket as well. my only beef is there arent pockets on the inside, but i may go buy an insert to solve that. the quality is really nice, feels durable. the changing pad is small, dont expect a big one. the wipes compartment snaps pretty well, i guess that will have to wait for use.
I have a few pairs of these and they work great.  I don't just use them for nighttime... I use them all day long.  The good thing is that avent pacifiers can be found anywhere... so just in case you lose it you can pick up another quickly.<br /><br />The only thing I didn't care for is that you have no control on what color is sent to you.  The description states clearly that colors are random packaged.  Luckily for me I received the blue set for my son.
i love this mobile. the craftsmanship is fantastic! each elephant is colorful without being overboard and the material is very soft. it is a wind-up mobile so it doesn't play continuously but that's not a drawback in my eyes. my son seems engaged by the movement, colors, and the music when it's on. my toddler daughter seems to really like it too. i've caught her reaching for the mobile on more than one occasion so it's a hit with all age ranges it seems.
I bought this for my 2 month old who hated being in his car seat and in the back seat by himself. What a Life Saver!!!<br />I don't have to play...Where is the binky game?! and now my son loves staring and talking stories to his monkey friend. I totally adore it and no more car rides with an upset baby! It has made my car rides a lot easier and so pleasant. I plan on getting the Frog for his bouncer...Its an Awesome product...Get it...You won't regret it!
I wanted to get the First Years brand, but had a hard time finding it, finally I gave up and bought this one. No Regrets!! My son has tried Nuk and the Playtex pacifiers so far he doesn't like them, he would keep spitting them out and cry. I finally gave him this pacifier last night and he loved it! He sucked on it and didn't want to let go of it. I love how it isn't too hard for him to bite on. Its just right for him. I recommend this pacifier to anyone!
Our son was born in Germany, and someone sent us one of these womb bears. I and the entire staff of the newborn nursery were totally shocked when the sound was piped in over the intercom to the newborn nursery and the entire place settled into blissful sleep within about 45 seconds. I always give these as a shower gift since then. It certainly saved our sleep. However, it is important to note they seem to work only for about the first 90 days after birth.
my two-month-old loves this! i don't think she really enjoyed it until she was over a month old. now at two-months, she's enjoying it even more. she especially likes the apple with the mirror. she'll look at that for five or ten minutes while i'm doing some quick clean up or grabbing a bite to eat. she also bats at the other animals and makes them jingle.<br /><br />i've used this a lot and it's machine washable (mostly), which makes for easy cleaning. :)
I highly recommend this product to everyone out there who is struggling with their breastfed 2 month old baby to latch on a pacifier! I have got a collection of over 10 kind of pacifiers and  nothing worked but this... Of course with a bit of a struggle...<br />If your little one pushes the pacifier and does sucking reflex in her/his sleep I would say with more practice your baby would beautifully latch on this paci but with more practice not from one go!
8 of us played this at a shower and it was a big hit.  super cute.  no, it's not the highest quality baby pic...etc..and you do have to cut the binkies out with scissors, but i figure who cares....and if you have a big kid or a teenager at home, have them cut it out for you.  it's no big deal.  it's such a low price, it's worth it.  it's just a game that takes a few minutes anyway.  it doesn't have to be perfectly amazing.  it's just simply fun..and cute.
These pacifiers are so great, they are the only ones my little guy will use!<br />perfect for car trips because they don't fall behind them in the seat when they spit them out.<br />Especially when he gets upset in the car he hugs onto the stuffed animal part, and it clams him down.<br />also it's much esier to find in the diaper bag than those tiny pacifers that fall to the bottom and get all gross.<br />my advice is get several... and keep in every room!
this item has worked perfectly from the day my daughter was born.  i was nervous about baby bathtubs, especially for newborns, because i know how slippery they are when wet (not to mention soapy!) and how scrunched up they are for the first couple months. this tub comes with a \\baby hammock\\ my husband calls it, so you aren't trying to keep the infant in place while trying to get them clean.  as a new mom, you learn to appreciate stuff that really works.
My little guy LOVES this!  It serves as both his paci and lovey, so it is his go to item right now, and has been for about 4 months (he's 9 months now). The monkey's feet are the perfect size for little hands to grasp, and the whole thing is machine washable. My son also chews on the monkey's tail to soothe his sensitive gums when his teeth are coming through.  I received our first one as a gift, and purchased 2 more to have handy. I highly recommend this!
I bought this for my son, now 15 months, when he was about 7 months old. He learned to put in his pacifier by himself. Now that he's older, he holds it by the giraffe and pops it in his mouth. What's nice is that when he's finally weaned from the pacifier, he can still play with the giraffe. He owns this one and a monkey and he loves loves loves them both!! He can recognize it from across the room and run towards it. People find it hilarious when they see h
In my practice the majority of my patients are infants and children. In my office and in the nursery we offer the soothie pacifier for comfort and infants who will not suck on another pacifier are comforted by the soothie. The wubbanub was originally recommended to me by one of my patients mothers. She has triplets and stated it was a lifesaver. My granddaughter who is 4 months old has both the frog and now the monkey wubbanub she and my daughter love them.
this is such a cool product!  i got this as a baby gift for one of my friends that has a small child under 2 and also has one that is not quite a year.  she is the kind of mom that makes her own baby food.  she likes that she controls what is in her child's food.<br /><br />you can freeze this and just pop out what you need.  you can also write on the top what is inside because it cleans up easy when you wash it.<br /><br />this is the perfect gift for her.
Every baby seems to have their preferences for pacifiers, but this one stuck after we tried the soothie and Mam.  We used the soothie when she was a newborn, and then transitioned to this one at around 2 months.  We found this one to be the easiest for her to keep in her mouth.  Now she's 7 months and the little handles have become quite a toy for her to play with so she pulls it out of her mouth readily, but I imagine that would be the case with any brand.
we bought this changing table for our living room - which is one floor below our son's bedroom where his larger table/dresser is. we wanted a smaller option that let us change him downstairs without having to do so on the floor. it is terrific. we use the bottom shelves for canvas storage bins to hold diapers and toys. simple, classic design that fits in perfectly with our contemporary decor. works great in a room with furniture that is dark brown and black.
this is a neat baby bed!  i love that we can roll it from room to bed, it fits very nicely through the door frame.  we've found it works amazingly well with the baby monitor, we just aim the monitor at the mirror end and we can see the whole bed clearly.  i like the smaller size since our granddaughter only visits occasionally and this is very easy to store.  the mattress is a nice thickness and fits snugly in the bed.  couldn't be happier with the purchase!

I was looking for a pacifier case, and this was perfect! Not only is the price great, but it also serves its purpose. It keeps pacifiers clean, and this case is a nice compact size to fit in my bag. It's made of nice quality and sturdy plastic, and I like how securely it snaps close. The loop doesn't seem as sturdy, but I don't use the loop, so it doesn't matter to me. It fits one pacifier no problem. but you can squeeze two in there, depending on the brand.
this is hands down the best baby monitor on the market. we've had it for 9 months with no problems.<br />the camera can move side to side and even zoom. there is a microphone so you can speak to your baby if you want to.<br />the screen can time out, lighten or darken, and you can use more than one monitor while using 1 screen. we have also dropped this screen on multiple occasions and it has survived with no scratches.<br />this is the monitor you will want.
i use these diaper sacks everyday several times a day.  i have two little ones in diapers and all poopy ones go right into one of these bags and then walked to the garbage outside.  i also keep several in the diaper bag not just for dirty diapers, but also for little clothes that get messy.  i find they are the perfect size and they have a nice scent too.  i love this box because they dispense easily and sit right next to the wipes on my kids' changing table.
My newborn girl loves this pacifier.聽 The first time she tried it was at the hospital and they gave me 2 of them to take home, since the one they give are the standart blue with MAM written on it, I wanted something cute for my girl, so I bought from another brand that looked way nicer, but my baby wouldn't take it, so I checked online and found these and I love that they're exactly the same shape than the pacifier they gave me at the hospital but super cute.
My baby boy loves these. He uses them all the time. When he wakes up in the middle of the night i give him the pacifier and he goes right back to sleep. Also when he is crying he stops crying when i give him the pacifier. Its also nice that it glows. Highly recommend to all mommies with babies. These are the only pacifiers that my baby liked. I bought him other pacifiers from other brands and he doesn't like them. These are the only ones so far that he likes.
i didn't research much about high chairs for kids, as it gets exhausting - every time we need something it means days spent online and in stores comparing different options. this time decided to trust to peg perego's brand and wasn't disappointed. the chair is very sturdy built, the baby is secured in place even if the tray is off, the fabric is easy to wipe. i also love that it is easy to fold and it stands on it's own folded. would recommend it to a friend.
i love blocks, so does my nephew. the difference is i enjoy construction, he enjoys catapulting them across the room, much to my sisters dismay as they crash through anything in their path. these solve that. he can build, chew and even launch them, all without breaking anything (or anyone) the colors are great, and it seems to be something that has kept his attention. he is 18 months now and has had them for about a year. they also seem to be holding up great!
this is a great product i've used it with my son several times like most people say after about 90 minutes there is some discomfort however i have noticed i find myself holding him while in the carrier (this will alleviate a lot of the pressure on your back )or i will have him do his practice standing on surfaces while we're out together<br /><br />overall for the value this is a great product i would most definitely buy it again great product and a good price
I bought these for my 4 month old son. He has loved the original Soothie, so I wanted to try these, the &#34;Super Soothie&#34; as they call it. They are stiffer and the rubber base is a bit thicker. He really enjoys them. I think they feel more like a finger (which is his usual preference if he can grab someone's hand!) He likes to switch between the softer and harder ones depending on his mood. I just wish they made the WubbaNubs with the option of this one.
My daughter is 2 months old.  When she was born they gave a soothie pacifier at the hospital. She won't take any other pacifier and they are easy to lose and impossible to find in the dark.  This product is great because you can find it in the dark, it help to keep it in easier by having the monkey laying on her chest, and when she is not sucking on the pacifier she is holding the monkey.   This may be the most valuable purchase we made for our little addition
this is the best sleep sack i have found and i did a lot of looking.  it is cotton and of a decent threadcount so it is soft.  and unlike most other sleepsacks, the zipper is on the side so it doesn't scratch against his face.  my 10 month old son began sleeping through the night immediately after we bought this sleepsack...coincidence?  only wish they made an even warmer option as it gets cold here in the winter and we like to keep the furnace lower at night.
these are very cute. bought 2 of these for my grand twins, and 1 extra. they haven't used them yet, but they seem to be a good size. year old twins, that are used to sippy cups already, but i like modern unusual things. also says that they are upper rack dishwasher safe, and 9 oz is a nice size. should be easy for their little hands to hold, and not easy to spill! they come in such cute colors! and if you get more than one color you can mix and match the caps.
I am a firm believer in pacifiers.  They help soothe the baby and prevent thumb sucking later on.  I always made sure I had at least 6 on hand at any given time.  I really like this Munchkin pacifier.  I got it because I wanted to have a couple sterilized and on hand when my friend needed a last-minute babysitter for her newborn.  Her little girl loves these.  I always add pacifiers to any baby shower gift I give friends.  Now, I will make that brand Munchkin.
received quickly and as described.  this mirror is very easy and quick to put together and attach to the seat. the large mirror lets you see what the baby is doing clearly and you can adjust it to whatever angle is good for you.  i like that it is shatterproof for safety reasons.  this is a must for the car using the rear facing baby seats.<br /><br />i received this at a discount for my unbiased honest opinion.  these are my own words after trying the product.
Having three children I decided to go with the walker. We never used one before because it was never recommend by Dr's. This center is the best. It has stoppers so don't fear your little one can't move. Pull them out and you can push them from room to room with you with the handy holder in the back. The baby loves it and I think it's great. Also, Mom's who have taller babies this one lasts longer than the average bouncer;seems it adjusts higher than the others.
this play yard was even nicer than i expected. you can see the 4 legs for support, but there is also more built in support underneath.  the construction is heavy duty yet not heavy.  setup takes less than a minute and there is lots of play room.  you could easily put more than one child in the play yard and still have plenty of room for toys. it also comes with a nice soft cotton blend sheet. this play yard is the best quality i have seen and i am very pleased.
My little girl loves this toy, and she doesn't even really go for pacifiers usually.  I love how dino is easily grasped and she hasn't lost him yet (she's 7 months old now)!  She likes to chew/suck on the pacifier itself, the sides of the pacifier, and dino's nose, hands and feet.  As for cleaning, the tag says not to machine wash or submerse, but I usually just use a little soap and suds him up by hand, let him dry overnight.  Dino seems no worse for the wear.
somehow the gate gods were smiling at me the day i bought this gate.  i have 5 dogs, and i can't keep them out of the dining area.  the width of the opening from the dining area to the family room was 130 inches, and this gate opens up to 144inches.  i had to find out this information from the reviews....as amazon doesn't really post a description about the products..unless i'm missing something.    anyway    love this gate!  it's cute and keeps out my 5 beasts!
i love my jj cole broadway stroller and the new color canopy gave it a more fresh look!!<br />i receive compliments all the time on the stroller and people are constantly asking me what it is.  in fact because i have this stroller and people love how easy it is to steer two families from our church had asked me where they can purchase one an they did.  it's a wonderful stroller and the fact that they have different canopy colors makes it so much more appealing!!
We bought every cute pacifier under the sun for our daughter but she will only take the First Years GunDrops. Good thing they come in a bunch of colors and we just accessorize with paci straps. This six pack is a total steal and now we don't have to worry that we'll ever find outselves without one in case the dog eats one or one gets left at grandmas or whatever just seems to happen with babies and pacifiers. Do yourself a favor and get a bunch to have on  hand!
These pacifiers are the same kind that I got from the NICU for my daughter and she would not use any other brand or shape. This is the only place that I was able to find these pacifiers and not have to by a whole box. I ordered these and contacted them to fix something on my order and they were very nice and helped me out without any problems, PLUS they still got shipped to me very quickly.   My daughter loves these and the colors are so much cuter than Soothie.
Our son loved his WubbaNub! He just recently gave up the pacifier, but up til now, he looked forward to going to bed each night so he could spend time with his WubbaNub. It helped him find his pacifier at night so we didn't have to go into his room and find it for him, and it works like a stuffed animal too, giving him comfort from the personality of the animal. If our second son, born recently, desires a pacifier as well, we'll be getting him a WubbaNub as well.

My baby loves this soother and it's great when he's fussy or in between feedings. I got this kind because it was recommended to me by other moms and I was told it's the kind that they use at hospitals. Although I waited to use the soother until about 5 weeks because I was worried about interfering with breastfeeding, it hasn't been an issue at all and it use it now multiple times a day and it sometimes even works to put my baby to sleep. I'd definitely recommend.
this straw cup is a life saver (as with other nuk sippys). it is the only straw cup i can find that doesn't leak! my daughter was very ready to transition from a rubber sippy cup to a straw cup but all the ones i would find in the store leaked like crazy. i finally found these on amazon and decided to give them a try. i've since bought many more. it is almost impossible to find them in stores near me as they are always sold out so i snatch them up whenever i can.
i got this for my 22 months daughter.  she still has times on my ergo, but mostly it is reserved for my 5 months old.  she loves dolls and copies everything i do.  she loved her own ergo!  i was reading the reviews and was ready to use the strap from the box to keep it in place; but this was not needed as her ergo came with a back buckle! just like mine! it stays in place and she is happily taking her doll for walks as her mommy takes her baby brother!  we love it
My daughter is a breastfed baby and I was afraid to give her any pacifier at first.  But when the screaming constantly got to be too much, I decided to give this one a try.  Heaven!  She only sucks it for brief periods until she calms down and when she's done, she is DONE, she spits it out with a disgusted look on her face that is too funny.  But it has caused no nipple confusion and it does what it's intended purpose is, stopping the screaming.  Highly recommend!
Our daughter is two months old and has been using these pacifiers since the first few weeks of life. Unlike other pacifiers that we have bought (soothers, etc), the outside of these pacifiers are not heavy and fit well against the newborn/infants face and mouth, therefore they don't fall out as easily when they stop sucking. Also, the holes along the edges make it easy to attach to a pacifier clip and attach to a seat or the babies clothing. A must for new babies!
My son was given a GumDrop Paci at our local children's hospital after undergoing surgery.  He took to it immediately and seemed very calmed by the vanilla scent.  After using it for a week in the hospital, he no longer cares for his other pacis.  The pacifier is very soft and fits to his face without leaving marks.  It is one piece construction and does not get filled with soap or water when washed.  My only wish is that the vanilla scent came in multiple colors.
after much research (both online and sitting in chairs) this is the most amazing one there is. it is so comfortable for both my husband and i (i'm 5'4 he is 6'3) love the reclining feature of the back (one of the huge selling points for me). the seat scoots forward when you lean back. (other chairs the back just moved back and it hurt my back)  the glide is real easy and smooth.  have not gotten to rock baby in it yet, but am sure that it is going to be fantastic.
I love these. If you have ever been down of your hands and knees trying to find a lost pacifier than you will appreciate these.<br /><br /> I was a little nervous when some reviewers mentioned how bright they are. I have wondered that myself but try don't seem to bother my baby. And one thing that helps is I only use these at night and keep them away from bright light during the day and then they don't glow very dark at night. Just enough so that you can find them!
I bought the Wubbanub for my 4 week old son because he could not keep his paci in at night. The Wubbanub would still fall out if he didn't suck constantly but it was much better than before. It is lightweight but I think the reason is so it will fall out if he spits up. Now at 7 weeks it stays in his mouth better and he wraps his hands around it; so cute.  This is definitely a great solution for anyone tempted to prop the pacifier. I bought 1 for my in utero niece.
Can't live with out this product!!! Since day 1 til now (7months) she has used & enjoyed all these products.  I breasted w/o any issues.Perfect for little hands & mouths. They are the easiest to clean. She gums almost every part of the wubby.  Also my dtr is so fickle that she refuses other pacifiers & will scream until I give her a Wubbanub. (I have tried other pacifiers ie dr browns, tommee tippee, etc but without luck.)  Can't say enough good about this product.
We LOVE these pacifiers.  My son has used them for a while and they truly glow all night.  Simply hold them up to a light before bedtime for about 10 seconds and you can find them in the dark all night.  I needed some replacement ones as our old one wore out.  I was having trouble finding retailers that carried them an ordered this set on line.  The only CON is that these are almost twice the price of the ones I ended up finding in a local baby chain store in town.
this is without a doubt my daughter's favorite thing in the world. we got her one when she was about 3 months old and she loved it from the start. just playing with those tags can occupy for long periods of time. when she got to be about 5-6 months she started chewing on the tags. we put it over her when we take her for walks or in her infant seat in the car - she never seems to tire of it. the packaging says not to put it in the wash, but i do, and it has held up.
i absolutely love how big this mirror is.  i bought it for my daughter so she could keep an eye on her own daughter without her having to turn around while driving and taking her eyes off the road.  what i didn't pay attention to was that there is a pivot that allows her to adjust and it's a feature she really like.  her daughter can see herself in the mirror and it's helped to entertain here when the travel.  not all products are worth their price but this one is.
i purchased this for my 5 month old son and it was the best money spent. after many days of research and review reading as a father that wants the safest and most durable products. this has lived up to it. the joy and happiness my son gets from the jumper is well worth it. as per the parents that reviewed it as having a pinch point with the elephant it can be lightly pulled up and turned away from the side and it is no longer a issue. i recommend this jumper fully.
the good things of these bottle are: first, the flow of size 1 nipple is really slow, my babies can not tell the flow difference between the bottle and mommy's nipple. my two babies don't have any problem on transition from breast feeding to bottle feeding. second, it does reduce gas, my baby girl is a easy-spit-up girl but this bottle helps. the only concern is the bottle need more time to clean the extra part and you need two kinds of brushes to clean the bottle.
when our daughter outgrew her tiny love small mat with hanging toys we got her this. we still put the small mat on this because she likes to sit next to it and grab things. i took the advice of another reviewer and cut the stringed leaf teether off of the mat, just in case she rolls around with it and gets it caught around herself. she loves the teether all by itself anyway. it's a well made mat, and i like that it folds up pretty compactly to put away every night.
i don't like a lot of baby gear and i definitely wouldn't consider this a &#34;mom necessity&#34; by any means, but it's a nice bonus. stays shut very well. allows me to not have to carry around a monster-sized package of wipes for a quick little outing with the baby. slim and durable. it's also nice to go to in the middle of the night and not have to hear that awful crinkly sound of the plastic packaging that wipes come in. plus, it's cute... i have the anchor one.
I tried about 30 pacifiers (yes, really) on my newborn and this nipple type shape was the only shape she liked but the problem I was having with so many pacifiers was that the rim was too big and they would wedge up against her little nose. This one gave her nose enough clearance so that she could comfortably use it. It was also nice that it had a little tab on the back with a hole in it so that I could attach a clip cord to it to keep it from falling on the ground.
we have been using charlie banana cloth for a while but i was gifted some disposable liners (no idea the brand) and just recently ran out so i ordered these. we love them. first of all because they fit the diaper perfectly. my last liners were too big and i had to fold them. the charlie banana liners are so so soft! they catch all the poo and we flush them and have had no problem with them clogging the toilet. i will continue to use these as long as we cloth diaper.
this is a great gown for giving birth and i'm so glad i ordered it! i want to feel more like me on the day i deliver, and this comfy, nice looking gown is way better than any sterile, awkward hospital gown. i purchased mine in solid black and it looks really chic for what it is! (who knew you could describe a labor gown with the word 'chic' right?!) the cotton is super soft and i won't be showing the world my butt as i walk around in labor. great price, i recommend!
My daughter just turned one.  Even though the age limit to the wubbanubs is 6 months, she LOVES hers and can't live without it!  We are trying to wean her off of it, so we have 3 of them:  one is the regular wubbanub, one has a tiny part of the tip of the paci snipped off, and the third one we removed the paci all together so it looks like a regular horse.  We're transitioning to the snipped off one, then to the one with no paci on the end.  They are a great product!
My husband and I were so afraid to offer a pacifier given how hard I was working on establishing breastfeeding. However, our little girl has such a strong suck reflex and need for comfort that it was best for her. This was the only brand that she would touch. We tried five others and she spit them out. The size is amazing for newborns. She is 6 weeks and still uses it. There has been no nipple confusion at all with this. We are so grateful and highly recommend these!
We were given one of these pacifiers at the hospital and our son refused any other pacifiers once we got home.  We ordered the six pack because we couldn't sterilize the one fast enough to make the baby happy!  The package arrived quickly.  I like that these pacifiers do not have the deep bump at the end of the nipple (like the pacis meant for 3+ month babies), so they don't catch in his throat and gag him (which is what would happen with other regular shaped pacis).
it is not very easy to fill with a spoon. i am also a little confused where the max fill line is. my one year old likes it, 3 year old prefers the &#34;real thing&#34; (the store bought pouches). i was very skeptical and feared that there will be leaks or explosions, but so far (2 weeks) so good.  i upgraded by rating from 4 to 5 stars. after my review the company contacted me and give some suggestions about the fill line. such a wonderful customer service! thank you!
I love these pacifiers. My daughter started using other pacifiers that would touch her cheeks. She had such sensitive skin that she would get rashes from them. So I thought I would try these and LOVED them. They stay off her cheeks and I loved that they would flex like a nipple. She loved them and they look really cute. The only problem is that you have to order them from online because they are not sold in stores anymore. I would order these again for my future kids.
These a good pacifiers.  My daughter prefers the ones with the same nipple as the soothies that she used in the hospital.  These have the same nipple but with a bit harder, more contoured surround.  If your kids don't like the super soothies, but you're worried about them bending the soothies too much (and choking on them), the gumdrops are a great compromise. These are also a great option if you use a pacifier leash because they provide an additional hole in the tab.
i'm not super thrilled about the sort of fancy edges of these however having a drawer full of solid white mittens where i can just grab any two has been fantastic.  i have to really pull on the elastic to keep them from digging into his skin but he maybe has chubbier than usual wrists and once i pull them till they pop once or twice they fit fine.  why on earth do babys socks and mittens only come in packs where you never have more than two that match each other? ugh!
We had these for our little guy and loved them! We had a pack of green/blue and the colours were great and always seemed to match his outfit :) Also we loved the clear part, i really don't like some of the other soothers that make it look like the baby has a HUGE thing hanging out of his mouth. These are nice and discreet and lasted us 0-6mths. Then once he started crawling we lost them :( and since then have lost more than 15... will buy more for the next little guy!
We have about 5 different types of pacifiers, and this ended up the only one being used because we can actually find it (unlike the other dozen that end up underneath blankets and in between cushions).  At two months, the baby has started to hold onto the arms and legs of the monkey and play with it, happy to be able to grab something.  We'll probably get another one as a back up.<br /><br />I'd put the WubbaNub a requirement to purchase prepping for a baby's arrival.
These are super cute & my son loves it! I was super anti-pacifier when my son was born, but after he kept giving himself hickies on his arms from sucking so hard, I changed my mind. He took to this right away at about 7 weeks old and now at 13 weeks he holds it and pushes it in his mouth himself-too cute! If your baby like soothies (the ones most hospitals use) then I highly recommend you get this! We had no issues with nipple confusion & he still nurses like a champ.

my daughter was less than 5 pounds when she came home from the hospital and this swaddle wrap was the one that fit her best.  it is very easy to get baby in and out of this wrap and it was much more difficult for her to free her arm from this wrap versus the halo sleepsack.  she is now 8 lbs and the wrap is a little tight on her already.  there is no way this swaddle would fit a bigger infant - i would recommend getting a bigger size if your baby is 7.5-8 lbs or more.
my daughter has been feeding herself with these utensils for a few months now (she's 20 months).  she's still a messy eater but is getting better.  she's never had any issues holding the spoons/forks.  sometimes she still needs help scooping up certain foods but the utensils themselves are good.  they were originally part of a gift basket from a relative and i had been unsuccessful in locating them in stores so i could purchase some more. i was happy to find them here.
What I love most is that this pacifier is completely rubber (no hard plastic part) so I know that if my baby accidentally rolls over it and it's under her cheek or something, it won't hurt her (and believe me, she has slept on it several times).  Even though this pacifier doesn't have a little ring you can hold on to, you can stick your finger inside it to hold onto it.  This is the one that hospitals use, plus they're easy to wash.  I just wish it came in more colors!
Leave the great pacifier debate at the door, please. Our rugrat adores these. We had tried the old-school soothies to moderate success, but the ergonomic/orthodontic shape of the nipple on these works much better at keeping these in her mouth, and keeps her happy along with it. The glow in the dark only lasts a few seconds, so don't delude yourself into thinking you'll be able to find them at night on the floor, but it's really not an issue. Great pacifiers all around.
My baby was given this type of pacifier at Northside Hospital in Atlanta and it is the only one he will take.  They aren't sold in many stores so finding them on Amazon was great.  If you can keep up with these pacifiers they'll last for a long time - the material doesn't break down like the more common brands and the outter portion is great for teething.  I highly recommend this pacifier but make sure you don't order the preemie/newborn kind... they are way too small.
i got this swing of craigslist and i started using this swing when my daughter was 4 days old she loved it she didn't quite look at mobile at time till she was a 1 month then she would stare at it in amazement she would start smiling at it all excited lol so that told me she loved it i like that it runs on electricity i haven't used no batteries and if u loose the cord or something happens to it u can buy a replacement one here on amazon  i would recommend this product
what a simple but genius idea to prevent that nasty sour-milk smell when milk or formula gets trapped in the folds of a baby's neck. the fabric is soft and absorbent, the velcro is very grippy, overall good quality (which is important since these bibs are a bit pricy compared to the average bib). despite the fact it specifically says it's for newborns, i'm still able to use it on my nearly 6-month old who is a tank and has a nice double chin going on. :) great product.
love this mattress!  most crib mattresses are hard as bricks. this one is firm enough to meet the guidelines for infant development, yet somehow still nice and soft. the memory foam compresses just enough on the surface.  seems like great quality as well. note- this item arrives rolled up in a box that seems impossibly small.  fear not- the mattress is compressed for shipping and will quickly &#34;puff up&#34; to normal size.  it did not have any foul odor upon opening.
I purchased this game for the children of baby shower guests to play so that they can feel like they were apart of the party and game time/prize winning. I prepared a small thank you bag for all the children participating in this game. They all loved playing it and it was very entertaining for the guests to watch as their children tried blindly, to attach the pacifier to the right place. Keeping this game in case I happen to host another baby shower. It was tons of fun!
I had the NUK soft orthodontic binkies for my daughter when she was a newborn. They don't make them for older children (over 6 months) though. So I searched for all-silicone pacifiers and found these.  The big ring is a bit awkward at first, but it makes it easy to put on loveys etc.  They also don't leave marks on my child's face.    I clean them every day just with soap and water and put them in one of my MAM bottles while sterilizing them. Easy as pie. Will get more.
i have the older version of this swing for my 1st boyy, who is now 5 years old. i used it for my 2nd and now for my 3rd child! i must say it is very durable, i brought the swing along with me to overseas, and several cities in my luggage ( taking apart and utting them back together, by myself with a small screw, which takes only a few mnutes!!!).  i bought 3 others as gifts. my 2.5 years old still wants to sleep in this, then i transfer him to his bed. such a life saver.
this carrier has saved our twin life! it is the best designed carrier i have ever had.  i have had an ergo, becco, mei tai.  they thought of everything: the head cover cinch down just right, both carriers are comfortable when worn separately, the pockets are large and fit a wallet and phone and keys, they all fold inside the pockets.  i have no complaints, which is a lot coming from me!  my only complaint is that it doesn't come with a full-time nanny.  i could use that!
My wife got a friggen Yankees binky for our two month old.  So I had to buy a Red Sox one.  WTF gets their kid a Yankees binky?  Luckily I ordered this Red Sox one using her Prime account so it got here fast.  They also work wonderfully.  Despite the yankees binky, they are the same type and it is the only type she will take.  I think the bulb design is a wonderful thought, especially for kids like mine, who will only take nipple shaped items.  Would recommend to others!
I have  had excellent experienced with multiple wub a nubs. Bought several for each of my kids as babies ( replacements and extras!) Easy to keep track of, unlike a small regular pacifier. Plus in the crib older babies can find it and less crying for pacis at night. When our oldest got too big for it we simply cut off the pacifier. She still sleeps with the animal. I buy these for friends having new babies. They are easy to throw in the washer as well and hold up nicely.
These pacifiers aren't just cute.  The tiny stuffed animal helps to keep the pacifier in the babies mouth.  It is much easier for babies to grab the animal and then wriggle the pacifier back into their mouth (so you don't have to.) When they do have them in the animal rests on their chest and helps to keep the pacifier there.  The pacifier part is the same kind that they give you in the hospital.  My daughter would never take a pacifier but my son did and he loved these.
Got a free one of these when we registered at BRU. Our son usually takes the Soothies pacifiers used in the hospital. He didn't seem to care for this one, and the shape makes it pop right out of his mouth. I threw it in the diaper bag for an emergency backup, but it's not my first choice. At least the silicone and durable plastic make it easy to sanitize and it comes with a hygienic cap.<br /><br />Please let me know if my review has helped you in your inquiry or purchase

we purchased this crib mattress for a vacation house. at home, we prefer to use an organic crib mattress, but they of course are very expensive. this mattress had good reviews and was very reasonably priced. it is soft and comfortable and our daughter sleeps well on it. for everyday use at home i would recommend buying a more natural mattress without harmful chemicals or plastics, but this is a good choice for an extra crib or for someone looking to an inexpensive option.
I was concerned that my 4.5 month old wouldn't like the Soothie pacifier part of the WubbaNub since she hadn't used one, but she likes it as much as her GumDrop pacifiers. She LOVES this paci because it's easier to hold and keep in her mouth. It's the only paci I've ever seen her able to put back in her mouth if it falls out (she has done that 5 times that we know of!) I love the WubbaNub because she looks so darn cute kneading the little kitty as she is sucking the paci.
i registered for this car seat. i was very concerned when i read the review that said consumer reports reccomends not buying this seat. so i looked it up. go to consumerreports.com and click on car seats then booster seats. the eddie bauer (cosco) high-backed booster seat (this one!) got an over-all rating of very good to excellent and scored either very good or excellent in every category. consumer reports says this is a great car seat!!! i am glad i \\did my research\\.
my son had baby eczema from birth until now, his pediatrician had prescribed him cortisone cream for his red dry itchy patches, behind his knees, elbows, ankles etc...i started using this body/shampoo was along with the lotion and it worked wonders, you can't even tell he has eczema besides for the occasional barely noticeable patch on his leg, i buy in bulk and it last me months its a bit pricey but i highly recommend with the use of eczema or other baby skin conditions.
my wife bought this over a year ago and we have traveled many places with it.  it is very easy to set up and take down.  it's light and easy to tote, pack and travel with.  our baby girl sleeps well in it.  my wife and i both recommend this if you are looking for a travel crib.  we've even taken it to my mom's house just for our daughter to have some place to nap.<br /><br />the bottom line is i can't even think of anything to complain about when it comes to this product.
Best investment for baby.  I bought a back up just in case we lose it.  Our baby loves holding the lovey while she sucks on the pacifier, or just to have a toy to hold.  It also stays in her mouth better since the lovey rests on her chest.  I also tuck it into the car seat or carrier so that she doesn't lose it and she usually can get it back in her mouth on her own when she wants to (4 months now).  I highly recommend these and they are my go to gift for new parents also.
My daughter loves her wubbanub! She won't take any other pacifier. She will take the plain soothie pacifier on occasion, but usually spits it out. If i hand her her wubbanub, it calms her down most of the time. She loves holding onto it. The plush toy is so easy to wash too, so no big deal if it gets dirty. I have washed it several times now and it has held up perfectly. I am very happy with my purchase. I am buying more of these in different plush animals to have for her.
My son Loves these WubbaNub Pacifiers. They have been wonderful especially at night - his can find his pacifier on his own and it doesn't fall out of the crib bars very easily. Sits great on his chest while on long car rides so he can find again when he wakes. We ended up owning 4 different character ones during the life of his pacifier using time. I'd recommend one with a dark color as they do get dirty. I'd wash them with the regular laundry and they held up pretty well.
Some folks complained about how small the 2nd bag is.  I ordered two of these at $5.99 per set.  That means I paid $11.98 for two large bags plus 2 pacifier bags, which IMO is a better deal than the $10.99 large bag 2-pack.  I wanted a way to hold pacifiers, and at $3-$8 each, I thought pacifier cases were the biggest ripoff.  This set is so worth it.  The blue and the green neutral prints are really cute!  I'm buying more of these sets for my pregnant sister and cousin. :)
i love these formula dispensers.  super useful. i use them to store formula, pacifiers, bottle caps, and other random things that my baby needs while i'm out and about. works well with dry items (never tried with wet foods).  you can take as many compartments as you need.  i love how each compartment can be opened with or without the spout which makes putting formula into the dispenser just as easy as emptying it out (without leaving any formula stuck inside the container).
no leaks, no leftover meds left behind. i couldnt believe it worked but it did. my son takes prilosec 2x a day. its DARK PURPLE and impossible to get him to take via syringe alone. we would give him a tenth of a milliliter at a time and pop his pacifier back in so he'd suck it down.  it took forever and he'd always  spit some of it out. (purple stains on everything he owns) we tried this and were shocked that it worked. he sucked down the meds in 2 seconds and didnt notice!
i really love this bottle rack. its so handy! not only does it look nice on the kitchen counter, but it allows the bottles & all of the pieces to dry completly. no more wet handtowels on the counter, where the bottles never really dry the whole way! it just snapped together. i bought it on a thursday & it came the next day! it's really nice, does the job & what a great value! i'll use it for sippy cups too when that time comes! i suggest any parent to order this. it's nice!
great design. one of the better kids accessories i have botten. i feel like my money was well spent. i have bought so much junk that gets thrown away as far as bottle and containers ect for my kids. i still use these and they are sturdy and useful. good to use the bottle strap u can get on amazon. hook it around the handle and now you can have a container of snacks on your stroller that wont spill when your kid throws it on the floor. nice soft top that dosent come off easy.
i've got twin girls and they love to potty on this seat.  the well is deep enough and even girls need the splash guard at times.  this has proven to be the best seat we own.  it's sturdy!  it doesn't tip over!  it's tall enough!  we actually use this in our van because i encourage the girls to potty before we go in somewhere so they aren't subjected to nasty public restrooms.  even with driving it while there's still pee inside isn't a problem.  it's never tipped or spilled!
i have a new dog who was a puppy mill mother... she has accidents as while living in a cage<br />for all her years she never left foot outside her cage, therefore, never learned to go potty<br />outside.  i use this to put on my couch in case of accidents.  yes this is a chance to try and<br />get the word out on how horrible conditions are for dogs breeding in puppy mills.  please<br />educate yourself on how to avoid buying a puppy that has came from these horrible places.
of all of the things we've bought for our baby, this is the item i appreciate the most.  this fantastic chair is super lightweight and portable.  when our daughter was only a month old, we'd put the chair in the kitchen so she could be with us while we cooked and ate.  we move it all over the house.  she is now 5 months old and she still loves the chair -- and the toys that come with it and easily attach/detach.  this is the best $$$ i have ever spent on anything in my life.
We registered for this gift after reading the reviews... one of the best selling points is the fact that the warmer automatically shuts off. I'd hate to leave it on, and have it catch fire or burn!! It warms quickly, and you can easily adjust milk temperature by adding a little water, or using a little less. Once you determine the best temp. for you, use that amount of water every time. And it BEEPS when it's ready-- another great feature. Very inexpensive also-- we love it!
this mattress makes such a difference in the continued usability of the pac n play.  at 23 pounds, my granddaughter no longer seemed comfortable sleeping on the original thin \\mattress\\ that comes with the playard even though i had put a quilted pad on it.  this mattress fits perfectly, tightly enough to not invite little fingers but easy enough to take in and out to change the sheet or if you want to use the pac n play as a playpen.  a good price for a really good product.
we got this about 6 months ago after talking with friends who use the wubbanub.  my toddler loves the Nuk pacifiers.  She would lose her pacifier during the night and it would fall on the floor and of course she would be mad.  as she got older and could control things more on her own, we thought this would be a great idea.  we call him &#34;Paci Bear&#34;.  He stays in my little ones crib.  If she loses her paci in the night, paci bear saves her, and us from getting woken up.
we have twins and this is a great product.  you can set the sensitivity of the device to turn on when the baby makes enough noise in a set period of time.  as a result, you dont wake up for the small normal baby sleeping noises, but you do when they need your attention.  i found it plenty loud and sensitive.  furthermore, because it only broadcasts when the baby makes noises, the battery can last for days without recharge. buying another for my brother and his wife right now!
our one-year-old is an... enthusiastic eater, and these bibs have held up for about six months of daily use through all sorts of things - they catch food well and wash up easily, both by hand and in the washing machine. one thing of note - as she has gotten older, she has realized that her bib pocket sometimes contains delicious things, and so will pull the bib to get in to the pocket and it will no longer cover her fully. if it were somewhat wider, this wouldn't be an issue.
We were constantly replacing lost pacifiers. We have never lost a Wubbanub! These are especially nice  because the little bit of added weight from the animal helps keep the pacifier from popping out of the baby's mouth so easily. We have had many of the different animal thru several different grand kids. We always just tossed them in a lingerie bag into the washer when they needed cleaning. Theses are always a hit at baby showers and my definite go to when buying a baby gifts!
My baby loves these! We tried several different pacifiers (Nuk, hospital freebie, and the one with the stuffed animal attached) when my daughter was born and she didn't take to any of them. I figured she was just one of those babies that don't like pacis and I was fine with that.  However, one of these came free with my Chicco carseat purchase. I thought nothing of it but offered it to her and she loved it.  She's 5 months old and has been using these since newborn. Love them.
We love WubbaNub!<br /><br />1.  It's really hard to lose.<br />2.  It's more difficult for baby to knock out of his mouth on accident.  It may take some maneuvering to find the right position, but it's certainly better than all our other Soothie pacifiers.<br />3.  It's a Soothie.  Love these!<br />4.  How stinkin' cute is the little duck?  Our little one is just about 3 months and he's finally starting to notice WubbaNub.  We'll see if he becomes attached to it.  Who knows???
we bought the most expensive (non-tv) baby monitor at our local \\r us\\ store.  it cracked and popped constantly - drove my husband nuts.  we decided that the price was worth it and bought the phillips.  we love this monitor and cannot recommend it highly enough.  we love the \\walkie-talkie\\ feature so that if my husband can't find something in the nusery - i can respond without having to get up and go find it for him.  nothing at \\r us\\ even compares - we are very happy!!
I love this calendar. It's beautiful, gender neutral, and a great keepsake. It's so easy to jot things down quickly so I can remember my baby's milestones, firsts, likes, dislikes, schedule, etc. it's much easier to record than an actual baby book. I have the matching book which is beautiful but I haven't touched it. This on the other hand is in use often. I'm glad I have it as this time is going so fast I would most definitely forget some of these memories if I didn't have it.
We received these as a baby shower gift, a novelty really, but we used them for our son when he was about a month old and he loved them. The ridging/bumps along the gum line were an instant soother and he's refused every single other kind of binky since.<br /><br />I've since ordered tons of these to fill his crib and have extras throughout the house.<br /><br />We don't leave home without them and wouldn't dream of running out. We are now loyal Baby Fanatic pacifier customers.
this booster seat is fantastic.  we are care providers for our grandchild 3 full days a week.  this seat negates the need for any highchair.  attaches very securely to a kitchen chair and can easily be removed when not needed.  the entire seat and tray are easy to clean and she can be securely positioned in the chair.  the removable entertainment tray is a great idea, keeping her busy while we prepare her meals.  having adjustable seat heights makes it useful for several years.
this product does what it is purposed for.    we have been using it for about 8 months now and haven't had any problems with it.  we can easily see what's going on from a couple of rooms away and in some instances from over 90 feet.  the battery life isn't the best, so we have to charge it everyday--that's not a big deal.  also, the microphone picks up sound amazing well.  the camera rotates, is extremely easy to mount to a wall and has a 1 click zoom feature that works nicely.
we have bough three types of these cabinet locks.  these simply work the best, are the easiest to install.  you can &#34;overbend them&#34;, if you &#34;groove&#34; your cabinet from wear, and they seem to stay working for another couple weeks.  i'm keeping a few extra on hand, to replace the older ones you get from home depot/lowes, that are just more cheaply made.  these are larger, and stronger, and the adhesive just works.  seems to come off easily as well, with a hairdryer.
Love wubbanubs!! Best pacifier for newborn babies as the animal holds the pacifier close to their mouth even when it pops out. Often my 6 week old can put it back in his own mouth when it pops out or I can grab it quickly since it stays against his chest. We have tried other pacifiers but he won't take any of them except this kind. So now we own five of them.  To clean them I just throw them in the washing machine with the baby clothes and they come out in good shape every time.
i had graco products with my first child, and looking around there weren't very many patterns/colors that i liked other than this one. i purchased this item and love it. i was a little worried as i  purchased one of the \\open box\\ items that said it had minor cosmetic damage. i got it in the mail and the box is the only thing that was damaged! i would definitely recommend if you don't want to spend the full price, to buy the \\open box\\ items with minor damage. it is worth it!
Great item to have for new born. He loves this item over other new born pacifiers. He is 10 days old. And no worries he nurses as well. At the hospital they don't suggest new borns to use pacifiers, reason: may confuse them taking nipples. I have no problem, and he calms down very easily while I am changing him or putting him to sleep. I highly recommend it.<br />It doesn't have hole to put pacifier clip on, we made a little hole to attach it. No problem. Totally worth the money.
I tried a couple of other pacifiers (Nuk and playtex) and baby girl liked them just fine. I pulled the free Phillips pacifier from the hospital out because she was gumming my fingers after eating. She LOVED it and I immediately ordered two more. She alternates between sucking and gumming and I don't know which she enjoys more. Super easy to clean and doesn't get water trapped inside like some pacifiers. My ONLY complaint is that I don't know of an easy way to use a pacifier clip.
Switched to these pacis after using the other Nuk made out of the hard plastic on the outside. Our daughter doesn't get those marks on her cheeks now because of how nice and flexible these are. Also, this doesn't have that big ring on the outside, so it's harder for her to accidentally pull it out and saves her that frustration. And, because it's basically all one piece, there aren't those nooks and crannies for fuzz and stuff to get caught, which makes cleaning them much easier.
I bought this pacifier cast is a good size and fits 2 Soothies in it!  The hook is perfect to hook onto the outside of your diaper bag.  The case has holes in it to prevent moisture from building up inside if the pacifiers were wet.  The case is BPA free which is another plus.  Looks like it comes in orange and blue, but you can't choose your own color when you order it, you get what they give you.  I received the orange and it's perfect since it stands out on my dark diaper bag.
these are hands down my favorite swaddle blankets out there. they are slightly thinner than my aden+anais blankets, but they have a little more give and are easily 10x softer. after a wash or two, they become buttery soft. we won't buy any other brand. the size is perfect, too. i won't waste my money on smaller blankets anymore.<br /><br />i can get a great tight swaddle with these, and they make the perfect lightweight nursing cover. my oldest now uses his as a security blankie.
I just HAD to purchase this to go along with an  upcoming baby shower gift after watching another friend's 1 month old cuddle this sweet little monkey in his fists while sleeping away with the pacifier in his mouth. Seriously one of the sweetest sights!.  Perfect for not having pacifiers spit out and dropped in unsanitary places. Small enough for the littlest of babies but enough  to grow with. I will definitely be buying an assortment of these when my day comes to be a mother. :)
I love this and at first I thought it would be too big for my newborn, but because of how it's made its actually easy for her to keep it in her mouth because the elephant lays on her chest. Downside is the pacified can't be removed from the elephant since its sewn on. So cleaning it can only be by hand so you would have to be extra careful it doesn't get dirty, since t can't go in he laundry machine. But it's cute. A great size and my newborn has no issues sucking on the pacifier.
has held up great through the wash. i was concerned with the ties as others had complained but it came with 5 ties that are well spaced out. they are very sturdy and keep the pad in place. unfortunately my daughter had already gotten so many teeth marks in her crib so i really wish we had bought this sooner! it has actually made her stop chewing on it all together as she doesn't like the fleece in her mouth. very pleased with this product and would recommend to anyone with a baby.
These are great, same quality as the NUK binkies we've been using since she was a few weeks old.  Finally time to throw away the old ones, that are suitable for 6 months and younger.  The NUKS hold up well and she loves them. She'll spit out a Soothie or Avent and look for the NUK.  The only drawback is that hair can get caught between the plastic and silicon, but I just run my fingernail around it when cleaning to get the hair out.  My kid loves these.  That's good enough for us.
i was looking for a bib that would cover more of my grandson's shirts and after looking at all the brick and mortar stores i finally looked here and found these.  the reviews from others help make my decision and i am glad i purchased these.  was a little afraid about spending so much on after all bibs but after using them now for a few months i am glad.  they have with held the washing machine and are easy wiped down and made of softer material so it doesn't bunch up and crinkle.
i have a medela manual pump that i got from the hospital, it hurts! i was then turned off from pumping however with my second baby, i decided to try an electric pump and i am so glad i did! i read many many reviews and decided to pay a bit extra for this pump because of all the positive reviews. the instructions are easy to follow and it is not noisy. i pumped with my two babies fast asleep next to me. i am relieved to have found this pump so now hubby and i can have a life again!
We probably have a dozen of these around the house and cars. They are really reasonably priced on here, and it's comforting to know that when my daughter has lost 5 of these in her crib through the night, I have another few ready on her nightstand!<br />We have this kind and the 3+ month version, our 9-month-old daughter has been using them interchangeably for sucking and gnawing with her new teeth. These are slightly more flexible, but they're holding up great, no casualties yet.
I first bought my son the brown dog Wubbanub, which he really liked, so I bought him this Dino and the lion. Not only is this Dino wicked cute, my 6 month old has shown a preference to this one over the other two. Yeah I wish there was a way to change out the pacifier part (because it's sewn in just like every other Wubbanub out there) but its very easy to clean, I just toss it in with the clothes every time I do a load of my sons laundry. This was worth every penny I spent on it!
We never lose this binkie! Ours doesnt look like this anymore because my daughter loves it. She has to have it every night to go to sleep. You would think this would get gross. It does. It got really gross and I kept washing it with a cloth until I got sick of it. Then we threw it in with her bedding. It got washed and dried on medium heat. It was nice and clean and had no issues! It is not recommended but believe me, it needs to be really washed after awhile. We have the elephant.
I originally got some of these pacifiers when my son was first born and he would take them just as well as the hospital pacifiers.  The pacifiers from the hospital are softer but he did not seem to care.  As soon as he started trying to teethe(around 5 months) these were even better because they were thicker than the ones from the hospital.  He loves these pacifiers and chews on them all he wants when he is teething and they hold up great.  I would highly recommend these to anyone.
one of the best items we have as new parents.  we did not want to have to run an almost empty dishwasher every day to sanitize bottles, nipples, etc.  with this, you fill the bottom with any type of bottle, throw nipples in the top (you can literally throw them in there).  you fill the bottom ring with distilled water, plug it in and press the button on the bottom.  it runs for about 10 minutes at a very high temperature (lots of steam).  turns off automatically.  nice and sterile.
we love using our aquatopia delux safety bath thermometer alarm. it's set up so it only turns on when it hits water, so it doesn't overdrain the batteries, and it lets you know if the water has gotten too cold or too hot. the recommended range is 90-100 degrees f, and i never realised before that what i would probably shower in is actually higher than 100, so it's good to have the alarm for peace of mind. i would definitely recommend this. it's cute and has worked very well for us.
this worked out so well for what i wanted it it for! i loved the fact that i did not have to install hardware to the banister and i like that it was easy to open for all members of my family. i needed it to keep my medium sized dogs on the first floor and it has done the job! i had looked at stores and the prize was unbeatable for the quality of gate. it's iron so my dog could not chew thrown it like the other  wooded stuff around. i'm very happy and satisfied with this product. :-)
Got this when my son was 6 weeks and he was able to hold on to it bc he likes to hold onto something while he sleeps. I was really getting aggravated when he would wake up wanting his paci and it would be dark so i couldn't find it and it was constantly falling out of his mouth. with this if i swaddle him he can't push it away from his mouth. and he was already sucking soothies so whoever came up with this idea is genius. And i love that you can just stick it in the washing machine.
i absolutely love this crib! it's beautiful, sturdy and the perfect size for our room. it was super easy for my hubby to put together ( me being 7 months pregnant) i watched for moral support and praise :-). my little bundle isn't here yet but it looks beautiful and seems like it will do a great job of keeping our sweet pea comfy. i've now ordered the dream on me dresser changing table and can't wait to see it when it gets here ( also in cherry) the set should look amazing together.
I know that that's not what they're supposed to be used for but hey! It worked for me. These are much less expensive and you get so many more than acutaly Breast Pump Wipes. Also, I feel like these are a better size for a breast pump wipe. That's what I used them for since I pumped about 3 times a day. I would use a wipe after each use and then at the end of the day I would wash all the parts. WITHOUT breaking the bank. Those other wipes are very expensive and you don't get as many.
have taken it to the mainland from hawaii and back so far.  it was awesome.  kept our marathon seat in perfect condition and we stuffed it full of blankets and diapers.  no ripping problems.  it seems very sturdy and now we are using it to store our infant car seat for the next baby.  very satisfied with this purchase.  i originally bought another bag only to find out it didn't have wheels.  i returned it and got this one immediately and i'm so glad i did, even though it costs more.
We have 3 Wubbanubs and by far this one is my favorite because it is wide and flat so it stays in place better.  Since my little one has issues with sucking, I swaddle him tight and put the Wubbanub under the blanket. If he turns his head, he can turn back and find it again. With our other wubbanubs, they wobble and don't stay in place as well. When he is awake, he does like the dinosaur best because it is thin and easier for him to hold but this one does the trick for sleepy times.
These pacifiers are gorgeous! I know that sounds silly but they really are. They are sparkly which is fantastic for anyones little princess. I thought these were really cute in the picture but they are even better in person. These are by far my favorite pacifiers just for the pictures on them alone. All of the pacifiers we have in our house for our kiddos are Mam. We have tried many other pacifiers and none compare as far as quality, cuteness and the fact that my kids preferred them.
I bought these for a lillebaby complete carrier. I do wish they had a snap to keep them on, because they have a tendency to fall off unless I remember to buckle the bottom when not in use. But I'm giving it a five because they work great to put my long legged two year old into a proper &#34;w&#34; position. I feel less strain when she's in this position as well. I feel that at $13 the annoyance of them slipping off is definately worth it. The other option is a $200 toddler carrier...
These pacis are great, my daughter was originally hooked on the Avent classic ones but I hated that they had different parts to them that trapped water. I much preferred the all in one design of the soothies or gumdrop pacis, much easier to clean as they are all one piece but my daughter HATED their nipple. These are like the combined best of each, the nipple is a classic style but you get the all in one silicone design of the gumdrop!! They are also so cute. You won't regret these:)
i hate to admit it, but i have a baby fetish. i like to suck on a pacifier, etc. pretty harmless. tis pacifier is well made. i think it could be a lot better - thesurrounding plastic part is horizontal, to the face and lips. i think if it were curved, to fit the shape of the lips, it would be much better. there are many nerve endings o the lips and face. if the pacifier were curved, it would simulate the face and lips more.  i look forward to $5,000 for product design.. john/honolulu
This item was recommended to me by a friend. I thought it was very silly, now I don't know if we could live without it! I am ordering another one just in case this one gets lost. It helps keep the binky in my daughters mouth, but also she likes to stroke the arms and legs and seems to find it comforting. It also makes it much easier to find in the diaper bag without taking everything out of the bag in a mad search for a binky. I will buy one for every baby shower I go to from now on.
i have found this nasal aspirator better than even the hosptial blue one.  i have found the suction is excellent.  i have used it for the past 5.5 years with my 3 children.  the two-piece aspirators don't give enough suction.  this one squeezes well.  i haven't found thickness in mine a problem; it is actually softer than the hospital version, and that's why i feel it's better.  the bonus is the cute-factor, which all my children love.  they are tempted, though, to chew on the trunk!
Have purchased 10+ of these b/c it's the only pacifier my little guy likes. The only down side is that the nipple and base are two separate parts, smag and nasty food particles get trapped in between and cleaning effort are futile to removing any of it; hence the purchase of so many. I suppose these things should be replaced periodically any way, so not gonna stop us from buying them. BE WARNED: your little man will get gads of attention where ever you go, great reactions from people.
I can't say this pacifier will work for every baby but it worked perfectly for our 8 week old. We tried the very popular green soothie starting week 3, and she just didn't like it. She'd push out of her mouth and if she did accept it, it usually fell out immediately. This pacifier is softer and flatter, which resembles a nipple more. The cover is also a bit curved, helping it stay in her mouth a bit longer. She really likes it and it's made nap time much easier, I highly recommend it!
this blanket is sooo soft and washes up like a dream. our son loves it so we take it everywhere. it keeps him warm but i would recommend only using it to cover up not to swaddle with. the side you see in the picture has the softer fabric but on the other side is a slippery fabric like satin, which would make it hard to hold/swaddle a baby. the color is great and only slightly darker than in the picture. it's perfect for anyone doing a winnie the pooh theme or just likes the character.
nuby actually sent me this teether to review, but i've purchased several of their teethers before then, so i'm very familiar with this brand. we have the blue sea horse teether, and it's really cute and colorful! the ring and the shape of the actual teether itself is easy for small hands to grab, and the multiple teething areas are good for cutting different teeth. my son's favorite part is actually the little fabric ties at the top. for some reason, he really likes chewing on fabric.
we just bought this pillow for my 2.5 year old as she transitioned to her big girl bed!  she was super excited about this but the big people pillows were just not cutting it!  they were way too tall and firm for her little neck.  i searched and found this great option and we were not disappointed!  the pillow is fluffy, but not too firm.  she loves to rest her head on it and it makes her feel even more like a big girl!  couldn't be happier with it and would buy it again in a heartbeat!
use these on all of our interior doors when we have our windows open.  otherwise they all end up slamming shut due to the varying air pressure (we have a lot of windows, 11 on the main floor alone).  these are nice and small, and do the job well.<br /><br />they also come in handy when the young grand kids come over, the doors can't shut on tiny little fingers.  they fit anywhere along the door edge, up and out of reach if need be.<br /><br />love em, mine serve double duty, very well!
Can't live with out this product!!! Since day 1 til now (7months) she has used & enjoyed all these products.  I also breast fed w/o any issues of confusion. Perfect for little hands & mouths. They are the easiest to clean. She gums almost every part of the wubby.  Also my dtr is so fickle that she refuses other pacifiers & will scream until I give her a Wubbanub. (I have tried other pacifiers ie dr browns, tommee tippee, etc but without luck.)  Can't say enough good about this product.
this has been one of the best baby product purchases we have made so far.  we have hard wood floors and needed a soft surface for our baby to crawl, roll and walk on.  this is perfect! it is very big and covers a large play area.  the mat is brightly colored and the playful pictures keep our baby engaged.  he had multiple falls on this mat as he learned to walk and he would get up unaffected. the mat is not super thick, but it is very dense and will protect them from bumps and bruises.
this ladybug has been a major solution for us!!!  my daughter would not stay in her toddler bed at all until we got her this.  bedtime was a big struggle for us until she got her ladybug.  now she goes to bed with virtually no complaints, and stays in her toddler bed!  i also love that the light is dim to begin with, and then goes out after 45 minutes so she can sleep in total darkness for the rest of the night (better for health and development).  i would highly recommend this product!
the rock'n play sleeper is the best baby sleeper ever! when my grandson was born, a new-mommy friend suggested this item to keep at my house and i am so glad i did.  when my grandson came to visit, he slept soundly in it and, because of the slight elevation, he was able to breathe better.  the sleeper went home with him!  whenever my daughter needs to keep him nearby, the sleeper is lightweight but very sturdy and folds conveniently for travel.  i would recommend this for every newborn.
halo sleep sacks are the best for swaddling infants. i have tried several other brands, but my sons have always been able to break free from them. yes, the velcro is loud, but if the velcro wasn't strong enough the baby would break out in seconds and then it would be pointless. i really like the material of this particular sleep sack, it's nice and light (but not too light) and perfect for semi-chilly spring and fall nights. also the pattern is really appealing. five stars for this one.
As soon as my 5 month old daughter sat down with her PullyPal, she immediately knew to reach and grab for her passy. This actually taught her how to put her passy in her mouth. This not only allows her to choose which passy she wants, but also keeps them clean. Thank you for creating PullyPalz and teaching my daughter to retrieve her own passy. This is an excellent developmental teaching tool for all babies! #verydurable #cutetolookat #finemotordevelopment #handeyecoordination #amusthave
best thing to happen to my sleep haha i am a very light sleeper and almost every noise will wake me up... which is very frustrating. after getting this and having it run all night, i find that i am calmer and fall asleep faster and stay asleep because it drowns out all other noises. i know this is for a baby, but it definitely works for me (an adult)! it has other sounds it can emit too but i just use it for the white noise. would definitely recommend this to anyone needed help sleeping.
i ordered this because i was becoming nervous about using my iphone for white noise and other calming sounds for my newborn. i know there isn't much research to support that electronic devices (cellular devices) cause cancer, but for me it was worth the money in exchange for peace of mind. this machine has a great battery life. we take it everywhere and play it often and still haven't needed to replace the batteries. it goes in the stroller with us and in the car at least 3 times a week.
what other stroller can you push with one hand and still be able to control? none that i am aware of. my family owns a single bob revolution so when i found out i was expecting twins i knew this was the stroller for me. i cant wait until summer comes and we can hit the outdoors. love the ride, the new canopies, and the ease of use. granted it is a little larger, but i have a ford edge and with this sitting on its side it takes up no more space than any other double stroller i have owned.
huge bag! it can fit several large beach towels and the pockets are gigantic. i bought this as a diaper bag but it is a little large for that purpose, nonetheless, it is my go to family bag where i can stick my purse or the diaper bag in it and some towels or snacks and water bottles. it stands up on its own which is a plus! the fabric is durable and the side mesh pockets are super. there is a zipper on top. i would recommend this bag to anyone needing a family bag for all the essentials.
This is very useful in the car seat when the baby is too small to hold in the paci.  It will help keep the paci in the mouth.  She can hold it easy too!  Now that she is 8 motnhs old, we put it in her crib with her and if she wakes up she can find it herself and put it in her mouth.  Again, I can not say how great this was for the car seat!  It washes easy in the washing machine.  I buy these for every baby shower I go to.  They are cute, cuddly, and work great!!!!  We love this product!!
we travel with our toddler quite a bit and this is an excellent, easy to carry, cot for any sleeping arrangement! so much easier than taking a crib mattress! make sure that your toddler can get up and down from things, i had her sleeping in this at about 2-years old. i think before that age they are still unsteady and may fall out of the cot. it is low to the ground and with a bottom blanket for extra padding is a life saver in hotels, grandma's house, and when you have guests. great buy!
this booster seat is perfect! it's lightweight but sturdy and straps to the chair easily  and doesn't slide at all! my daughter was so excited she ended up coloring in it for an hour and didn't want to come out! i slipped the tray behind it to keep it out of the way. it's also super easy to travel with, which is why we got it in the first place. small enough to pop in the car to go to grandma's or a restaurant and not use those icky wooden ones. so simple, yet so versatile and easy to use!
i bought this to carry around frozen breastmilk and bottles for my son. it was perfect! not too big not to small. a lot of people are confused about the size it's l9\\xw6\\xd4.5<br />it's made of heavy fabric and nothing is broken for me. it has a heavy lining inside for bags to stay frozen when traveling. i went on a plane with frozen breastmilk this this bag from freezer to freezer it was about 5 hours and my milk stayed frozen! very happy with this purchase would recommend it to others!
We got turned onto the Wubbanub later than I'd have liked, went the first few months dropping pacifiers all over the place.  This is adorable and helps baby hold onto it.  He's 7 months now and still loving it, even once he has teeth I think we'll keep using it and just keep an eye on it to make sure he doesn't chew through it (it's the softer soothie made for younger babies).  We prefer the elephant to the giraffe, it's just a bit cuter and I actually think it balances better on his chest.
I tried several different brands of pacifiers (MAM, Avent, Nuk, and the hospital one) but my baby would either gag or spit them right out. Finally I tried these, since I am a fan of Dr. Browns bottles, and she took it right away and has been using it ever since.     These pacifiers have what's called an orthodontic nipple (more flat at the tip) which is supposed to be closer to what babies experience breastfeeding. Also, these are made in the USA so I felt more comfortable with the quality.
This product was a lifesaver for my preemie triplets. We could not have survived the first 4 months of life without them. Two out of three have migrated to a different paci now at almost 11 months, but one still loves her WubbaNub. We have a ton of different animals (monkey, red dog, brown dog, giraffe, 2 chicks/ducks, 2 frogs) all work well are are great. Even the two that use different pacis now, still sleep with theirs and occasionally will wake up with it in their mouths. Great product!
this is a great deal on a time-saving product for babies who love to be swaddled!  we just discovered the swaddleme blanket for our 10 week old and only wish we had found it sooner.  the blanket allows you to tightly and easily swaddle the baby's arms with a soft velcro closure and let baby's legs be looser and comfortable.  we got three of these for $15.99 which is a steal considering we paid $12.99 for just one of these blankets last week at babies r us.  this is a must have for infants!!
these are great because they hold a substantial amount of juice for baby, are easy to disasymble for easy cleaning, and have replaceable parts for sale (the leak-proof attachment). i have tried about 15 different kinds of sippy cups for my twin 23 mo olds and these seem to be the only ones that barely leak. i've learned that if a true &#34;leak proof&#34; cup exists, it's not sold in tx or online because i've purchased them all!  these come extremely close to being totally leak-proof though.
i agree with every other positive review...my husband spent a lot of time trying to jerry-rig a different baby gate (one with holes in it) with clear plastic and zip ties, which worked, but then we moved a few months later (we're military) and the baby gate he spent so much time on didn't fit in our new place...save yourself some time and just get this one...one of my ferrets can usually figure out how to get around anything (anything!...sigh), but this gate is impervious to his ingenuity :)
i got this at walmart last night for 34$ regular price! it is fully expanded and is about 5 inches thick when it fully expands. be sure to take of cover so the mattress can expand naturally. originally i didn't want to buy it because i thought it would be too soft, which is not ideal for crib mattresses. but i decided to give it a try and return it if i didn't like it. its not too soft by any means, but not rock hard either. i honestly think its perfect! i love the quality. would buy again!!
i have gotten baskets like this over the course of the past few years by kee-ka for all of my friends and family. they are perfection! these products are completely organic. all parents and infants i know who i have given these baskets to have loved them. the pieces are comfortable and cozy on a small infant or child. the pieces are durable and hold up nicely after washing. the baskets are the perfect gift!!!! i strongly recommend these baskets for any and all of your friends with a newborn.
They stay in his mouth and don't fall out and he took to these immediately after trying several others including Dr. Browns pacifiers and the one the hospital gave us and the soothie pacifiers (they popped out of his mouth even with a stuffed animal attached).  He is 5 months old.  They also come with a sanitizing box which you can microwave them in 3 minutes which I find easier than boiling.  MAM also sells a pacifier clip but it does not fit tightly enough for use on these small pacifiers.
i work in an nicu and this is our favorite swing. it is given to our fussiest babies. the different options including some pretty fast motions and mimic a person. i feel it is does work like a person as these swings and being held by a person are what works best for the fussiest babies compared to more traditional swings. as an rn (like a mom) i can't carry the babies 24/7 so this swing works wonders. plus you can operate it with your feet if you have your hands full so that is helpful. haha.
This is the only pacifier that my daughter would use.. She started teething at 2 months and she was just in hell. I felt so helpless and tried at least a dozen pacifiers until she liked the Wubbanub. It's perfect; the plush toy gives her something to play with.  The natural nipple was a plus easy for her to latch on to. My little one takes it out of her mouth to curls up with it in her crib and go to sleep. Instead of the others that she threw on the ground with a look of disdain on her face.
purchased for a shower gift since it was on their registry.  it is high quality materials and large enough pieces that you don't need to worry about the parts being too small and a choking hazard.  the expectant mom was very pleased with the teething necklace and they make great gifts.  the necklace itself was nicely made and  you can see the necklace isn't intended to be worn as jewelry for the mom, but it's also nice enough that you aren't feel awkward wearing it while the baby chews on it.
Our daughter is six months old and LOVES her Wubby.  She can get it in and out of her mouth easily in the car or at home, which is great.  If she sees it somewhere, she will focus on it until she gets it. She absolutely loves this thing. We bought two more (another elephant and a caterpillar). The elephant is my favorite because it's body is bigger and easier for her to grab. Basically, if we were stuck on a desert island and only allowed one baby item, this would be it. No question about it.
we had the previous generation of this monitor with the recharging bases. those units functioned for 3 years, but the batteries would not hold a charge after a few months on the base units (we went through several replacement batteries before giving up on the units). the new design gets rid of the recharging bases, which has so far (1+ year) resulted in improved battery life and monitor functionality. very happy we decided to go back to the graco as it has good range with basic functionality.
i adore my baby k'tan. it was a learning experience putting it on and using it the first few times. after i got use to it it became a lifesaver. it's super fast and easy to use, my baby (now a young toddler) loves being in it. the different positions really allow it to grow with baby. i really got good at being able to nurse in it (completely discreetly!) while shopping. this is actually the second one i've ordered (for a friend!) my husband says he wants one in his size if we have more kids!
I had to get this pacifier online because the other one that my baby had he lost it and couldnt stop crying.. He wanted his pacifier and the other ones that he had he didnt want it.. They were too small. So I got it and he still loves it... Even though he is growing and doesnt use it a lot like before... It will be easier for me to take it off..I reccomend this pacifier just try not to lose it... I went to the store and bought it but they didnt have it.. so thats why i had to order it online..
i got ronoronos at a half-off deal four months ago, when my baby was four months old.  it was a hit from day one.  he loves the ring the best, especially now that he's teething, but i have noticed that he also likes to chew a little on the softer legs too.  one leg has a squeaker in the heel,another leg is a rattle, and another leg is just plain.  the tail pulls for the vibration feature, which always makes my son smile.<br /><br />this is a pricey toy and not machine-washable, but we love it.
I have tried several pacifiers and these by far are the best of the lot (at least, they're the only ones my baby want). My son practically grew up to toddlerhood with these. It got him through his circumcision, his regular bouts of croup, his vaccine ordeals and his frightening visits to the pediatrician's clinic. When nothing else works, these rubber lifesavers are the only answer to his explosive tantrums. Without these, I would lose my sanity while treading the torturous path of parenthood.
we still have 2 1/2 months before our little guy arrives, but right now, the crib seems really great. my husband and i put this together very easily. the instructions were clear. all the parts were there. when we finished, the crib felt extremely sturdy and durable. the color is a deep espresso brown and absolutely gorgeous. couldn't be happier. feels like it's an extremely expensive crib, but the price we paid was excellent! so far, i'd take this over any over-priced crib any day of the week.
i've tried several cloth training pants (after using cloth diapers) and these are hands down my favorite.  they are super comfortable for my toddler and not very bulky but still catch her accidents.  even when she has a big accident it mostly contains so i only have to clean her and (possibly) her clothes, not the floor or whatever was underneath her.  i love the designs they come in too.  i think their fit is very accurate and wish more parents would use re-usable products with their children.
I ordered these pacifiers for my grandson because they were like the older style I had used with my kids.  They were shown in blue, and said colors may vary, and I knew without a doubt, we would end up getting the pink ones.  We have a boy and wanted any other color except the pink.  He does like these pacifier's better than his other ones, but my daughter won't use them when we take him out anywhere in public. He's only 2 months old and you can't really tell if he is a boy or girl at this age.
Exactly the same as what my newborn was given at the nicu and at the children's hospital. When I brought the baby home my dog found the pacifiers on the coffe table and decided that they were dog chew toys so I ordered these to replace them.<br /><br />My only dumb move was that I didn't double check the scent. My daughter was using the vanilla scented ones in the nicu and these were unscented. She still loves them but I will order the vanilla scented ones next time(and hide them from the dog.)
not going to lie it took a few minutes for our 1 month old  baby to figure out how to use this nipple but once he did he had no problem downing the milk pretty quick. at  the moment we are only feeding him one bottle a day so he can get used to it for when i go back to work. i was nervous because of all the negative reviews but this is working great for us so far. as i said before though it will take some time for the baby to get used to it the first time you try it so don't give up right away!
this is a surprisingly useful little bag.  it attaches to stroller or larger bags.  it keeps my diapers organized and where i can find them as opposed to being jammed here or there.  it's a very good size, not so large as to be bulky, not so small as to not hold enough.  i can fit in around 10 diapers (size six and four), a pack of wipes, and a toss-away changing liner at the max which covers almost any length trip.  the zipper works well after six months of solid use.    i recommend this item.
My baby was in love with her Wubbanubs from first sight.  The only &#34;problem&#34; is that it's been hard to try and transition her to other pacifiers now that she's older- I wish the animal was detachable and could be switched out to other styles of pacifiers.  It does lose its plumpness after a few months but nothing has become unstitched.  They say to switch out after a few months but the pacifier shows no wear and tear, and can be cleaned, so there hasn't been a need to buy a replacement.
I don't know how my first son made it through without these! My second son is now 8 months old and still loves his Wubbanub. It's easier for them when they're little to find and to keep in their mouth as the stuffed animal part will just sit on their chest so if they open their mouth for minute it doesn't just roll away. And with him at daycare this also acts as his &#34;lovey&#34; from home and helps him to self sooth. The only problem at daycare is that all of the other babies want one too. :)
i got these for my son's room.  we have no texture on the walls but they are painted with satin finish paint.  they stick fine, and as we have moved furniture around, i was able to reposition them on the walls.  i am now using them in my other son's bedroom as well.  one room is painted a light lime/mint green, and the other is a light blue (but darker than baby blue), and they look good in both rooms.  i like that as they get older, we can just peel them off the walls and don't have to repaint.
This is not only a pacifier but a wonderful first toy for an infant. My baby loves this toy and is ahead of the game with her hand coordination because of it. She is always playing with it and enjoys putting it in and out of her mouth, improving not only her coordination but her focus as well. She could successfully put this in her mouth from her chest at just over 2 months. No other binkie will do, she has no interest in them, we have 3 and she loves them all. Easy for mom to find in a jam too!
Our baby loves this!  She had it since she was about 6 months old and it's only for naptime and bedtimes.  They are super soft and very cute.  She knows it's time for bed when we give her the wubbie.  Best part is that she can find them easily in the crib and self soothe to back to sleep.  It's now part of our go-to gift when any of our friends have a new baby!  I haven't tried washing the whole thing, but will wash the soothie with baby dish soap and water if it gets dropped somewhere untoward.
I don't really know what it is but my little one will only take these pacifiers. I tried pretty much every brand of pacis out there and the only ones she'll take are the ones shaped like the soothies. I love the fact that they are soft so if she rolls over them they won't hurt her.  At first I was worried cuz I thought the round shape covering her nose would be a problem, but now I see it doesn't block her nose at all and she seems very comfortable sucking on them.  I think these are just great.
Fits perfectly onto the Ikea Malm dresser which is slightly too narrow for most changing pads. The downside is that baby grew too long within a year - but that's not the changing pad's fault!! Now I just change him on the bed, floor or anywhere else that he can't injure himself as the dresser would be too dangerous now that he can move around! I found it difficult to figure out which cover would fit it before purchasing, but this cover fits perfectly: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009ES00DQ/
I see not a very good opinion about this product. It got broken after 1.5 month but still it was my daughter's favourite one. And I getting another one. I feel I cannot expect the plastic not to brake when her binky is 20 times a day drop on the floor. That's how my daughter treated it. In fact it looks to bulky on her face but it is only us, the baby doesn't care. And of course she played with it folding and opening the wings nonstop. It realy saved me from cleaning her pacifier too often a day.
I tried the soothie first since that's the one my baby had at the hospital and I had heard great things about it but my baby didn't like it at all. Then I went to the MAM and he took it the first time! I bought the newborn size at first and whwn he turned 6 weeks I bought the 0-6 months, but I have a big baby, weighed 8 lbs when born. So a smaller newborn would probably need the neqborn size longer. The only thing I didn't like is that there is no handle or anything so its hard to grab sometimes.
some friends of our turned us on to these pail liners, and we purchased 2 of them.  overall, we couldn't be happier.  we have a flip-pop trash can that &#34;snaps&#34; shut, so as to keep the odor contained.  we simply push the bags inside out when we stick them in the wash, and that's it.  we've been using these over a year without any leaking, and we wash/dry them with our diapers.  we dry them on delicate and haven't had any issues.  i'm very pleased with the product and highly recommend them!
this stroller is wonderful. i bought it after seeing the reviews of everyone else. it works so well. my favorite feature of the stroller is that it fits my graco car seat perfectly. as others have mentioned, the car seat does stick over the back a little making it uncomfortable for my other daughter to sit down, but she would rather stand anyway so she can see out. i also like the turn radius on it. corners so easily.  the price on it also makes it completely worth it. i love everything about it.
I highly recommend this product to anyone who is or is planning on using nooks for babies. It easily snaps on and off so I have this one hooked onto the diaper bag and another onto my purse. This allows you to now have to dig through pockets or the bottom of bags to try and find the nook. It's right there and easy to grab, especially when you need to ask and older child to bring one to you. It also keeps the pacifiers clean. It can easily fit 2 or 3 in there at a time. The colors are accurate too.
We received one of these as a gift and our baby fell in love with it. When we misplaced it I was thrilled that I could order a replacement on Amazon Prime! The pacifier is a pretty universal one that can be found at any baby store. It's actually branded Soothie(TM). The lamb is just a plush stuffed toy that has been attached at the mouth to the pacifier. They are permanently attached and the plush usually gets wet when I'm washing the pacifier. It does dry very fast so this is not an issue for us.
These are the perfect size for a newborn and well worth the investment since we've always needed pacifiers most in the beginning.  I love the size and shape of these and so does my baby.  I also like that the pacifier is transparent so you can see more of the baby's face, and that they blend in and aren't so attention grabbing.  The nipple covers are also a really nice touch.  I'm not typically worried about germs, but I also don't want junk to get all over my baby's pacifier.  Highly recommended.
i bought this for my son when he was little, it fits over all shopping carts, and any high chair.  if you are a mom, invest in this, it will save your child from alot of germs, just think what is on those high chairs and grocery carts......yuck!!  i have bought this for everyone i know that is having a baby, and i always get asked where to get one.  note: don't buy the one in the stores that just cover the front and back of the cart, your baby still touches the sides. <br /> <br />katie, tampa, fl
This is my 5th baby and none of the others have taken to a pacifier.  I have had two thumb-suckers, so I always want to avoid that.  Finally I have a baby that will take a pacifier, which for a busy mom is great, especially in the car when I can't get to her.  I will say that she had some nipple confusion in the early days when I used it too much, so I just waited a couple weeks and now she's doing great with them.  Only wish we hadn't lost the pink and purple ones so quickly!  Time to order more!
very nice step stool.  small and short, not as tall as a regular step stool.  made of bamboo, arrived fully assembled.  i bought a bed that is taller than i'm used to, so i got this for a foot stool next to the bed.  perfect for my use. one other thing is that it is fairly narrow as far as width goes. my relatively small size six and a half feet do not fit fully on the stool's width, but i don't need them too. if you need a stool that your foot fits on completely this might not be the one for you.
Our daughter loves this binky, she only gets this binky at nap times or bed time so she looks forward to it, and the best part? Because of the little stuffed animal, she has an easier time keeping the binky in her mouth, and if it falls out she can manage to sometimes place it back into her mouth, and she's only 4 months old! We love it, the only thing not so great is the price, it should be more in the $8.99 range so it doesn't make you feel so ripped off. I'd still buy some in the future though.
i love these things -- have one for each of my two, a 10 month old and a 2.5 year old.  it hides the extra floor food until sweeping time, food unsticks more easily, and it keeps stuff from getting tracked all over and ground in.  also protects the rug under my table, which isn't a huge deal because you a) can't see most of the rug due to splat mat presence and b) it's a cheap rug anyway.  but it looks much better without tons of blueberry, banana and avocado smeared into it.  i really like these.
I was going to buy these but put it off and then today I checked the mail and surprise for me, they were there in the mail.  Turns out my mom saw my amazon wish list and bought them for my son.  I am very pleased.  These pacifiers have such a soft feel to them.  I've been giving my son the NUK binki from the hospital but he wasn't a huge fan of it but I gave him this one earlier today and he's seemed to relax very easily as soon as he takes it.  I am very happy with it.  I recommend this purchase.
i keep two of these bags in my purse for when i'm out with my boys and we buy a snack they need to share. i used to get so frustrated searching the car for an extra cup, or something to divide out their snack with. these bags are great because they don't take up any room. the kids enjoy them too! they are easy to clean -- either wipe out with a damp cloth, or wash (hang dry). and they do well with fruits and dry snacks. we just have one set of \\mini\\ bags and that's been fantastic for our needs.
if you are hand washing breast pump parts, the lawn drying rack is a lifesaver!! a relative has the smaller \\grass\\ drying rack and is constantly running out of apace on the rack. we purchased the larger \\lawn\\ along with a \\tree\\ for hanging smaller parts and couldn't be more pleased! the grass holds everything easily from the smallest parts to the largest. the grass is stiff as another reviewer mentioned, but in my opinion it keeps the parts suspended for better air circulation and drying.
The Nuk Genius Pacifier is amazing!  I had started him out on the paci from the hospital and then switched to the regular Nuk pacifier which was much better.  Then, my mother bought him the Nuk Genius and it's so much better.  It is the only paci to stay in his mouth.  This means, that I don't have to constantly put a fallen out paci back in his mouth when he's fighting sleep.  I love this product and do not have anything negative to say about it.  If you like the Nuk pacifiers, try the Nuk Genius!
i previously had the baby's quiet sounds (summer infant care) monitor but returned it b/c the reception started out ok and then got progressively worse.  as soon as i plugged in this monitor the picture quality was crystal clear and the sound monitor is very sensitive.  if you are going to be far away from the signal then you'll have to plug it into the wall to boost the signal, but it still works very well. <br /> <br />i'm very pleased and would recommend buying one the sooner the better!! <br />
When I was toddler I loved tags and always played with whatever tag I could reach. Now i'm in high school and the stress has rekindled my love of tags. I make a point to wear a shirt with a good tag (the silky kind) on test days or when I have a presentation. This is a great product that I can use when I can't fall asleep or fiddle with to help me focus. The tags are a good size to stick my fingers in and the blanket it soo soft. It's also a good size to bring to sleepovers or throw in my backpack.
Wubbanubs have been wonderful for my little one.  He loves them and his Soothies, so I had no problem with the Soothie being attached.  And even though he's still a little young to fully grasp them, they're big enough for him to hug easily and hold on to them that way.  It's been great not to have to worry about pacis falling on the floor.  This one is one of his favorites, probably because the head is bigger for him to maneuver and it has the soft mane in a different fabric that he can also touch.
bought this because of the great reviews about it and they're all true. i have really sensitive scalp so i'm very prone to dandruff. it's a little hard because i switch from shampoo to shampoo but i've never found the right one until this. it really is gentle and its smell is not anything too grand, just light and simple. i like that because it means there's less irritants in it. i've been using this for almost a week now and it's just great. i don't have dandruff anymore and it never makes me itch.
This is the only pacifier my daughter will take (and we tried seven different kinds!). The nipple on this pacifier seems to be a little shorter/smaller than other pacifiers, which I think is part of the reason she prefers it. It seems very sturdy and is made in the USA, which I really appreciate! If you have tried other pacifiers and your child won't take them, it is worth giving Jollypop a try. Important to note-- I cannot find this in any stores near me, so online ordering may be your only option.
These glow-in-the-dark pacifiers have made our lives SO much easier. A toddler losing her pacifier in the middle of the night has resulted in screaming, crying and more than just her upset at a God-forseen hour. Now she can often find it herself, and when she can't, we are able to sneak in, locate it, pop it back in and sneak out before she fully wakes up and hits the point of no return. Ingenious!! Now if they just had a GPS sensor for when she walks around the house and throws it down somewhere...
The little hole is the perfect size for your finger. My baby loves to suck on this pacifier, and it's been a godsend in getting him back to sleep after midnight breastfeedings when he still wants to suck but is no longer drawing any milk. We brought one home from the hospital, and I'm about to buy a bunch more. Don't pay attention to people who say they are choking hazards; if the pacifier is small enough that the entire thing fits into your child's mouth, it is too small for him. Buy a bigger size!
i love everything about this seat except it's weight. it is a tank so difficult to carry around and put in multiple cars. however, it's ease of installation makes it ideal for various cars so...it's a contradiction. i can tell you though since buying a evenflo sureride for grandmas car and a diono rainier for my husband's that they are all cumbersome and difficult to install so if they are all going to be a pain to carry then you might as well have one that's easy to install and to install properly.
I had a preemie and was terrified of sids. I couldn't use the angel care monitor becuase our daughter was sleeping in a bassinnet in our room. This was the perfect solution. I slept so much better once I had this. Once she got bigger and kicked and rolled more, it would pop off and alarm, but a few false alarms are a small price to pay for peace of mind.  She never seemed to notice it. It doesn't emit or receive radio signals, so you don't need to worry about radiation.   BUY IT - worth every penny.
I bought this right after I started baby sitting my granddaughter at six weeks old. She's 8 months old now, and this has turned out to be the best thing I've gotten her. As it turns out it's a real wrist saver. When I'm holding and feeding her I prop her wubbanub (we call it Wubby)under the bottle and I just barely balance with my hand. She will hold on to a leg or tail and when I take the bottle away she still has Wubby while she's snoozing plus a toy/pacifer when she's awake. Well worth the money.
i use this for occasional work pumping and nights out. i prefer this to my medela double electric and think i get more too! bought it so i could attend a wedding without having to worry about the logistics of being able to pump. the beauty of this is you can do it anywhere, i just threw a blanket over my chest and did it in the car in the parking lot!! if you pump for full time work, you will probably need the double electric, but even so i would get this in addition to for on the to. it does great.
I watch childern in my home. After someone telling me about these when my 3 yr old was born- it had been her best friend since. It is so nice to have for them to be able to hold and find easily when slips out of their mouths. This is the ONLY binki she never lost!!! Was so nice to have on trips, and was such a comfort to our child. When I started watching 2 new borns, I bought one for each of them. One mom loved it so much she bought some for friends of hers that are getting ready to have babies! :)
I love these wubbanub pacifier holders for my twins. We swaddle them when they are sleeping, put the pacifier in their mouths, and plop the wubbanub on their chest so when they spit out the pacifier, it doesn't go far and it's still there if they decide they want to suck on it again. The best part is that they come with Soothie pacifiers, which are perfect for a newborn's small mouth. Once we stopped swaddling them, the fuzzy animal attachment is the perfect size for their little hands to play with.
Our three-month-old absolutely loves his Wubby - it is great that it doesn't fall far when he spits out his paci, AND it's turning into a fun toy now that he's learning how to grasp.  He is so proud of himself when he is able to get it in his mouth by himself, and he loves holding onto the puppy's ears while he's falling asleep.<br /><br />We love that eventually we can cut the paci off and our little one will still have his comfort object; we've bought several of these to keep around just for that!
the product works, my wife and i are happy with it. we took our new born son out in chicago, weather was around 35f to 40f that day, we did not have any problem. we put him in the car seat with the appropriate warm clothing and cover him with a fleece blanket, and push him in around in the stroller with the car seat attached.<br /><br />when we take him out from the car seat, after 20 mins outside the street (not in the car); we can feel that it was very warm inside warm the car seat with this cover.
Absolutely adorable on my little guy. These are his favorite too. The mustache is a great teether material and the nipple is orthodontic and made from food-grade silicone, which is fantastic. So it's a pacifier and teether in one!  Buyers beware though...I've ordered like 10 of these over the last year and had to return several because they were knock offs. The name brand sold by FCTRY are the only ones I keep. They are much better made; thicker plastic base, which seems much safer for my little guy!
These are correct size to use for babies under 6 months. Cute colors, BPA free. Our daughter is happy with these. Review after 1 year: These become our daughters only pacifiers. She is more than a year old, and still using the same size. I had to replace them because they seem to disappear, but love that made of one piece of silicon, and easy to clean. Turned out we never had to go up in size. These are the best. Nice color, we tried all of them, and the green is the one that had been loved the most!
My Daughter is 3 months old (formula fed). We use these as  well as the Medela bottles and she seems to be a little less gassy with these. At first I was concerned about the nipple shape (it is not round, its more like a squished oval), but she likes the MAM pacifiers so we decided to give it a try.<br />She likes them! They are also very easy to clean the bottoms actually screw off as well as the tops and you can sterilize them in the microwave without using a bag or other sterilization contraption.
When you're on the go you'll realize how great these wipes are.  They're food grade and safe.  I used to think you could use baby wipes to wipe down a pacifier or toy, but then you learn that the chemicals in the baby wipes aren't food grade.  That scares me as a new mom.  I'm not super cautious or protective and I'm not a helicopter mom, but when something is going directly into my son's mouth, I think important to at least take this small precaution and buy something that's safe.  Totally worth it.
this is a great product for parents of infants. whereas infants aren't supposed to go to sleep with a blanket in their cribs, they can use this because it is an outfit even though it will give the baby the feel of a blanket. it has sleeves and snaps together. it is very soft and well-made. it seems like it would provide a lot of comfort for the baby, but in a safe way. the print is simple, but classic and pretty. they have a whole line of these in different prints and sizes and i would recommend them.
I got a few of the Gumdrop pacifiers from the hospital when my daughter was born 4 months ago and I love them.  She's not a paci addict like my son was so it helps to have the hole that I can stick my finger in to help her grip it.  We still have a few unused from the hospital but I wanted to buy some in different colors.<br /><br />Note: I tried the Nuk pacifiers too because we received some at our shower but she would not even keep them in her mouth.  I don't think she liked the shape of the nipple.
i've tried lansinoh, johnson & johnson, and playtex pads.  i wear a c cup and have a very heavy milk flow.  lansinohs filled up much too fast, they were much too thin for me.  they were also very uncomfortable when they started filling up and they leaked every time i used them.  the johnson & johnson worked better, but they were itchy and irritated my nipples.  playtex are my absoloute favorite, they held alot of milk and i had much fewer leaks!  they are highly comfortable and i would reccomend them.
perfect addition to our uppababy vista, we get complements on it all the time. holds most water bottles and has that hidden covered compartment in the middle where we carry personal stuff like cellphone and wallet without everyone to see. it also magnetically snaps shut without making noise, an issue with sleeping kids in the stroller. the velcro seems really strong and keeps it in its place on the stroller. we also haven't had to take it off to fold the stroller which is also nice. it was a good buy.
i love how easily the drawers slide, and how much space there is to store the necessary items  one needs for the baby.  it arrived quickly, in good condition, and all the necessary parts were enclosed.  the only frustration was putting it together.  luckily my husband is very good at this sort of thing; however there were almost no instructions on the paper.  construction proved to be time consuming and difficult.  this wasn't the sellers fault.  the product once completed is attractive, and practical.
I love this I bought several different animals for gifts but my son has the monkey this monkey is &#34;his monkey&#34; we don't leave that guy behind ! I was afraid this thing wouldn't hold up but my son will be 1 in a month and his monkey is flawless ! I love this I bought several different animals for gifts but my son has the monkey this monkey is &#34;his monkey&#34; we don't leave that guy behind !

These pacifiers are great, rated well by physicians. They have not caused us any problems with nipple confusion. Our baby has been a sucker soother since day one, so these help us in between feedings and help our baby to fall asleep.  They also have holes in the ring around the pacifier in case a larger child swallows it accidentally, it will not block their airway.  This is a common occurrence in the ER with young children.  Made of good quality and have not worn with heavy daily use and hand washing.
My daughter is now 6 months old and this is her best friend!  She learned fairly quickly how to put this back in her mouth on her own which saved us many a trip up and down the stairs to her room.  She only uses him at night and on occasion when she's trying to sleep while we are out and about.  The giraffe makes grabbing and replacing so much easier for little ones.  Well worth the money.  Easy to clean too as we just put him in a pillow case and run it through a delicate cycle with her other clothes.
My daughter was born prematurely, and this was the first pacifier she was given in the hospital. I've tried others, but these are by far her preferred pacifiers. I like them because they are much easier to thoroughly clean than most others, with no little crevices to harbor dirt or germs. I also feel safer with the one piece design, with peace of mind that these cannot come apart or break. Doubt that would happen with other pacifiers, but being a mom I naturally worry about everything with my daughter.
I love Wabbanub!  Soothie pacifiers are, in my opinion, the best.  The animal holds the pacifier in just the right place.  It also keeps it from falling on the ground all of the time, or rolling away and getting lost.  My little boy has had his for almost a year now.  He sucks it while crawling around and rubs the ears with his fingers when he's getting sleepy.  Now I give one to everyone I know of who is having a baby.  This product is so great, I'm sort-of surprised they aren't more widely available!
We've been using the Garden Fresh Nibbler for our 5 month old and she loves it!  Fresh bananas and frozen peach slices(when her gums are bothering her)are her favorite so far!  I love that the mesh part locks onto the handle part so I don't have to worry about her pulling it apart and getting to the food inside and that it has a lid!  The handle and body of the feeder are made to where she had no problem holding on to it herself.  Easy to clean which is a plus!  I have and will recommend this product!!
My wife bought this one when my daughter was 2 months old. We feed our daughter with bottles (mix formula with breast milk), and since each time we need to take the bottled breast milk from ref (my wife did breast bumping), and mix with formula, we use this warmer all the time. Also, when we travel out, this one is quite useful. Generally with only a little small amount of water, the bottle is warm enough to feed my baby. Also it is quite compact to put in the diaper bag (well, not compact bag though).
We love the NUK brand of bottles and pacifiers and these pacifiers are no exception! These are the only brand my kiddos would take. With how easy these can be to lose, this 4 pack is so worth buying! The colors are exactly as pictured. Would recommend buying the pacifiers and bottles together because baby recognizes the nipple and will take them easier. Love the othodonic shape - its more natural to breastfed babies and I don't have to worry about teeth problems. Would definitely recommend this product!
i bought this play gym for my 3 month old daughter. she loves to kick so much i thought she would enjoy the piano. she fell in love with the mirror and the piano feature. she moves around so much on it that she move out of the view of the mirror and then become frustrated because she can no longer see herself. i would definitely recommend this play gym. it has a lot of features to keep your little one entertained and bright colors to excite them. my daughter also loves to have tummy time on the mat too.
this crib is great quality and i like the dark cherry color. we made sure to order the conversion kits so that we have them for the future. i also found that this glider chair has cherry wood that matches the bed, which was convenient. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/b00l40sgqa/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o06_s01?ie=utf8&psc=1<br /><br />we also purchased this dresser which matches perfectly and is also good quality.<br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/b0069209fy/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00?ie=utf8&psc=1
love how simple the pacifier is and how its wide plate allow us to put it on any surface and it won't tumble easily. also it doesn't easily fall down from baby's mouth if he's lying flat and face facing up since the weight of the pacifier is just nice not too heavy not too lightweight. simple design, easily washed (i boil it in hot water to wash). my baby does not immediately suck the pacifier so we have to hold it between his lips first and then he'll take his time before he properly sucks the soothie.
I bought this for my son and people LOVE it! I am asked all the time where I bought it from cuz they want to get it for their grandchild, niece, nephew...ect I often think Amazon should pay me for the amount of word of mouth I have given on this product... I think if you have a sense of humor and don't see it as some slam against humanity (as some reviewer has) than you'll love it, I think if you do have a problem with it you probably aren't even bothering looking at the product page and or its reviews.
these stickers really work. very strong smell out of packaging but that's what the stickers are for. used this sticker on 3 separate occasion on my son and myself and have not had any mosquito bites. (actually had a mosquito land on my hand after i had the sticker on for at least 20 mins and it just flew off! haha). best aspect is that you can reuse them as they are provided in a form of ziplock baggie, once finished you can put them back onto the sticker board and place them back into the bag for reuse.
[[asin:b000056c86 graco pack 'n play portable playard in bugs quilt]]  being a grandmother who had a playpen for my own children i was very pleased to see and purchase this playard.  our grandson loves to pull up and walk around the edge.  i'm just sorry i didn't find it earlier.  i can cook while talking to ben and he can throw his toys out to his heart's content. he's taken a nap in it, too. i definitely recommend this for any new parent or grandparent. it's easy for one person to put up and take down.
On a recommendation of a friend, we ordered these for our daughter and began using them at 2 days old.  Not only are they similar to the Soothies provided by our hospital, these are also recommended for nursing babies, because they don't cause nipple confusion.  Our daughter has shown no signs of confusion, and takes quite well to her GumDrops.  In fact, I just ordered several more sets, as we've lost quite a few already.  Well worth the price for our family...I just wish I could order them by the dozen!
Wubbanubs have been wonderful for my little one.  He loves them and his Soothies, so I had no problem with the Soothie being attached.  And even though he's still a little young to fully grasp them, they're big enough for him to hug easily and hold on to them that way.  It's been great not to have to worry as much about pacis falling on the floor.  This one is really cute and one of our favorites.  I guess if I had a complaint, I'd ask to have more beans or filling in them to make them a tab bit heavier.
My son loves this type of pacifier.  I love how once he was old enough to put it in his mouth, the giraffe helped him to find it in the dark so he could put it in his mouth himself.  This type of pacifier on its own will bounce a good distance if tossed or spit out by baby however the giraffe helps minimize the bounce factor to about zero.  well worth the investment that we bought a second one in case the first one was lost or misplaced.  So far haven't had to pull out the backup one after almost a year.
I wasn't sure about pacifiers, but got this from a ecostore that was closing down before my child arrived and when she seemed colicky and as I read/viewed Happiest Baby on Block, I decided to dig it out of all the new baby stuff.  she isn't a big pacifier girl, but as we struggled with colicky type symptoms, I also got the traditional paci from the store.  she definitely prefers this one to the others.  it seems yesterday we dropped/lost it.  hence, I am here trying to figure out what to do to replace it.
i picked up a gift set of these bottles today at kmart for $19.99 (i know it's cheaper on amazon it i was desperate for new bottles today and couldn't wait any longer. everyone giving these bottles 1 star and saying it leaks are not sealing it properly, i'm sure. these bottles do not leak. if yours is leaking then it's a human error so tighten the bottom a little more and you'll be good to go. i'm in love with these bottles and so is my son. it does everything it says it's supposed to do on the packaging.
We were gifted these at our shower - along with some other popular orthodontic-based pacificers in more traditional shapes. With our little one's tiny face and how giant this shape looked, I didn't bother trying them. Until about 2 weeks in, when I decided to sterilize them and add them to her rotation just because.<br /><br />Well surprise! She only loves these now - to the point they actually work and help her quiet down to sleep (no idea about nipple confusion, we exclusively pump) and we ordered more!
if you get out of the house at all, you should get this! unless you just want to hold your baby in you lap while he grabs at your food and everything else you have within reaching distance!<br /><br />it was easy to use. i had no problem setting it up or taking it down. a friend saw me trying to figure out how to raise it (without reading the directions, haha) and showed me how, even though he had never seen one before. so i'd say most people should have no problem, especially if they read the directions.
immediately soft, adorable pattern, and just the right weight for a spring/summer baby.  we used these as swaddled, burp cloth, shades over the carrier, wind shield, and even as a sling support (over a moby wrap).  they have held up well in frequent washes, pack small, and have a lovely textured surface that baby loves to explore.  now that its cold, these are being layered under heavier blankets like a sheet.  very light fabric works great for us since our little one likes to pull blankets over her head.
i am so pleased with this product! i ordered this so that i could see my baby girl while she is sleeping in my bed, we co-sleep and i am usually not ready to go to bed when she does, so naturally leaving her alone on our bed was a concern. i set this up in less than 5 minutes. the picture with night vision is super clear and the sound sensitivity is great. i love that the monitor hand held is rechargeable; i hate buying batteries.   the price was well worth it and the quality is more than what i expected.
we love the infant optics dxr-5 for the price. for $100 it works great and the picture quality is pretty good. we like how quickly and easily it transitions to night vision when needed. the set up is easy and the device is intuitive. we're planning on taking it on all of our trips this year!<br /><br />the one thing that could be improved is the range of the monitor/camera. the signal drops out every once in a while, but not consistently.<br /><br />overall, great product for the price and we recommend it.
Gerber NaturalFlex Silicone Pacifier - Green / Blue    This is the one and only pacifier that I have found that my nephew will keep in his mouth.  All of the others we tried, we had to sit there and hold them in while he sucked them or they would just pop out.  Plus some of our friends are very amazed that you can look down inside the pacifier and see them actually sucking it. Great pacifier, used this style on one of my Grandchildren, and this is an updated version.  I love it, more important he loves it.
I absolutely love these pacifiers!  We got about 4 million pacifiers for baby showers (all different types).  My son was hospitalized at 5 days old, and I didn't have time to pack a pacifier for him.  The hospital gave us one of these and I really don't know what we would have done without it!<br /><br />My son is now almost 8 months and we have used these pacis the whole time.  They wash up great and are very resilient!  I love the bright, vivid colors.  For our next child, we won't even try other brands.
We are total fans of this pacifier!! Things we love about it: the pacifier stays put in the baby's mouth longer, it's easy for the baby to grab, it doesn't fall as often, it's cute, the baby can suck on the pacifier or the doll, and it's easy to find.  We is easy to wash.  Everyday we wash it with soap and water, then we have the paci part sit in a bowl of hot boiling water.  Once in a while, I put it in a basket and put it in the wash.  We got two as a baby shower gift and bought another one just in case.
this memory book is a 3 ring binder, which allows you to add more pages. it comes with quite a few pages that are so adorable! theres pages for family tree, all about mommy and daddy, baby shower, sonogram photo area, pages for firsts and favorites,  not to mention birthdays 1-5 years and more! it's also a lot prettier in person than the picture, and all the pages are very pretty. i highly recommend this if you are looking for an all in one type album. its a memory album, scrapbook, and photo album in one!
So, my grandson was complaining how nobody took him seriously, blah blah blah. I'm all like, &#34;Kid, yer 4 months old! Chill!&#34; And he's like, &#34;If I only had facial hair, people would listen to me!&#34;<br />So I got him this here thing.<br />Well, he was right. The Henryville Library now has a Jaxson Section. He spoke last night at the annual meeting of the Henryville Historical Society, and is considering running for mayor in 2016.<br />I highly recommend a mustache pacifier for every young boy.
This is the only pacifier that is perfect! Why?<br /><br />1)It is truly only one piece of silicone so it's more sanitary and doesn't trap water or dirtiness in crevices . And is safer. Others say they are one piece but actually plastic is wrapped around by silicone, and can come apart<br />2)It has the Natural shape nipple -- mimics mom's nipple<br />3)the shield is curved so it fits comfortable on the baby's face and helps it not fall out.<br />Soothie and gum drops DO NOT have all these three features!!
i use this gate to keep my two cats separated. one of them likes to &#34;attack&#34; that other sometimes, and this helps to keep them apart. i wanted something tall, so that they could not jump over it. this is the perfect height. one of my cats is only 6 pounds, and she can walk right through one set of the bars, but the other one, who is about 12 pounds, cannot fit through at all. i also like this gate because i rent an apartment, and i didn't have to put any holes in my landlord's walls to set this up.
My aunt sent me one of these when my son was born and he loved them so much I ended up ordering more, and giving some as baby shower gifts. All the mommies I know who have used them, LOVED them. They stay in the mouth a lot better than regular pacifiers and are a lot more comfortable! It was also a lot easier on me breastfeeding him because the nipple is similar to a real one. With regular pacifiers I found that they were always falling out..NOT THIS ONE! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this product for newborns and up!
i have another mattress that i wanted replaced for my toddler who is almost 3 and sleeps in a toddler bed. the first thing i paid attention to when i opened the box was the smell. there was no strong obnoxious smell which i loved. it fit her pottery barn kids toddler bed snuggly and i'm happy with the feel and so is she. there are no springs and i was a bit worried that it would have been too soft but its perfect for her. overall i would recommend this. not expensive and a great mattress for your little one.
Holds a tommee tippee pacie plus clip perfectly. I can even squeeze another pacie if I wanted, although that makes it a little tight. Really easy to clean. I wipe it out or toss it in the wash. Also easy to open with one hand. I was looking at the jujube holder and almost bought it instead of this one, but I made the right choice. My daughter was fussing the other day and I was able to hold her in one arm and grab her pacie with the other. One less catastrophe makes a difference! Did I mention it's adorable?
My baby loves his Wubbanub's!! I love that they use the soothir like pacifier and the weighted toy makes it easy for baby to hold on to.  It helps bink stay in close position to baby's mouth and helps keep it from hitting the floor most of the time. They are also a great toy for baby to play with. Plus they look super cute when baby is sucking on them. My little guy pets his while falling asleep and it is the cutest thing ever! These make the best gifts as well because you can never have too many Wubbanub's!
i love that these are so cheap and easy to order.  they fit my medela pump in style advanced, and they're good quality.  i find that i have a problem with getting milk in pump tubing (no matter the brand), and once that happens then it will continue to happen (even if you clean them out).  so it's easier for me to just have extra tubing on hand.  once they get milk in them a few times, i just change them out.  i also like having a second set to use when i'm cleaning out one set, since they take a bit to dry.
This is the second spout guard I purchased.  The first was hard plastic and kept falling off the spout totally defeating the purpose of buying it in the first place. This one is so much better.  It fits very snug creating a very safe spout.  My 22 month old granddaughter loves to play with the water flowing from the spout and now I don't have to worry about her hitting her head.  I am completely happy with my purchase and would recommend it to anyone interested in creating a safe environment for little ones.
i have 2 year old twins and we are still using these cribs. i have loved them the entire time. they set up easily. love that the instructions are on the bottom platform so you can't lose them. we have gone through the chewing stage, there is bite marks but you can only see them when your up close. we are expecting our 3rd baby. i'm do happy that this crib is still available. i will be buying another one. i love that it will grow with our children and we only have to buy them one bed. they are beautiful cribs!
I was leery of giving my breastfed baby a pacifier, but at ten weeks I realized it was what would help him relax during the witching hour as an oversupply prevented him from finding comfort at the breast. He loves to stick his thumb in the hole, which is cute and I think will help him wean from it in the future. His thumbs are getting beefier and I think he'll soon prefer that to the pacifier. You definitely need this 6 pack as pacifiers disappear quickly! Also, my baby has had no nipple confusion with these.
I love this product! I try to use natural things for my baby and this pacifier is perfect. I'm pregnant with my second child and plan on using again. I recommend using this pacifier above all other natural rubber pacifiers. I have tried the natursutten ones and do not like them at all!! The way the little handle is it jus collects fuzz and dirt that you cannot get off! Absolutely horrible! So I recommend this product above all others.. And I think my daughter would agree! She loves it too! :) hope this helps!
These are the only paci's that our baby girl will take.  Everything else she spits out of her mouth pretty much immediately.  I'm not sure if it's the shape of the nipple (or what) but she loves them.  We also bought MAM bottles after finding out she loves the pacifiers so much.  The nipple for the bottle is the same as the pacifier. Plus the bottles are anti-gas/anti-colic bottles that allow air to release from the bottom.  They are great at keeping our baby from swallowing air and making her gas even worse.
This style of pacifier ended up being our first child's favorite &#34;binky&#34;.  We were not able to attach it to the standard clips so we spent lots of time chasing it around and then cleaning it whenever it dropped on the ground.  I saw someone with a WubbaNub after my first child had given up pacifiers.  I made sure to buy two of these for my second child and he loved it.  It gives them something to cuddle and hang on to while they suck away.<br /><br />I recommend these for any parent open to pacifiers.
anyone reviewing this product saying they don't work is not using them correctly.  they are a dream, and if you have the right size and make sure they cover the cloth completely, they will not leak.  it obviously takes more time in changing, but saving us hundreds, maybe thousands.  we still use disposable in the wee hours of the morning and when we travel, but other than that...<br />after a disposable diaper blow out or two, we have started to use these over disposables when she is in her fine sunday dress!
My daughter (now 3) has been using these since she was a newborn. The other pacifiers would fall right out of her mouth (cue screaming baby in the middle of the night), but these seemed to stay in...This has been her favorite pacifier by far, so I bought it for our 2nd baby on the way. She never had a problem with it creating a ring around her face.<br />The colors I received are blue and green (as pictured), and they were translucent, not opaque like the other Nuk pacifiers I have seen. Perfect for the price!
we used this \\night light\\ in our room when our infant was still sleeping in there near us at night. she got used to seeing the lights as she went to sleep, so when we transitioned her to her crib in the nursery a few months after she was born, the lights were familiar. we also took the turtle with us when we traveled, so she would have something familiar there too.   worked great!   we love the soft light, and assume it will be something our daughter keeps for much longer than the rest of her \\baby\\ toys.
i'm not sure which one of us likes the swing more, me or my son. he will swing / play in this swing for hours. he is fascinated by the stars that hang overhead, and the gentle rocking motion is great when he is fussy. it is battery operated, but seems to be gentle on use. we are still on the same batteries after 2 months of regular use. the swing is easy to fold and stores easily. not as portable as the small swings, but is constructed much better than those and is still easy to take down and throw in the car.
I mean, this is a must for him (and for me). This is the piece that makes my son sleeps! I am telling you, my house is full of these pacifiers they are all over the place. You can never go wrong with this. The one comment I would make is to makre sure you pick the correct one based on the baby's age. My son is 10 months now and he still does not like the 6+ months one (they are thicker). This product with time and after you sterilize them so many times it will get a little bit thiner but it works like a charm!
i ordered this pillow for my 21 month old. she's just starting to play &#34;night night&#34; and ask to use our pillows when sitting on our bed or the couch. this is perfect. it's a great size for her and the pillow is so super soft. i am glad i purchased this for her. we also bought the toddler pillowcase that accompanies the pillow which was also a great material and fit very well. i would definitely recommend this product and plan to purchase future pillows as my daughter grows from a little pillow co.&#34;.
my grandson is autistic and he is 6 years old. he loves these numbers and letters especially the numbers; he will hold a set of numbers up and say 25, or 82, etc...  i'm sure you may have been expecting possibly a review on a toddler or pre-k child. just know that these work well in the tub (although he likes to carry them when he gets out), the colors of course aide in the visual part.  they do exactly what they should; they help teach him. and heh they out a smile on his sweet face.:)<br />thanks so very much!
This is the second wubba nub I bought for my daughter. I got her first one as a shower gift. She has the lamb, monkey & pink elephant. She is almost 6 months & this was the last one I got for her at 5 months. She LOVES it and never really took a pacifier until these. She loves to put the animal in her mouth too & she chews on it. Many people think they're a pain because you can't clean them but I throw them in the washing machine all the time with her laundry. I don't put it in the dryer...I just let it air dry.
We bought these for our son once he was about 3 months old and switched him over from the [[ASIN:B0045I6IAO Philips 2 Pack AVENT Soothie Pacifier, Green, 0-3 Months]].  It took him a little while to get accustomed to them but accepted them pretty much right away, so we never had to test out any other pacifiers.  I highly recommend buying a couple of packs of these since they always seem to disappear!  Make sure to get a [[ASIN:B004323NHS Booginhead PaciGrip Pacifier Holder, Delicate Dot Green]] to attach to it!!
received this as a baby shower gift for my now nearly 2 year old, and i still use it constantly, year round. when she was a newborn, this blanket was awesome at keeping her warm during the winter house-car dash and for naps in the car. i baby wore and i frequently just tied this blanket onto my carrier and tucked under the ends if the weather got chilly. perfect for walks in the stroller. great all-purpose, no bulk, packable, easy travel, usable long-term item that will make your life easier, not more cluttered.
this kidsline b is for bear baby crib bedding set is so adorable.  i had a difficult time finding a neutral teddy bear theme until i found this one -- it is perfect for either a baby boy or girl.  the materials are soft, nice, and durable -- not the cheap, scratchy materials that you find in similarly priced bedding sets.  the only difficulty that i encountered was finding the other matching items - lamp, mobile, etc. it appears that kidsline no longer makes this product, so good luck in piecing it all together.
we've been using this projector for over a year now and love it! the music is soothing, which was great during the long nights of nursing. now that our daughter is a toddler, she loves flipping the pages, turning the night light on and off, and just laying there watching the images on the ceiling. if she wakes up at night, she just turns on the music by herself, and falls back asleep. the remote is a great extra feature. we are expecting another baby, and i will be getting the same projector for him/her as well.
We have these pacifiers for our daughter. What I like about them is how they fit in her mouth. Some pacifiers are too big or too long, this size is a 'more normal' size. I also like that they are easy to clean due to how they are made. Other pacifiers water can get into them and it is hard to get the moisture out. However, these are shaped differently and the water stays out of the pacifer. They last long too (our daughter used them for a long time and is now 18months and we had no problem with them wearing out).
i'm 100% satisfied with the kidco convertible crib bed rail i purchased.  it was a simple set up and has been durable and reliable.  i was looking for something that would keep my 2 year old from rolling out of bed - but wanting a rail that wasn't as large, tall and bulky as the other bed rails i was seeing everywhere.  the height is exactly what i wanted and it is of good quality.  i am so pleased i found this on amazon, its been a great purchase!  thanks kidco for making a common sense, good quality product!  ;)
this booster seat is the best...no annoying straps that no one uses and just get in the way... soft and easy to stay on<br />and easy to stay in the chair where you place it.  love the orange color as it blends with my decor.  my grandson was<br />delighted when it arrived and we were able to remove the two phone books he had been sitting on.  (it arrived in a speedy<br />manner as well) i am more than delighted with this purchase....and his other grandmother upon hearing my praise, bought<br />one too...in black.
this product is a life saver. my son was 4 weeks old & only sleeping 1-2hrs at a time before i found this product. within a week of getting the wedge system & pairing it with a swaddler, he slept through the night! it makes him feel more secure & it gives me piece of mind knowing that he can't turn over in his sleep. he is now 6 mos old & still using it every night. such a simple product that made such a huge impact in my life. i would recommend it to anyone struggling to get their baby to sleep through the night.
this bag was perfect for what we needed.  we did not, in fact, notice that it was for gate check, and we checked it with our big suitcases at the ticket counter.  it stood up fine for 2 flights (or 4 flights, we had lay-overs), and also made for a convenient way to lug the car seat from the car to the airport.<br /><br />it was definitely worth the money.  it packs up very small and kept the car seat in good condition during the trips (we even stowed a baby ride-on toy in the bag with the car seat on the way home).
we had originally purchased the keekaroo right height high chair [[asin:b0044r7g8e keekaroo height infant mahogany chocolate]] and we were not satisfied at all!  after returning the keekaroo and getting this one i have not regretted it once!  this chair is awesome!  it is so easy to clean and get my son in and out of.  there are two trays and one \\cover\\, i love that you can use it with two kids by making some adjustments.  it is just a really well thought out, well made chair.  i would definitely recommend this.
we enjoy this baby monitor very much, as it picks up on sounds very well. the quality of sound is very good. we put it a little further away from the baby, but the device still picks up on her crying very well. we also love the fact that it chooses it's own frequency, so that you know only you can hear your baby, no neighbors can listen in. the night light is a bit weak and the price is a bit high. nevertheless, it does what it's supposed to do very well and we consider it a wonderful product, with great technology.
We tried almost every single brand of binky in our household. These were the only ones my son likes. I love the handle (and the ease of attaching the Avent leash). I like the air vents. The best part is that the pacifier can be put in his mouth upside down or right side up. This allows him to self sooth if he pulls the paci out. I highly recommend these.<br /><br />Note: If you have a question regarding nipple confusion we had no issues with these. He can go from breast to bottle to paci and back again without issue.
my wife and i decided to use cloth diapers.  we put all our dirty cloth diapers in this pail liner each day.  we have two of these bags and a few other brands that have failed in one way or another.  each day once a day i flip the bag contents into the washer and the bag inside out.  this brand of bags has better stiching than others that came apart after a month or so.  better quality makes a big difference when you wash something every day.  also the bag matterial itsself holds up well compaired to the lesser bags.
The hospital gave us one of these when my son started crying just as we were taking him home the first day.  We then tried some orthodontic pacifiers and the Gumdrop.  But with those, he did not like the conforming face shield (so much that within the first week he would shield his face using his hands).  So the round Soothie shield (even if it looks ugly) was the only thing he would take.    The only issue I have is the fact that our pacifier tethers don't work with it.  But I'll chalk that up as a learning expense.
So I was playing some scratch offs the other day and finally won big. 20,000 dollars, changed, my life. I am not so well eduracated and dont have my peeachdee or anything fancy like that. I am just a simple girl who got pregnant while working at the mac donalds. Now when I take my baby places people stop and stare. Every time I go to the walmart and swipe my EBT card the cashiers give my baby and her pacifier attention. I tell you what, nothing compliments 200 dollars in beef jerky like white gold in your babies lips.
Glow in the Dark pacifiers are a lifeline to parents who need sleep.  We don't just put one or two in the crib, we put four, five or six.  When our precious child wakes in the night and gives a cry, we can see on the child monitor that our baby reaches out to find a pacifier, and once in the mouth, our baby goes back to sleep.  WONDERFUL!!  Before, we were sleep deprived when awakened during the night over and over and over.  Now... having to get up in the night is an unusual night, versus an every night trip.  THANKS
this gate sees a lot of action at our house. we are constantly opening and closing it and there is quite often a toddler trying his hardest to break the whole thing down. it has held up to all of our abuses and is an excellent gate overall. the gate was really easy to install, i did it myself in about 10 minutes. opening and closing it is really easy for me, but my toddler has yet to figure it out. we use it at the bottom of the stairs to keep him from going up and it has served us well. great price, highly recommend.
i'm very directionally challenged, so it probably took me a little longer than most to put this together.  however, once i got the hang of it and actually paid attention to what the directions said...things moved along quite fast.  it's very sturdy, and the changing table is removeable, so my son will be able to keep this for a while.  the entire unit is much larger than i expected, which was a plus, and it is the same height as the matching crib, which really pulls the whole room together if you're as anal as i am :)
i am an experienced grandmother of nine, who always loved these for my our children and grandchildren and i also did home visiting for at-risk moms and toddlers who loved learning to call out names and colors and to compare sizes and have conversations about stacking up, falling down, nesting, etc.  we like that there are eight cups, with numbers on the bottom and a great learning tool!  recently i bought two more sets - for my niece and for my sister who is also a wonderful grandma needing more good toys in her home.
this light blue one looks like a scarf on my daughter.  navy and red look like western bandanas (so cute!).  absorbs like a dream.  well made.  wish all our bibs were these...we would only need 3 per day instead of 6 of the cheapos.  i have 7 in different colors and use 1 per day.  i save it for when we go out so that she still looks cute and her outfit isn't ruined by an ugly/huge bib.  if only i could afford 21 of these!  (had to buy some colors directly from silly billy's website, but shipping is cheap there.) love
I thought they were just adorable when I started buying Wubbanubs as gifts for friends. Now that I am a mom myself I can see how GENIUS these are!!!! Since binky's alwaysssss fall out, these animals sit on their chest and prop up the pacifier! So if he yawns it won't fall out. It is also easy to find and he likes to hold on to it and seems to cuddle with it. They are just darling and we LOVE THEM. We just buy more as they get worn out from our wear and tear. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED and definitely worth every penny!!!!!!!!!
this is much better than the stick and peel decals that you can place anywhere.  this goes on the wall just as you see (if you want it that way).  it was in about 25 pieces, but the nice thing that i wasn't expecting is inside their is a diagram on how to hang it, and the pieces are numbered.  it made putting the dotting lines up easy.  it took a little more time but looks amazing.  i have it in the kids bathroom, and it really makes the little bathroom come alive like a pirate map.  the best part is the kids love it!
If you need a nighttime binky, this is it for sure.  This keeps her little hands busy and gives her something to hold onto for that secure feeling instead of having those arms flail around.  I have a hundred pictures of her with this already.  I wish I could get different levels of binkies (6month etc) in the Wubbanub.  I only want her to have this at naptime or at night.  I dont take this everywhere.  I only purchased one but have friends that purchased 2 of the same so they can wash/clean one while the other is used.
I decided to try out these bottles after discovering that MAM pacifiers are the only ones my daughter will actually suck on. She's mostly breastfed, but when I need to work/do appointments, I use these so others can feed her formula or pumped breastmilk. It always takes her a minute to get used to drinking from it, but it's the only bottles where she isn't constantly sucking air along with the milk. I like that this package comes along with two pacifiers, too, since it seems like I'm constantly misplacing/washing them.
These are impossible to find in stores and by far the best binkys ever, as they are 1 piece and very durable,  no worries of it coming apart and choking baby,  but of course you still have to Replace it every so often just not as often as your regular binky, easier to stay in mouth as it's not that slippery material other brands use (not to mention any brands) i have used these on all my 4 kids and now my granddaughter.  This price is great and you get a spare. Shipping was right on time,  will continue buying them here
i highly recommend the boba 2g! as an experienced babywearer (stretch and woven wraps) i have to say that the boba is up there at the top of my favourite carriers list. we're on a tight budget so price was definitely a deciding factor but if you're considering a soft structured carrier, don't let the lower price of the 2g fool you into thinking that it's not as good as a beco or ergo. my 19lb, 14 month old rides comfortably on my back or front  and i can wear him for extended periods of time without getting a back ache.
This is the most awesome product EVER!! I highly recommend it! My son is tongue tied which means he can't stick out his tongue. All the other pacifiers would constantly pop out of his mouth. I would have to hold it in for him. With this, the little animal hold in his nu-nu. This is my 3rd child and all three have this condition which is not able to be surgically corrected until 4 months of age. I cannot thank whoever came up with this idea enough! Thank you, thank you, thank you!     Ps- It's next to impossible to lose!
when i decided to use cloth diapers, i bought a variety of different brands and types to try. these are my favorite. i like that there is only two sizes and that they are easily washable and dry fast, so you need less covers to go through the day (as compared to pocket diaper covers which get wet together with the cloth insert)- i only need three! i use them with bummis cloth diaper inserts and bumkins flushable liners. there is also a version of this diaper cover that has snaps, but i find them a bit cumbersome to use.
we bought two of these, one for our almost 3yo and one for the 9mo and couldn't be happier.  because of space both girls sleep in graco pack and plays and these are just what we needed.  they fit perfectly and make the bed so much nicer.  an added benefit is that i am short and the three inches this raises the bottom up makes it easier for me to put the baby down when she is sleeping.<br /><br />i would highly recommend this for anyone using their pnp as a place where baby regularly sleeps.  good quality at a good price!
I carried this thing rather awkwardly on my purse for weeks before figuring out that it snaps absolutely perfectly on to the side of the carseat handle. It doesn't get in the way when moving the handle back & forth, either. I've seen at least one review mention that it only fits 1-2 pacifiers, but I have at least three crammed in there. Easy to clean; super convenient--I always know where to find a pacifier! Plus, I never doubt whether or not they're covered in icky stuff after being at the bottom of the diaper bag, etc.
i bought these cups to get my 2 year old daughter to start learning to drink from a more regular type cup instead of her \\sippy straws\\ and \\sippy cups.\\  these are closer to drinking from the real thing, but with a lid.  note:  this product is not spill proof!  i didn't expect it to be! the lids just slow spills down.  it is a training cup for toddlers, not a spill proof sippy cup.  it is exactly what i was looking for!!!! they're dishwasher safe and microwave safe.  i love these cups!  very happy with the purchase!
My 3 month old prefers to suck on her fist than a pacifier - probably because they fall out so easily and she doesn't have the motor skills to put them back in, yet. But with the Wubbanub she is able to maneuver it with her arm/fist so that if the paci part comes out she can push it back up towards her mouth. We got this yesterday and she took to it IMMEDIATELY! She seems to love grasping at it while she is sucking and she is sucking at it like a champ. Finally we're able to soothe her so easily. Plus it's darn cute, too!
the nipples don't collapse, there aren't a million pieces, and they don't leak. everything i need.! note: if the nipples do start to collapse, it's because the little vent has gotten stuck or sealed. simply pinch it from the inside and that fixes the problem. also, i once had the experience where the milk was coming out way too fast. this was because the vent had been turned inside out during cleaning and hadn't popped completely back into place. once i got the little vent to it's proper position, the problem was resolved
this is a truly high quality lunch bag. although it may seem pricey, the quality of this product is outstanding.  we have used it with our toddler for almost 2 years and it is still in the same great shape it was when we bought it.  no issues with the seams or zippers and every spill you can imagine has easily come out in the wash.  the color hasn't faded a bit either.<br /><br />although it is not an insulated lunch bad, it keeps my daughter's lunch cold for up to 4 hours when i add a cold pack to the bag with her lunch.
We first found these three years ago when our first was a baby. They are so cute, but are really great because it is harder to lose than just a soothie. They can not roll out of the crib in the middke of the night and a child can easily find it in their crib and put it back in their mouth when they want it. My daughter is two and still has hers, but she got a hold in the soothie part and was very upset. It wpuld be nice to be able to change those out. We just sewed a new one on. It doesn't look that great but she loves it!
this thermometer is just wonderful.. to start things off, the price, is perfect, it's not too expensive, and the price is as good as the quality, so it won't break after a few uses. i love how it's infrared, so it does not require end probe caps, which can get pretty expensive, with that being said, it's pretty healthy, just wipe it clean after use. the size also makes it really portable, which is wonderful for when you're taking long vacations, you never know if you'll need it! i'd recommend anyone to get this thermometer.
i was worried that my children (3 and 1) would be freaked out by this, but they love it, and even ask for it!  we don't use the music feature much, but they giggle as it tickles their noses.  it is easy to take apart and clean, and equally as easy to reassemble.  my kids have less hidden in their noses than i thought, but i can still tell that this is being effective (especially on particularly runny days).  i would def suggest this to anyone who has children who cannot blow their noses, either from age or healthy problems.
I tried giving my newborn MAM pacis and she wanted nothing to do with them. After having a thumb sucker and another child who took Soothies I wanted one of my kids to take ortho pacis, but no luck. She is EB, so I didn't think a paci with a nipple that didn't resemble a real nipple would work anyway so went ahead and ordered these. My 2 year old uses Soothies so she had already claimed all the green, pink, and purple ones. I didn't want their to be jealousy with the transition of a new baby so I got yellow for the new baby.
this wrap is amazing! i have two of them so i can keep one in the car and one in the house.  i have been stopped numerous times by strangers who asked where to get this sling and i can't stop raving about it to all of my mommy friends! getting baby in and out of is a breeze and i couldn't be happier about being able to nurse discretely while in public.  i would recommend watching the included dvd as it shows how to position your baby and even shows how you can get twins in it! i can't speak highly enough about this product!
We have tried every other design of pacifier out there and our son just seems to like these the most bar none. They are designed well and just LOOK like they would be more comfortable than the others... The little ridge vent in the design does work also to reduce suction.. You just have to make sure to rinse it extra well as formula and food when they get a bit older will get in the ridge... It rinses right off with an extra second, but just calling attention to it... The stages (0-3mo,3-6mo,6-12mo) seem to be about right...
i love this necklace and so does my daughter. i feel like i can throw it on with any outfit and it look adorable. i get compliments every time i wear it. the other day we went to visit a friends new baby. i didn't want to bring a ton of stuff with me so i wore my mama & little necklace and it entertained my daughter the whole time. plus, she's always pulling on people's necklaces already so she loves that this is one she's actually allowed to chew on. i will definitely be ordering other stuff from this company in the future.
We have 3 of these. My only complaint is that the bunny's string on its mouth came untied.<br /><br />They're not hard to wash. Just annoying. I use a little liquid hand soap, do a light scrubbing, rinse, wring out, roll it up and twist in a wash cloth and then let dry over the side of my dish draining rack. It can take up to a day for that.<br />They're easier to find in a car, at night, more noticed when dropped. Easier for baby to find it. My little girl loves to hold the ears. If they weren't $12+, we'd have more than 3.
i love the avent product line.  since i last used them, they have definitely improved.  with the new rings that hold the nipple in place, i don't have any issues with the bottles leaking.  this was a very nice surprise and a change that i don't mind completing an extra step for.  as usual, they hold up great and limit the fussiness.  the pacifier covers are lifesavers since i hate putting them into the diaper bag without protection.  with the cover, i no longer have to put the pacifiers into a ziplock bag to keep them clean.
When my daughter was very little she loved this kind of pacifier, but it would always fall out of her mouth and she would get mad. I got this to help 'hold it in'. Of course shortly after she decided she no longer wanted a pacifier and turned into a &#34;thumb sucker at bedtime only&#34; kind of girl. However, she still LOVES to play with this. She chews on the pacifier as a teether, and likes to toss around the caterpillar. So even though we don't use it for it's intended purpose, I still highly recommend it. It's adorable!
this is one of the best 12 bucks i have ever spent in my life. my baby simply adores this toy. i never thought he will hang on to any toy for so long. it has been 4 months since i got this my baby is 7 months now and this is still his favorite. the designer of the toy has been so thoughtful of the colors, patterns, fabric material etc so well. my baby has got amused with every little thing dangling from the toy even today. he looks at it as if he is looking at it for the very first time. love it when i see my baby get amused.
My baby is not a very big fan of pacifiers, she spits them out almost instantly. We have tried several different brands and types of pacifiers. The Phillips Avent Soothies are the only ones that she wont spit out. We have about 4 of these just in case they drop or get dirty. These pacifiers are advertised as &#34;helps calm and soothe newborns&#34; and I truly believe this, once we give our baby the pacifier she calms down right away. I would definitely recommend these pacifiers if your baby has a problem with all other ones.
Used this passy for both kids...and both loved them!  I love the fact that they have space for nose...Always hated that the soothie passy given to me at the hospital covered the nose.  Only issue I had with this passy was with my first son...the inside piece broke after being steped on and punctured the outside of passy...allowing water to get inside and mildew!  After I ordered this...I found out that they are now being sold at Walmart...with my first baby...I was only able to find them on-line.  Friend got me the first one!
I ordered this for my two month old baby boy because every night when we put him to sleep he wanted his pacifier as comfort and every time his binky fell he would search for it with his eyes closed and when he did not find it that caused him to wake up and cry. With this WubbaNub Puppy it held the pacifier in place most of the time and gave us and him better sleep at night. We also lose a lot of pacifiers so the stuff animal made it easier for us to locate where we misplaced his pacifier. Would definitely purchase this again.
My baby started using at two months.  Much better than Havana brand.  Round nipple is most like my nipple so deters less from breastfeeding.  The rubber is much more pliable and soft.  The mouthpiece is much bigger than all other pacifiers...my baby prefers it...it stays in her mouth better and more imitates how the breast fits in her mouth (sits at the back of mouth)...very happy with product and hard couple days when we lost it and had to use whatever natural rubber brand local store carried until new ecopiggy was delivered.
ordered this to make christmas gifts for grandparents and they were a hit!!  this kit is super easy to use and they best part is there is little to no mess.  many of this kits i looked at you had to mix the clay up but with this one all you have to do is take it from the package and mold it in your hands for  a few minutes.  my only recommendation is the instructions say the final molds only need to sit for 3 days however it you want to write something on the back of your ornament i would recommend letting them sit for a week.
If I had seen this in a store I would have never bought it because at first I thought it was impratical. But after seeing such good reviews and seeing that the price wasnt steep I caved, and I'm so happy I did. Trust me when I say if your child likes the soothies they will ADORE this. My daughter doesnt even use the pacifier half the time and she loves the monkey. She has three of these (we had four but the dog ate one) and we keep one in the main areas of the house and one in the carseat. It is her little travel buddy, SO CUTE
Its a real problem. I think we have most of the ones that are currently made. My little man will only take a soothie pacifier, and the animals are small enough that he can hold on to them. Plus they are adorable! The alternatives come close, but aren't quite as cute or practical. (I like that the pacifier is attached to the animals mouth as opposed to the back of the head like some of the others). The only thing I wish was different is I wish the pacifier could be separated from the animal for cleaning or changing out pacifier.
We thought a pacifier pocket was an unnecessary item before we had our first baby, but quickly realized it would be much nicer to have one than not to. Having this attached to our diaper bag sure beat wrapping our baby's pacifier in a small towel and sticking it in there!<br /><br />What I like about this particular one is that it's simple, sleek, cute, and is the perfect touch to my skip hop diaper back in the black onyx design. It also goes well with our skip hop wipes holder/dispenser in white with the red dot. We love this!
we have 2 toddlers under 3 years old. one of them has no interest in the oven. the other one seems to be constantly attracted by it. our oven is some italian brand and the other safety devices i tried on it did not work well. this one took some creativity to install too, because the gap between the oven door and the body was a little too small, but in the end i was able to find a place to put and it fit like a glove. i could not have hoped for a better product for the purpose. &#34;thank you&#34; to whoever designed this thing.
Unlike most pacifiers on the market, that are listed as 0-3 months...these are actually made for newborns. They are better than any of the other pacis that are more expensive.The nipple on these are smaller and easier for them to attach to. The pacifier is hollow in the middle so they can actually suck the pacifier and keep it in their mouth without you holding it the whole time. The work great in steamer or the dishwasher to sanitize. This is truly a MUST purchase, regardless of you like pacifiers or not...a great back up plan!
Wubbanubs have been wonderful for my little one.  He loves them and his Soothies, so I had no problem with the Soothie being attached.  And even though he's still a little young to fully grasp them, they're big enough for him to hug easily and hold on to them that way.  It's been great not to have to worry about pacis falling on the floor.  This one is great for little girls and boys, so I like to give them away as gifts.  I guess if I had a complaint, I'd ask to have more beans or filling in them to make them a tab bit heavier.
i absolutely love these. i had a friend that gave me some as a gift for my toddler and infant. i have been unable to locate these so i saw this being offered for a review so i jumped for them. not only have i used them but i also wanted them so it worked great. it is hard locating spoons that a toddler will like and an infant will like. neither one likes metal in their mouth nor do they care for that hard plastic that cuts their mouth. these spoons are great, safe, and easy to clean. i am not sure who loves them more. me or them!
i bought this as a gift for someone who has a baby plus two other pre-school age children. the baby has had frequent respiratory infections since birth and i have to believe the nasal aspirator will be a welcome addition to their baby's care. before mailing it to the parents,  i took it to work with me to show some of the ladies that i work with. they were all impressed with the way it was made and the easy assembly, easy to take apart for cleaning and the carry case. it looks like a great product, i just have not used it myself.
My breast-fed, finger-sucking infant has no interest in conventional pacifiers. He likes the Natursutten pacifiers because they're easy to hold and great fun to chew on. He can easily put this pacifier in his own mouth and take it out as he pleases. He doesn't use the pacifier much for sucking, as he still prefers his fingers, but loves to chew on all parts of it. I have found it to be easy to clean and maintain (I oil it with extra virgin olive oil after washing it so that it looks like new). A little pricey but worth it for me.
i love, love, love this for garland for decorating the wall above my son's crib.  we didn't want anything permanent for decor in our baby's room because they grow out of those murals/infant wall art so quickly.  this is colorful, cheery and tasteful.  relatively inexpensive too when you consider how pricey decorating a room can be.  plus, we can use this when #2 comes along, boy or girl, and aren't locked into something gender specific!  this is contemporary without being super modern, and goes well with any color paint / bedding.
i looked all over in stores for a pillow the right size for my son's bed, but couldn't find one anywhere. so, i turned to amazon and am so happy with the little sleepy head toddler pillow i ordered. it is sized just right for a toddler bed. i teach preschool, and i intend to recommend this product to the parents of my students for use during naptime. i agree with other reviewers' assessments of the customer service. i had no issue with my product, but received an email asking if i was completely satisfied. that was a first for me!
We've always used AVENT brand pacifiers and our daughter has never had a problem with them. We boil them for 2-3 minutes before giving them to her, and put them in the dishwasher regularly. They clean very well, and they are durable. The only thing is that when we hand wash them with dish soap, the soapy water gets into the inside of the nipple from the handle part, like the picture part of the binky. So we have to hold the pacifier nipple-side-up and squeeze the nipple for the water to come out. Otherwise we love these pacifiers.
got mine a while back before it was available on amazon and love it!  it's true that the holes are small, but i usually take my son's shoes off before i put him in and it's a piece of cake.  my son also likes to stand up, which he can do, but since he's buckled in i don't worry about him falling out.  he can reach groceries, but he'd be able to reach them if he weren't in the seat, too.  really the only draw back is that literally every time i've used it i've had people ask me where i got it.  but that's really not a negative. : )
These funny little pacifier/animal combos have been a lifesaver! They generally stay in baby鈥檚 mouth a little longer than a standard pacifier and give her something to hold on to. The attached pacifier is a Soothie, which is the only type of pacifier our daughter would take. I also got a few extra Soothies to stick in the diaper bag for emergencies. Not to mention these Wubbanubs look adorable! Our favorite is the giraffe. (If you ever happen to run into him, ours is named Carl). This was featured on my Top 10 Items for Baby list!
i have a baby with acid reflux and realized i kept on lifting the back of my heel up to keep her at an incline with her boppy pillow.  after my heel started throbbing in pain one day, i saw this pillow and gave it a shot.  well worth the money spent!  i love this pillow and so does my daughter.  she falls asleep comfortably on it after feeding and has a natural incline so my heel can take a break now.  i highly suggest this pillow.  and i even had to throw it in the washer and dryer after the first few days and it washed very well.
I'll keep it brief.  I had resigned myself to the fact that my daughter was just one of those babies that doesn't like pacifiers.  We had tried literally 5 other brands of pacifiers before the binky, and i really wish I'd just bought this one first.  With every other pacifier, she would make this disgusted face, and nearly spit it out of her mouth.  Imagine my surprise, when, at 3 months old, I gave her the binky, and she sucked away happily.  I thought maybe it was a fluke at first, but it always stops her crying.  It's a godsend!
we love this product. we actually have this in addition to a travel system, but we use this far more often. it even has more storage in the bottom basket than the larger travel system stroller. it weighs far less than the travel system stroller, and takes up less space in the trunk. we use it in restaurants frequently! the slings that restaurants provide take up much more space than this item! plus, this item is much more stable than a restaurant sling that could topple if bumped. the push bar can be dropped for added space saving!
Great in helping to keep her Ci-Ci in her mouth with just a little weight to keep it from falling out. It helps if she puts her arm or hand behind its head and a gentle fall out of her mouth is quickly recovered but it doesn't survive a spit out or quick fall out---still great! One less time to reach over to put it in. I'd say it helped to keep it in 30% more than without. It also is great for her to snuggle and suck to soothe! Definitely helps that soothies are one of her favorites too. Great! Soft! Comforting in more ways than 1!
this mirror has been great! i have had other mirrors that i have purchased from stores near by and found them to be cheaply made or the mirror was flexible and warped the reflection to make it hard to use. this one straps on easily and is very secure. i have a small suv and have no problem seeing my son in the back seat. the swivel mount is sturdy and seems to stay in place but does lack a little in rang of motion but doesn't detract from the product. i gave it 5 stars because i feel that it is great for the price and what it does.
i purchased the frames to decorate my baby girl's nursery. i love that they match almost any background color (especially pastels in every tone like pink, peach, green, yellow etc.)! in my case, my baby's nursery is a very delicate light peach color and the frames look absolutely beautiful with it. they are exactly as described, not too small or big, just the right size to decorate a wall. the only con i could find is that they have a strong odor when you first take them out of the package. other than that, well worth the purchase.
i first received a free sample of bamboobies from a sampling event on facebook and when i tried them i fell in love with them, i then immediately went out and bought a whole box! they are so soft and comfortable. all the other nursing pads i have tried stick to my nipples the first time you leak even the smallest amount and they do not stay aligned with my nipples throughout the day. the bamboobies nursing pads are perfect there was no sticking, leaking, smell, or movement from the pads. i have found my new favorite nursing pad!!!!
The Munchkin Pacifier for newborns is wonderful.  My son & daughter-in-law received several different kinds of pacifiers from friends and family.  The only one my grandson will use is the Munchkin. The nipple has a longer, more slender design than the others they tried, and is made from soft silicone.  The pacifier is also designed so as not to block the baby's nostrils.  I also appreciate that it's dishwasher safe.  I will definitely be buying the larger sizes as my grandson grows.  Wish I'd had these pacifiers for my own children.
While my daughter only used this product for a month before she gave up on pacis all together, this was a seriously beloved item in our home. She was so cute with this in her mouth as she would learn to touch/grab the giraffe. She was about 5-7 months when she had this- so it was very helpful in development in my opinion. I am unsure of their sizing though. It seemed as if it wasn't going to last very long with the nipple sizing and I couldn't find the next size up in the soothie. So, I was glad she just dropped the whole paci idea.
I believe we have ordered this wubbanub monkey about 4 times. My daughter has loved wubbanubs since she was born (she is 2-1/2 now) and the monkey is her favorite. since she does have a full set of teeth the pacifier will get cracks in it and we cannot give it to her anymore. We just order another one and she doesn't know the difference. She has also had the wubbanub duck, giraffe and baby doll. When the pacifier got a hole and needed to be removed from the baby I just detached it and now the baby is her favorite thing in the world.
My 4 month old loves this thing. He will only sleep swaddled, and when I would lay him down his binki would fall out. I'd put it back in and hold it in place until he drifted back to sleep then he'd drop it again and wake. Now, I place his WubbaNub on his chest with the binki in his mouth and when he drops or spits out the binki, it's still right there in reach for him to latch on to it as he pleases.  Of course, when he squirms it sometimes fall off his chest, but with this product I can find the paci a lot faster at night. Get one!
Priceless to have a binki that does not fall down by their neck when they spit it out.... it stays put and they can root around for it!  Perfect for the car, or for babies that are swaddled (it sits on their chest without little arms to fling it away) .  My little one loves holding it, and playing with it's ears even if she is not in the mood for the pacifier.  We have the horse, the giraffe and the elephant.  The elephant does not stay put as well as the other two because it not attached to the most solid part of the stuffed animal.
Everyone should have these pacifiers!  They are perfect for babies who don't quite have a strong sucking grip and when they fall, they are easier to find (no rolling under the sofa!).  Throw in washing machine then rinse any soap residue off pacifier.  Very durable.  When my son was 1 year, I cut the paci off the mouth of the monkey and handed it to him when he went to bed...He started to put it in his mouth then realized the pacifier was gone then he just squeezed the monkey and laid down!  No more paci after that day and no issues!
When my boy looks back on his baby photos a few decades from now, he's probably going to think his father was a weirdo. That's OK. Who knows, maybe he'll get a laugh out of them? Certainly a lot of other people do. Hmmmm. I wonder what the kid thinks when people look into the carriage and laugh at him? When does he develop his sensitivities anyway? I guess I better not use these things overly long. In any case, I've noticed various versions of these Billy Bob Teeth, and I just had to try them out. Sorry, guy.<br /><br />Gary Peterson
We liked this guys so much we ordered a second so if it was every lost or dirty we have a back up.  This little guy has saved us so many times.  He sits on our 2 month old's chest and makes it so if she stops sucking for a minute it doesn't fall out. when she was smaller we could even tuck it into her swaddle. Its also much easier to find than a regular pacifier, added bonus we didn't think of. We've been using it since day one and couldn't be happier with it.  We have the monkey one as well but it falls out much easier than this one.
I had twins at 36 weeks and they were given these pacifiers at the hospital. They both love them and won't take to anything else. I tried a different paci when we were at the store and it fell on the floor. One of my boys just cried and refused to take it. If you like something visually different, try the gumdrop pacifiers. They are awesome too. One of my boys loves that one and the other loves the Soothies, but they're pretty much interchangeable as they both have the same nipple type. The gumdrop pacifiers also come in preemie size.
Life saver!!!! This was our 2nd one, as the first one was lost. I had to order one QUICK! It got to me in a decent amount of time. Happy to say its still with us & survived the dog thinking it was a toy for her. I will definitely recommend this to friends & consider it as a gift at baby showers.<br /><br />For any first time parent reading. One reason why these are great, is because it helps the pacifer stay PUT! Huge lifesaver when you just want some sleep, but that darn pacifer keeps popping out. Much easier to find at night too! ;)
If you are a new mom and contemplating what to put on your registry or what to buy.  BUY THIS. I would put this in my top 10 things I use the most as a mom. The Avant Soothie is a great brand pacifier and since it is attached to a stuffed animal you won't lose it and they don't pop out of their mouth as easily since your baby can maneuver the animal easier that it is bigger. This one is better than the elephant we don't like that one cause the trunk makes is longer and makes it harder for baby to manipulate. Seriously best thing ever.
we used this mattress for the first time when my son was 16m old for an overnight at grandma's house. he dislikes the pack n play, but on this mattress he slept like a stone. we placed it on the pnp boards and covered it with a waterproof pad and a standard store-brand playard sheet we've used a thousand times before. it fit perfectly. i didn't find this to be too firm, too soft, too small or too noisy. (i feel like a lot of reviewers really overthink these things!) it's just a portable-sized version of his crib mattress. recommended.
my daughter absolutely loved this blanket.  once you get past how to wrap them in it, you will never let it go and panic when it is in the wash.  she would sleep so much better wrapped in this blanket.  grandma who is old school thought this was amazing.  we called her the little burrito but it worked perfectly.  after she outgrew it, she still slept with it as a blanket.  every parent should be issued one of these when their baby is born along with the baby 411 books.  two of the best products i came across and were invaluable to me.
this is baby's favorite pacifier. we named him leon. the lion, not the baby...<br />the lion has just the right amount of weight to keep him on baby's chest and assist with keeping the pacy in his mouth.<br />the pacifier is actually sewed onto the stuffed animal though, so if you are a sanitizing spazoid, you might not like this because the pacy itself can only be rinsed or wiped off. same thing with the stuffed animal- he can't go through the washing machine on account of the attached pacy. neither of these things bother us, but fyi.
My infant does not want to go to sleep.  I am convinced he purposely spits out his pacifier in a last ditch attempt to wake himself up.  I tried the Wubbanub hoping it would make it harder for him to spit it out.  IT REALLY WORKS.  My infant spits out the pacifier, but it is positioned right on his chest, so he can get it back in his mouth!  It is wonderful.  Granted, it doesn't work 100% of the time, especially when he starts rocking in his swaddle, but it has made bedtime so much more easier.  This is a must for parents with infants.
My daughter absolutely loves this little monkey who we call George.  It has been her best buddy since she was about 4 months old and she's now 13 months. She does not care about any other pacifier except for this one and never has. If a baby could be addicted to something, our is addicted to George!  For those looking for a way to wash, I just throw him into the washing machine in a lingerie bag with the rest of her clothes and let him air dry.  My only concern is how we'll ever wean her off of him because this is definitely her lovey!
stop reading the reviews and just order this thing.<br />i'd been using the bulb aspirator on my 3mo old and she was hating it ! this product worked in seconds, removing a couple tough boogers that had kept her from sleeping and nursing well for days. she hardly noticed the nose piece when i used it on her since it was soft and shaped right for her little nose. it worked so fast i surprised myself and she giggled.<br />i also  dig that the company sent a little card saying they were a small company and that reviews would help them keep
this is not an eye sore of a toy compared to the other chairs and bouncers in my opinion.  it's not too loud, and it will fit my big baby (76 percentile) unlike the other chairs which is looks to be too long for.  i also like that it was very easy to put together, and appears easy to take apart.  i saved the box it came in to that once the baby is not using it anymore i can easily store it for my next babe.  i went with the grey to save a bit a money as this is a pricey chair but i think it's made much better than the others out there.
My daughter has recently started to pull herself up in her crib. Of course she had started chewing on the crib rails. I did not want her doing this, so I bought this product. I have to admit I was a bit unsure at first as i was reading the reviews. But I decided it seemed like the best thing on the market. I am so glad I got it. It stays in place very well and DOES NOT move when she pulls herself to a standing position. I am now ordering two more of these for my sister as she has a little girl too! I would highly recommend this product.
I got this when my daughter was 2 mo old and oh my oh my, best thing EVER. She is now 2 1/2 and STILL sleeps with it only how as a stuffed animal because the binky part fell off. It made life so easy when she was little because the animal kept the binky in place and when she was older, she could easily find it. Im pregnant with my second, this time a boy, and Im ordering two for him as well. They are soft and fluffy and easy to wash in my front loader machine. Again, really really love them. 100% worth every dime I spent on them. &#60;3
after looking at lots of cribs, my daughter and i both loved the look of this one. i read other customers' reviews and many articles before ordering this davinci crib for my soon to be grandson. the rounded bars at front and back are unique to this model and offers diverse uses for hanging blankets, towels and quilts on while not in use. the crib came with good instructions, hardware and good quality wood components. the crib is well made, seems very sturdy and looks very nice in the nursery awaiting the arrival of one lucky little boy.
When I first saw these I thought they were a little goofy.  I got this for my daughter, who was 6 months at the time & she loves it.  We take it everywhere.  Usually she sucks on the pacifier, but sometimes she chews on his legs or the tags, or just throws him around.  I've washed it in the washer a couple of times and it has held up well.  After 3 months of daily use there is no sign that the pacifier is anywhere close to detaching.  The lamb is small enough that I feel safe putting it in her bed with her to hold onto while she sleeps.
Despite reading the other reviews, I was still surprised how well made this was! The beads are all wooden with quality decorations. It fits with all of the different types of pacifiers I have for my pipsqueak, including her Soothies which have really small holes, so that's a plus. I was tempted to drop it a star because I wish the attachment was spring-based instead of clip-based but I love this thing so much I'm going to let that slide. I get tons of compliments on it and have completely tossed aside the other pacifier attacher I have.
I got these as a gift at my shower.  This was for my second baby and I had used Nuks prior for the first.  I love these the best as they a) look so cute b) when they fall on the floor, the nipple falls up. I had them for awhile before I realized this advantage.  Somehow, the way it is designed, the outside is convex and the nipple almost always seems to fall up!  Easy to wash, I throw them in the dishwasher in my catchall basket.  They have held up very well. They also come in other colors.  I have clear and blue.  Love love love these!
We love these pacifiers. They are so much softer then the regular silicone pacifiers. Even if you don't get these for health reasons get them because they are much softer and gummier for the baby. We have used them since our boy was born. Even though he is breastfed, we did not have any issues with nipple confusion. He took the pacifier when he was not hungry. When he was hungry he didn't want it. They do have to be replaced once they become sticky. But for sanitary reasons it's best to replace any kind of pacifer after about 2-3 months.
love this.  i started my daughter off in this at 3 months old and she loved being able to see everything at the grocery store and i loved being able to shop with just a cart as opposed to cart and stroller or cart with car seat in it.  she moves her arms and legs a lot in excitement when she is in this so she is getting exercise too.  now she is 8 months and it still works great.  adjusts easy, easy to put on, front and outward facing.  it gets a little warm though from sharing body heat so i don't think this is a great thing for summer.
scratch-resistant lenses, flexible earpieces, and resilient frames mean these sunglasses stood up to everyday wear and tear from my 2-year-old. i came back and bought a bunch more pairs for his cousins! the toddler size works well for our kids aged 15 months and up. they look a little big on the youngest ones, but still stay on their faces fine. they aren't too small for the 4-year-old. we love the blue, pink, and green, but the red was kind of washed out. our son knows how cool he looks with these shades on and loves to strut his stuff!
our twin's favorite &#34;loveys.&#34; these are by far one of the best purchases for our boys. they sleep with these little guys and snuggle them as soon as they get in their crib. they also like to suck and teethe on the trunk. we were happy to see the fabric is breathable (and soft) as our little guys like to put them over their face. another perk is that they are washable and come out even softer than they were. the perfect first little companion for any baby!<br /><br />we've since given these as baby gifts and will continue to do so.
My 11 month old loves his &#34;nu nu's&#34; and he does not discriminate with different styles. The mustache attachments are nice and soft and also provide lots of laughs and comments about how adorable it is. The plastic is very sturdy and the clear look provides a very nice appearance. My son is enjoying this pacifier and I believe that other babies and mommies would enjoy the comfort and entertainment provided by these pacifiers. The price for two is also very reasonable and I will be ordering these for baby shower gifts in the future!
My mom used MAM bottles with us 24 years ago, so my first choice when picking a bottle and pacifier system was MAM. Our newborn took these at two days old. Absolute lifesaver when she's overtired and wants to comfort suckle when I can't just drop what I'm doing (usually changing her) and let her comfort nurse. We had 0 nipple confusion problems with these. She's gone back and forth from breast to bottle from day one. The self-sterilising feature is life-saver number two. Much easier to just pop them in the microwave than to boil anything.
we apparently have a convertible crib with huge rails.  these wouldn't even wrap half way around.  i think the narrow ones are only good for the cheaper cribs sold at big box stores.  anything of furniture quality will need the wide version.<br /><br />that said don't hesitate to buy them.  they are easy to install, remove and wash.  we looked at a few different rail covers and these were the nicest.  trend lab seems to have a supply problem though since we weren't able to get any color accept brown for the front and natural for the sides.
I did a lot of research on pacifiers and these are the only ones we've used. They are rubber, so they do smell like rubber, but that's what I expected and I don't think the smell is strong. My biggest issue has been keeping these away from dog, who has eaten 4 of them (fortunately with zero vet bills...). We got at least a month's use out of each pacifier (assuming the dog didn't eat it first). I would recommend these. A little more expensive than other pacifiers, but worth it to know what is going into my baby's mouth. And FAST shipping!!
We used nothing but Avent pacifiers for our 18 month old, but thought we'd give these a shot when we needed some new ones.  They are brilliant!!  I never realized how genius glow-in-the-dark binkies would be!  Baby loves them and they are a perfect distraction for those occasional nights when she doesn't want to get in the crib - give her one and she is absorbed long enough to conk out.  I put them directly under a lamp for 30 minutes before bedtime if possible so they glow longer --- I find them still glowing enough to find 8 hours later.
I had orignally registered for the 4 in 1 bath station.  Then I read the reviews of injurys cause by them.  Plus, my own cousin said it hurt her daughter as well.... <br />Then I read the reviews and switched to this tub.  My son and I love it.  The hammock makes it so easy to wash my 2 month old.  His body is supported so I rest his head on my arm.  I don't have to hold him up until I have to wash his back area.  He has fun kicking and pushing off of the front of the tub.   <br />It fits nicely in the kitchen sink as well.   <br />Love it!
We got our first WubbaNub as a shower gift. We didn't use immediately but after several awaken nights of our baby searching for the pacifier that rolled out of the crib, we brought it out. The animals are the perfect weight/size to help keep that pacifier from rolling around in the dark and easy for them to grab. It didn't take long before our baby was self-soothing and we never left the bed. It is now an item our toddler will not go to bed without. We have 2 - the giraffe and monkey. I must say, the monkey is probable the cuter of the two.
My daughter has had this for two montha she absolutely loves it. We dont leave the house or go to daycare without it. We even bought an extra for just in case<br /><br />Update: My daughter is now almost 18 months old and we don't go anywhere without her &#34;bug&#34; as she calls him we have gone through two. Not because of her but our dog decided to give it a try also. She loves him so much that before she pops him in her mouth for bed she gives his face a kiss. Best pacifier ever!! I will buy them for all my future kids and friends kids.
this wrap has saved my life! as a first time mom it was difficult for me to go shopping, do household chores etc with a baby in tow. after discovering the moby i am able to travel by (new york city) bus and train with a decent sized stroller. sometimes it is so difficult to close and open strollers while ensuring the baby's safety, with the moby i just put it on under my jacket before leaving the house. when i get to the bus stop or train station i just place baby in moby and ta-dah my both hands are free and baby is safe!!   get the moby!!
granted, it's his favorite thing in a very unscientific poll (he's only a few weeks old), but every time i put him on it, he finds something new and fascinating. it has just enough to keep him entertained, but not too much so that he would be overstimulated. the mat is nice and cushy, and each dangling toy has a different sound and texture. the little mirror is great because it won't break unless you're really, really determined, but it's not super flimsy. my baby looks so happy on it, and i wake up every morning looking forward to using it.
this was a great product for our young son.  he had horrible startle reflexes for a very long time and this helped relieve some of that for him so that we were all able to sleep for longer stretches in those early weeks and months.  i can see how the zipper could be perceived to be a problem when used for prolonged periods of time.  it doesn't feel really durable, but ours never broke and we didn't have issues with it.  the sizing was also accurate.  it stretches just enough to keep baby feeling secure but allowing for some slight movements.
i wish i'd gotten this when we first started doing bottles.  it does best if you do 28 ounces or less, but even if you have to make two batches, it's so much easier than making the bottles seperately.  it also does a much better job of mixing the formula, it seems to give it a completely different texture (in a good way).  i've read some reviews that it's flimsy.  thruthfully, i've washed it as directed in the top of the dishwasher and had no issues.  even if it did, i'd just shell out another 10..it's a small price for the ease it provides.
I bought these pacifiers for my daughter before she was born. I wasn't really sure what kind to get as I was a first time mom. I loved the fact that they are one complete piece, rather than the plastic piece and the rubber part. I feel like those can get gunk caught in them easier. This pacifier is still the ONLY one we use. They are kind of goofy looking while in her mouth, but she loves them, and I love that I don't have to worry about stuff getting caught in the creases of it. We will continue to use this pacifier as long as she uses one.
on nov 19, 2011, we had a major accident. my truck (2006 dodge ram 1500) slid on ice and went off the road. the truck ramped a driveway in the middle of the ditch, and rolled twice before landing upright. other than being a little upset, my 3 yr old was completely fine. no concussion, bruises, whiplash, absolutely nothing. considering my truck was a \\total loss\\ according to insurance, that none of us were seriously injured is a miracle. i am forever grateful that i bought this car seat, and am using the replacement money to purchase again.
liquid falls through, but poo dose not! fricken awesome right??? i started using cloth with my first child. and stopped once she started having nasty poops. its such a pain cleaning stuck on poop off a grovia insert. lol then my son was born, and upon doing more reading about grovia products, i saw these. they have put my daughter back in cloth, and i'm so happy! i can't even imagine the money i would have saved if i had only found these sooner! get them! i know now, that my son will be a full time, tell hes potty trained cloth diapering baby!
spending this kind of money on a diaper bag, even on sale, was a tough decision for me. i finally caved because with a toddler and a newborn on the way, i didn't want to mess with an inferior bag and end up replacing it. when this bag arrived, i was pleased with the quality of the construction as well as the lovely fabric. i've just begun to use it, but i think it will last very well. the pockets make the bag very easy to organize and the removable dirty diaper pouch and changing pad are brilliant add ons. definitely glad i made the investment!
i love this item.  my son is super tall and 2.  he outgrew halo sacks because they don't make them over an extra large and i hate the halo toddler sacks because they are fleece/polyester.  i love these sacks: great cotton material and comes in longer lengths. i also bought one for winter but haven't used it yet. you may be wondering why i put my toddler in a sack still.  well, i do it for thee reasons: he is used to it, it guarantees he is warm if he moves around and finally, he can't crawl or fall out of his crib. i highly recommend this item.
this was my second ergo.  the first one lasted daily use for about 3 years with two different kids.  i wouldn't even take it off while driving and i think the seatbelt rubbing on it shortened its life.  (i had taken the kid out while driving)  so i bought this one 3 years ago and we are still going (on kid number 3).  it is life changing.  i tried a sling and it just didn't work for me, but this does.  i got the infant insert and used it when they were little, and then moved up to using it without the insert and then on the back too. i love it.
my daughter 17 months and still loves it she has a blast. and u can adjust the height for growth weve had it frm age 8 months. shes occupied for hours and infriont of tv she spins in circle stands up ands pins rocks ect allows me to allow her to play and me to clean or mommy time i added more toys alsdo with toy links plus folds dwn to be put away or to easily transport to grandparents when they babysit indoors and outdoors. my 2yr old nephew meets the weight requirement and we put him in it as well we put seat all the way up and he loves it to
My daughter had no trouble adjusting to the new nipple design debuted by Tommee Tippee. It is more like a bottle, but still considered &#34;orthodontic&#34;. I prefer the Tommee Tippee mouthpiece design like this because it is more breathable, and less irritating to her skin. It also has the handle which allows her to hold onto them better when she takes them out of her mouth. My daughter sleeps with a nightlight, so I haven't paid much attention to the glow-in-the-dark feature, but the celestial designs are very pretty & good for a boy or girl.
I love the smaller size on this pacifier... it's perfect for little ones. I've always thought that regular pacifiers were just huge... this solves that problem.  I gave it to my two month old who had been using soothies previously; it's a perfect fit for him and does not make his whole face disappear obnoxiously.  Honestly, I am not planning on upgrading to something larger for a while... this is perfect for him even 3 weeks later at almost 3 months old.<br /><br />It's a nice, soft nipple... and a very discreet gentle color. Perfect all around!
These are the only pacifiers my kids would/will take. They love them and I've tried several others and they refuse them. One thing I don't like is that I feel like junk gets caught in or around the actual pacifier part that goes in their mouth and that disgusts me. . . I try to keep it clean but it's just one more thing to remember and I wish it could be designed so that it wasn't so hard to clean. I worry about what gets inside it as I've seen water in there and have no way of getting it out. Otherwise, I love them because my kids love them. :)
these are very soft. i was very happy to see that they are organic and the bamboo is from a sustainable forest. it said exfoliation so i was nervous about them being scratchy but they weren't at all. i was very pleased to use these on my baby, on my big kids and even on my self for washing my face. they have cute designs on them that could be given for a boy or a girl if you were looking for a shower gift or if you didn't know the sex. very nice.<br />i did receive these for free or a reduced price in exchange for my honest review as seen above.
this is a great bottle.  i got it for my 5 month old daughter who's not yet ready for a sippy cup, but wants to hold the bottle herself.  she can easily grab the handles and enjoys playing at feeding herself - even getting the nipple in her mouth most of the time.  the bottle does not leak as long as you get it together properly.  the nipple and the handles have tabs & slots that need to be aligned.  not hard to do though.  the only down side to this bottle is after i ordered it online, i found the same bottles at babies r us for half the price.
the bassinet is very beautiful and is made of strong wood! its not too heavy and was incredibly easy to put together. the only thing that went somewhat awry was putting on the wheels. they would not fit into the bottom of the legs because the inserts were much too wide and long, however this was not an issue for me because i do not intend to roll the bassinet anywhere. but if i need to move the bassinet i can because it doesnt weigh much and is easy to lift.   i would definitely recommend this product. nothing came damaged and shipping was easy.
yes, i could swaddle my infant with a regular baby blanket. however, when i was a sleep deprived parent of my newborn son i found this to be one of the greatest conveniences! it was quick and easy to get him swaddled and soothed. he looked so cozy it it. when he woke up in the middle of the night for feedings and needed a diaper change, we could do it without unswaddling his arms so it was easier to soothe him back to sleep. my wife also likes the cute designs so we are definitely getting more of these for our daughter who we are expecting soon!
My son LOVES this monkey. It doesn't fully function as it should, but he still gets a kick out of it. The chords that the pacifiers attach to are too short. My baby can barely get one of the pacifiers in his mouth, so it's difficult for him to suck on. I can understand why the chords are short, they don't want it to be a strangling hazard. Despite this, my son still loves looking at the monkey in his car seat. He'll &#34;bat&#34; at the chords and chew on the sides. The monkey stays in place, unlike his other toys on hooks that just slide around.
Only one of my twins will take a pacifier & this is the only brand she'll use, the animals attached is just a great bonus. She is able to find it if it drops out of her mouth now that she's old enough, but prior to that when she was still little the animal helped us wedge it under her swaddle so it wouldn't fall out (she is one of those babies who will scream bloody murder if she doesn't have it, lol). It has helped her establish her hand eye coordination very quickly as well. We have 5 of these things, they are a definite must have in our house!
these replacement pieces are exactly the same as the ones that come with the ameda unit.  in the image they appeared solid white to me, but when they arrived i was pleasantly surprised to find they are clear and appear to be exactly like the ones that came with the machine.<br /><br />getting these as a back-up. the first set i eventually ripped through when i used a small bottle brush to wash it.  the metal end gradually tore the plastic enough that it stopped working.  now i just use the corner of a contoured dish sponge and it works just fine.
we are so relieved that our son liked this pacifier.  He is exclusively breastfed and he is now 5 months.  After trying 5 different pacifier a friend gave me a Mexican honey filled pacifier and my son loved it.  We were scared it would pop but also I enjoyed the extra sleep, and  personal time.  I needed to find a pacifier that didn't frighten me yet he loved.  this one looks and feels just like the Mexican one.  I purchased the rounded butterfly 12 months and older.  I'm going to order a size down and keep this size for the future or as a spare.
My son almost exclusively uses Wubbanub pacifiers.  They are great - you can't lose them easily, and they keep the pacifier close so you can get it back in your baby's mouth quickly without digging around trying to find it after it's spit out.  I didn't believe it at first, but infants also like to hug the little toy.  Of the three Wubbanubs I have, the frog Wubbanub is my least favorite, only because it doesn't seem to be as weighted and falls off my son's chest easier than the duck or giraffe Wubbanub.  But it still works great and is very cute.
Wish I would have known about these a few years ago with my first daughter!!! This pacifier is a life saver. Nothing is more frustrating than having your child love a pacifier but struggling to keep it in their mouth. Finally the WubbaNub makes this possible. Its weighted so that when they are in the swing, stroller, car seat etc. it can sit on their chest and helps keep it in. If it does fall out it doesn't go far and my 6 week old daughter is able to find it with her mouth and put it back in. Thank you for the peace and quiet! Worth every penny.
My son was physically attached to his frog wubbanub as a baby so of course as I found out we were pregnant again, and this time with a girl, buying a new wubbanub was high on my list. This is a different brand then the frog we had, I'm not really sure how that works since they're both called wubbanubs but that's how it seems. Still, she loves it. I've had no problems with it sliding and I think the design is so cute! Mine is more pastel and less bright than the elephant picture on here which is exactly how I like it. Our favorite pacifiers by far!

We were given these by our birthing hospital for our twins.  They have been with us from day one and will continue to be so until our children are weaned from them.  They provide the perfect combination of a pacifier and a toy.  It gives our babies something to hold on to and concentrate on while going down to sleep.  We love these guys and have given many of these as gifts over the past year or so.  I haven't had the first complaint from any recipients.  Clean-up is easy.... throw them in the washer and wash with hot water.  it's as easy as that.
Wubbanubs are Great! They stay in place so much better than your ordinary pacifier.  Now you don't have to use one of those horrible clips to hold the pacifier onto your child's clothes.  The wubbanubs are also great for when it's time to lose the pacifier because the child doesn't want to carry it around so he gives it up himself.  I give these an A+ and wouldn't have a baby without one.  For those who say they would never give their baby a pacifier I say I can always take the pacifier away, but you are stuck with a child that sucks it's thumb!!!
We were given one of these pacifiers at the hospital when our daughter was born.  We had a few around the house that we had boughten, or were given at baby showers.  She definitly prefers these pacifiers over the rest.  They dont have latex in them, which is nice, because the last thing you would want is for your baby to have a reaction, when you have no idea what alergies they may have.  They are also BPA free, which is a must with somehting that a baby will have in their mouth!  We have about 10 of these scattered about the house.  Great product!
after nearly two years of use, i couldn't be happier with this bag. it always has enough room and everything has a place without having unnecessary pockets or folds. it's lightweight, smaller in size than a lot of diaper bags, and durable. we still use this with a toddler (even for longer trips) and plan to continue using it after he no longer needs it. we take it everywhere and love it. easy to wipe down and can be thrown in the washing machine too. this is my favorite baby item. it's not at all frou frou, but it does the job perfectly, with ease.
my son began sitting up very early and we were looking for a product that would give him adequate support, but was age appropriate. he was to young for the swing and didn't enjoy the infant seat. this product was perfect! it encouraged good sitting posture and provided the right amount of support for him. it also kept him entertained longer than similar products (i.e. baby swing, infant seat, bouncy seat) that we purchased. once my son outgrew it, we gave it to a family friend and her son loves it as well. i would definitely recommend this product!
These are the perfect no-frills pacifiers. While Munchkin makes a host of elaborate pacifiers (ones that simulate a mom's heartbeat, one's that double as rattles, etc.), these are excellent basic pacifiers for those who either are not found of the gimmicky ones (admittedly, we really LOVE the heartbeat one) or finds them cost prohibitive.<br /><br />These are approved by orthodontists. And they wash with ease.<br /><br />They come in a wide range of colors, make a perfect &#34;filler&#34; gift for that baby-shower basket, and are SUPER inexpensive!
this rail is great. nice and sturdy and once tightened and fastened, it stays there. had trouble with another brand coming unfastened. when you lower the rail it is completely out of the way so you can change the sheets without removing the rail. this is nice and long and fits clear to the mattress snugly with no gap. this was actually purchased to keep a small dog from falling on the hardwood floor when she has seizures at night. it works great and now we don't worry that she will break something having a fall. this is really worth the extra cost!
My baby was having a really hard time learning to use a pacifier.  I read reviews on this product and saw others saying it helped their babies to have something to hold onto, so I decided to check it out.  It is awesome!  My baby was able to figure out how to hold onto the toy to keep the pacifier in her mouth, and then learned to keep it in through sucking.  Now at 5 months, she loves to hold and pet this as a lovee, and she chews on all of the monkeys limbs when she isn't in the mood to suck on the pacifier. Definitely a favorite toy in our house!
this is a great monitor. at it's most sensitive setting we can hear the little one breathing at night...we usually run it around the medium setting.<br />the noise lights help when you have the tv up loud or are watching a movie.<br />the temperature display and alarms are useful if you have temperature swings in the nursery.<br />the remote unit is light and the batteries last a good while.<br /><br />the night light is no use at all, but i'm not going to take a star off just for that.<br />also, we don't use the lullabies - we have sonos for that.
We bought this pacifier as well as the Natursutten pacifiers. Our son definitely prefers this pacifier and won't even taken the Natursutten. As some other reviewers have noted, the nipple on the Ecopiggy is on the larger side and is larger than the Natursutten. Maybe which pacifier your baby prefers depends on whether he or she is breastfeeding and the size of the mom's nipples. The rubber is very similar between the two brands. Some reviewers complain about the smell of rubber pacifiers, but I didn't find either of them to have strong smells at all.
my 7 month old boy loved this mattress. he was having difficulty getting comfortable enough to sleep through the night, waking up constantly. the graco play pen i bought him had a hard and thin mattress. i began to compare different items online by reading others reviews and came across the dream on me mattress. when i first placed the mattress down he was happy stomping his feet on it trying to walk around he liked the feeling of it on his feet. and by the miracle of god he fell asleep through the entire night and morning. it's soft but firm enough.
i've been reading the reviews about people putting their babies in this in the rocking position, and that's entirely too early for this feature to be used.  the rocker part is for when the child is old enough to reach the floor with his/her own legs.  you wouldn't put a child in an adult rocking chair and you shouldn't use the rocking feature of this chair for babies either.  it's for the toddler stage.  i've had this rocker for 6+ years and none of my 3 children have ever fallen out because they've never been put in by themselves in the rocker mode.
I LOVE wubbanubs! They are amazing! They don't stay in your babies mouth unless they are holding it in so no worry about them choking on it. It is very safe! It is simply just a very cute soothe pacifier! if your little one loves the soothe then get this! It makes the pacifier so easy to find and as your little one gets older it is also a little stuffed animal they can take along. Honestly when the pacifier gets worn out you can just cut it out and sew a new soothe in. I also have thrown this in the dishwasher and washing machine. it holds up great!!
And after only giving my first born the one piece ones, and having him never really get into the whole pacifier thing, I did myself a favor and gave my second one these. I throw them all away periodically and just replace them- you can't get them clean. Make sure there isn't a 'ring' of hair and dirt where the nipple meets the plastic- if you just pull it back a little with your finger you'll see what can accumulate in a few days. And if you would never let your child suck on the same unsterilized pacifier for two days in a row, i doff my hat to you.
These soothie pacifiers are the only ones our daughter likes. She loves them. They help her fall asleep or calm down. She spits out the avent pacifiers. You can attach a pacifier-keeper clip to them by detaching the ring that comes standard with the Mam brand and just threading the ribbon/velcro through one of the holes in the soothie. At one point, she preferred these pacifiers over the breast when she was fussy and we realized that she had nipple confusion. Now we use them more sparingly only when she's surely not hungry and they work like a charm.
This is my favorite pacifier. I bought it when my baby was 3 months old. I love that my baby can better keep this in her mouth. Of course, sometimes she still grabs onto the lamb and pulls it out, but the design of this is such that it doesn't fall on the floor nearly as often. I find it most helpful in the car. I can tuck the lamb in the seatbelt straps to somewhat keep it in place, but it is still loose enough that she can pull it out if she really doesn't want it. I bought a second one (different animal). There are so many cute ones to choose from.
we recently purchased this simplicity camille crib.  it is beautiful.  i spent hours and hours on line looking for a nice looking crib that was in our price range.  this one fit the bill perfectly!!! most cribs of this type were much more expensive.  we are pleased with the quality, all pieces were there and assembly was easy.  it is a shade off white which was a plus for us as it matches our existing furniture.  another plus is that the side goes down.  so many of the new cribs do not have this feature.  it is a must for me as i am on the short side.
wife and i are having twins and decided to give this car seat a shot. we received them pretty fast (even though we live in fairbanks, ak). you can see that this is a good product right away. another reason why we chose this carseat is because it is lightweight. my wife is small and this being lightweight helps out a ton with her being able to carry them pretty easy. the click connect is really handy when you put 2 car seats in either the stroller and in the car. i will give a better update when the little ones arrive in a few weeks. but so far so good!
These pacifiers are great.  My daughter was exclusively breastfed, and was not given a pacifier until she was about 2-3 months old.  while it did take some time for her to get used to the pacifier, this was the only one she would take.  Eventhough they say 0-3 months, she is now 6 months, and continues to use it.  She has had no nipple confusion, and eventhough I try to get her to take other pacifiers, she will only suck on these.  It is great because they really help her settle down for her naps, and doesn't need them at any other time during the day.
we've been shopping for a nice play area for our crawling and cruising baby. this is perfect! the colors are nice and bold, so it makes it fun. it doesn't look like an animal cage, compared to others. it has a nice little play panel with a phone dial, and other things for a baby or toddler to play with, including a mirror. the material is a high quality, thick, smooth plastic, so babies can't hurt themselves by touching or grabbing the rails. it's also not easy to climb, so it serves its purpose by keeping infants and small toddlers safe in a play area.
i had to get a pump in order to return to work and still breastfeed my baby.  a family member and i went to babies r us to purchase the pump. after going back and forth over what the difference was in price on medela's, he found playtex on the shelf. after we noticed the price difference i decided to go with playtex since it seemed to offer the same quality as medela.  i was a little skeptical at first but once i got home and got into a routine i became pleased with the purchase. i would recommend this to anyone who's a working mother and breastfeeding.
Different babies like different pacifiers, so if these didn't work for some it doesn't mean they won't work for you. That being said, my baby isn't super picky about his pacifier. He will suck on Avents, Chiccos, and these. Both Orthopedic and Natural shaped. But, these are by far his favorite. I think he prefers the natural shape, but I also love these because they are flexible (no hard plastic which sometimes digs into his cheeks with others) and they are also just one formed piece, which is safer (no risk of the nipple coming off the plastic handle).
My daughter is in love with her pacifier and these are the only ones she'll take. We found them while on holiday to the US and bought what we thought was a good stock of them but now we're down to only 2!<br /> My problem with my order is that the size wasn't specified when I ordered and I was sent 0-6month pacifiers when I actually wanted the bigger type so she won't take these ones. So for me, it was a  waste of money sadly (lots of money because it was an international order and the shipping was expensive)<br />Not the fault of the seller, I must add.
My grandson just loves these pacifiers, and so do his parents and I. They don't get lost easily like the single ones and everyone wants to know where we got them. I have ordered many of these as they do eventually get raggedy and worn, or occasionally we do lose one, and have never been disappointed. Price may seem high but we feel they are definitely worth it. The items wash well, and there are many designs to choose from. We seem to prefer the giraffe because the long neck just seems to work better than a puppy or dinosaur, etc. Highly recommend these.
My son loves these pacifiers and has been using them since he was about 2 weeks old (he's 5 months now).     The handle is fun for baby: I always hand him his binky so he can grab the handle first. This way, he decides whether he wants to teethe the sides or suck on the nipple.     They wash well in the dishwasher and come out pristine. The construction is sturdy and, despite dire warnings in baby books, the individual pieces will not separate and become a choking hazard, not even if you tug on them very hard, not even after 100 rounds in the dishwasher.
i have to say that i am amazed at the ratings on this product.  i see sooo many people having problems, but for me, this has been one of the best purchases i have made.  i have purchased 4 different monitors and always got static and humming.  i wanted the video monitor to keep an eye on my \\climber\\.  i have had it for 4 months now and it works perfectly.  the picture is clear (even though the inside of her room is quite dark) and the sound is perfect.  i say, give the product a chance, the reviews very positive or very negative... give it a chance!!!
I just had my 3rd baby a couple of weeks ago and have been using these pacifiers since we were still in the hospital. My baby nurses like a pro and doesn't have any issues with latching on or any indication there might be a problem with nipple confusion. These pacifiers were the ones the lactation nurses liked too. I like these better than the original soothies because the shape doesn't appear to interfere with his breathing like I always feared the round pacifiers would with my other children. These are definitely the baby's preferred pacifiers as well.
We were given this pacifier at the hospital because my daughter didn't know how to suck when she was first born(she just chomped down which was pretty painful...). She took it right away and it was nice we could see the way she was sucking through the hole. At home we have about five different brands of pacifiers and this is still the only one she likes (though sometimes she will take a soothie). One nice thing that I love compared to the soothies is that the handle part has a hole in it so I can attach a pacifier holder thing that attaches to her shirt.
easy to assemble.  nothing works 100% of time but this works most of the time.  my baby loves the vibration, and this kind of rock itself if she's moving in it.  there's only 1 thing, i wish it was more of a hammock.  the plastic insert give my baby back support but she hates that she can't kick her legs straight that her weight keeps pushing her down.  but on most day when she's calm this works.  someone will probably call me a bad mom but i use this only when i'm sitting right next to her, --i put her on her side with an extra blanket to pad the bottom.
got this necklace for my incredibly cranky 6 month old. he was having a lot of trouble teething, and i was going on 2 weeks of not being able to set him down without him screaming. with in 3 hours of wearing this i noticed a difference. by the next day i was able to clean the entire kitchen, took about an hour, with him in his bouncer!!! the art of cure has incredible costumer service! i will be ordering another necklace for my 2 yr old, who is getting molars, from them!! i can't say enough good things about the product and seller! recommended to everyone
i bought the original version and the zipper never really worked, resulting in lots of failed attempts to make the zipper catch and plenty of dried out wipes. i contacted the company and was told  there was a new version addressing the zipper problem. they sent one out very quickly free of charge (great customer service). the new zipper is metal instead of plastic, and after a couple months, we've had no problems. i love being able to put this in the diaper bag instead of a huge bag of wipes or a clunky hard plastic case. i've found a new baby shower gift.
well-made quality back pack! i love that i can have all my hands free with baby and all the supplies!  and i love my husband can take it and pack it and not feel weird about carrying a woman's purse--which is what a lot of diaper bags look like now. the two zipped pockets on the inside are nice and roomy. i am a breast feeding mom, there are more than enough compartments for keys, nursing supplies, changing supplies, sunglasses, and extra clothes for my son. i really love it. the quality of the bag is well made, just like the baby carrier. i love them both.
i currently own the dreamlites bear for my baby girl and love it, but it does not play any sounds.  this was less expensive, much much cuter, and offers more functions than many others i had looked at buying.  she loves the soft sounds including the rain, heart beat, and nature all of which have three volume choices and an auto shut off feature.  it is very pretty in her room and just the right size.  it is soft to the touch but for the lights shell and is simply a great addition to her room and her bed time routine!  it is a perfect purchase.  we love it!!
this backpack is adorable, and although she hasn't started using it daily, it seems to me that the quality is great. i'll update review if that proves to be incorrect. the colours are really nice and the size is perfect for the matching lunch bag and a few workbooks to fit in. if you need much more than that to go in this wouldn't be a great option. it couldn't fit a full size binder from what i can tell. if you need to carry a full size file folder (8.5\\ x 11\\) then this is not a great option. it's rounded top makes it too small to hold that size of item.
this gate is amazing.  i have 3 of them set up in my home.  they are a little more difficult to install than the usual baby gate, but once it's done, they are wonderful.  i had other pressure gates that wore the wood down on the door casing so i had to keep readjusting so it would be tight enough, and then it would wear the casing down further.  with these gates, the presure holds the gate in place, but the swinging part of gate never touches the wood casing.  what a brilliant idea!  i would recommend this gate to anyone, not only for children, but pets too.
I love the Mam brand pacifiers and so does my daughter.  They seem to stay in longer at night and my daughter chews on them when shes teething.  One of my biggest challenges with pacifiers (other than losing them all the time) is trying to find them in the crib at night.  Granted, the glow wears off quite a bit during the night but you can generally see that dim glow enough to find it and get it back in their mouth.  A bomus is that my daughter is ansolutely fascinated by the glow.  Eleven dollars seems a bit pricey (as these are listed), I paid about seven.
We ordered these pacifiers for our little guy who was around 12 months at the time. He loves them! I really like the soft, gummy design and the way that you can see inside of them while they are in use. It's funny when he flips them around upside down. Due to the color pattern, it almost looks like he has a blue mustache :) I would definitely recommend these pacifiers to other moms/babies for the quality and design. They are great for older babies and young toddlers as they are designed for babies with teeth. Our son has 4 teeth right now so they're perfect.
we ordered the large diaper bag for our two children (age 22 months and 2 months). this has been super handy to have for all of our cloth diapers and cloth wipes. it's good for home use, but as we travel a lot it has been really helpful for use on the road. thus far, there has been no leaking and no odor from this bag. we previously purchased a smaller bag from this company which is more useful to hold wet clothes (only for 1 child for us) or a single cloth diaper. i would recommend this bag to anyone that is cloth diapering as it has made things way easier.
My 2 month old has been using these since day 4 when we needed extra help consoling her.  Unfortunately she loves it so much that it is difficult to have her nap without it, although she will go back to sleep after a night feed without it.  They do fall out easily so there are many trips back to her crib to reinsert the gumdrop but that is the sacrafice I make for getting her to sleep in the first place.  She doesn't wake up once she's in a deep enough sleep when it falls out.  I really like how it is shaped around her nose, giving her more space to breathe.
only had the seat a few days but so far so good. little girl loves her big girl seat- even fell asleep in it the first ride. her head did not fall forward and she seemed comfortable . really like the easy install and how the harness fits her. its also great that the harness is so easy to adjust- do not have to take it out of car so makes it easy to adjust around big heavy coats. have not had to wash cover yet but does not look like it will be too bad getting back on since it snaps. its not quite as soft as i thought it would be but she doesn't seem bothered.
this was a great buy!  i have been using this high chair for a year now and it's been sturdy, easy to use and most importantly easy to clean.  i just take the pad & straps off & throw in my washing machine.  the tray is easy to clean and hasn't gotten stained by sweet potatoes & marinara sauce like other trays i've had.  my daughter started using this at 7 months old and she fit just fine.  she's 19 months now and it's still not too tight on her.  i'm about ready to use it as a booster seat now so i love that it has dual functions as a high chair & a booster!
After reading an article about just how dirty enclosed pacifiers can get. Just chalk full of mold and other kinds of bacteria I knew I didn't want to use enclosed nipple pacifiers. After the first few days of using a wide nipple pacifier I switched to these. There seemed to be much less nipple confusion for my new baby. They are a little bit harder to hang onto for baby, but I really like these. Everyone loves how you can see their little tongue and lips sucking away~! I also appreciate the cut out for the nose. I don't like the Phillips ones for that reason!
bathing your baby is not the easiest task, especially if you are first time parents, you get nervous, and things might become really chaotic in seconds!<br /><br />this tiny duck does exactly what it is supposed to, in seconds. the color coding is amazing, and you know you are good to go if you just see the green light, cool down a bit if it's red, and add some hot water if you see the blue.and it's made out of really solid material, doesn't feel cheap as some other plastic things you find in stores these days.<br /><br />all in all, it's a very good product.
One of our favorites! This was a lifesaver in the early days with our baby - it's a cute toy that provides visual interest to the baby with the fun patterns, but it was also great because it would stay in place when the pacifier fell out of her mouth and she was usually able to get it back in on her own. Great for situations like driving when you can't get back there to replace a fallen pacifier! I give these as gifts to my friends now when they are expecting. I especially like the Mary Meyer series because they are a little cuter than the standard Wubbanubs.
i bought this for my 2 1/2 year old's toddler bed.  i really like the quality and construction.  it's warm, thick and soft and my toddler loves her new sheets.<br /><br />the background is bright white and they are a little thick and stiff out of the pretty packaging but they're wonderful after a wash.  apart from the organic line, i haven't seen any shrinkage in swaddledesigns products.  the colors and print match my other swaddledesigns products and i like that i can reuse her outgrown ultimate receiving blankets as top sheets.<br /><br />this is a good buy.
i love this high chair! it allows my youngest, a 1 year old, to sit up at the kitchen island with his siblings. he gets a good view of the cooking action and feels like part of the family rather than being in a high chair further away. i was afraid it might not support his weight but it is incredibly sturdy and there is plenty of room for him to grow into it. it is very easy to clean. i plan on keeping this for years beyond my children's use. as it could come in very handy if friends or family members visit with little ones. i am very happy with this purchase.
Our DD is no longer using pacifiers but this is the one I recommend and will always use for future kiddos.  Interestingly, the nature of this pacifier lended itself to our daughter weaning off the pacifier a little after 12 months.  She had had her last pacifier long enough to colapse the bulb flat and since it didn't seem she was ready to give it up, I decided I better replace it.  Apparently, she didn't like the new and preferred the old deflated pacifier better.  So, after playing around and chewing on it for a week or two, I hid it and she forgot about it.
i did not prepare at all for breastfeeding when i got ready to have my first child in june and suddenly, when she arrived, i realized that to nurse effectively, it would make sense to learn a little bit about the topic!  this book was an amazing guide to teach me about the benefits of nursing, how to do it, how to attend to all the challenges and how to make the most of it.  nursing has been one of the best experiences of being a new mom and this book helped me to enjoy the experience beyond all expectations.  thorough, detailed and clear.  highly recommended!
Our baby loves the binky and therefore we always travel with one. Somehow we constantly lose them. This WubbaNub is the perfect solution. It's easy for him to navigate into his mouth and we never lose sight of it. He even finds it in the dark to stuff back into his mouth when he's half awake. They come in different animal shapes too. Love it!<br /><br />If you're looking for some advice on other baby registry essentials, check out AllMomsArePerfect dot com.

I ordered this Wubbanub pacifier for our daughter who is due in a few weeks. I was excited about it, because it is so much different than the ones they sell in stores. It seems like around where I live they only sell pacifiers that look little boy-ish (Green Frog and Red Dog). So when I saw this I knew our daughter needed it! When it arrived I was so pleased. It is so much cuter in person than the picture (and I thought it was adorable in the picture). I am very pleased with this purchase and would definitely recommend it to others with/expecting a little girl.
i absolutely love these towel hoodies! what is better than a one of a kind and personalized hand made towel hoodie for your little one?! these hoodies are so comfortable and durable- i have washed it and still the quality holds up! i love giving my 1 year old a bath and wrapping her up in these towel hoodies after- it's soft on her skin and is big enough to wrap her up in it! the quality of these hoodies are amazing and they also make an awesome gift! melissa really has found her nitch- i would encourage everyone to buy one of these. it is well worth the money!
Different than the one piece Avent Soothie newborn pacifiers, this pair of two new little pacifiers resemble more grown up models but they are just the right size for a newborn. It was a pleasant surprise to see the included clear covers which I hope we don't misplace.  I have been very happy with the Avent pacifiers for their design and durability and was happy to see this new entry inot the collection. They are priced right, and we always have extras on standby, knowing how important they are for baby and all other concerned family members when baby needs it.
I have gone through so many nooks with my son throughout the last 7 months. These are the only ones that stay in his mouth and he loves it. He will actually whine for the nook alot! I had problems with other nooks sitting funny on his face or going up his nose, not with this one.I love that it allows his skin and face to breathe. It will definitely be hard to break the habit. I call it the emergency button. All I have to do is hand him this MAM nook when he's crying and instantly he stops. I am so thankful and highly recommend it. Easy to wash, dishwasher safe!
We received all brands of pacifiers from friends and family at our baby shower.  They must have known something that we did not!  My parents never used pacifiers with me or any of my siblings, so I wasn't completely convinced of their necessity UNTIL we discovered that we have a colicky baby!  We are now masters of the 5 S's: swing, swaddle, shhh, stomach/side, and SUCK.  Consequently, we've tried all the different pacifiers that we were given,and the ONLY ones that our baby consistently accepts are the GumDrop pacifiers.  We would all be miserable without them!
works great! when i first received the bibs i thought that it was weird that the bib is a little curved. but it worked out well since the baby's chest is not flat. my 22-month old did not object to the new bib as she's only used fabric bib up till now. it's great for pasta with tomato sauce nights and soups as she likes to pick up the whole bowl and drink her soup that way. the bib keeps her clothing much cleaner than fabric ones. it's also easy cleaned and air dries easily (or towel dry if you prefer). good for travel as you really just need one or two per kid.
very cute blankets and great for swaddling in warm weather. our baby won't sleep unless he is swaddled but the weather has been so hot that our house gets to 80 degrees even with the air conditioner on!  with these blankets we can still swaddle him when it's warm and he can sleep well without us worrying about him overheating.  they are nice and big too, much better for swaddling than all of our other blankets.  my only complaint is that they are pretty expensive for basically big pieces of muslin fabric but we have definitely gotten our moneys worth this summer.
i love this bag.  it is big enough to hold everything i need but not super bulky.  i chose this bag because of the optional backpack feature (as opposed to the boxy always having the straps out) and use it frequently. i had a jj cole bag before this one and could never get it closed and worried about things falling out.  the only annoying thing with this bag is that when you are wearing it as a backpack the front pocket is easily accessible.  i keep my phone and wallet in the pocket where the straps go so that they aren't there for the taking of anyone behind me.
this bottle has been wonderful for my breast fed baby. when i give my son this bottle the sucking motion is uncanning to nursing at the breast. he loves to drink water from it & play with it! it's kinda like a passifier substite for us being that i've never given him a pasifier. i can push the air out & put cap on & its ready to go stright in his mouth when i take cap off, haven't had any leaking problems. we used regular bottles @ 1st he seemed to drink quickly & spit his milk up, this is a problem of the past. i definitely recommend breastfeeding & this bottle!
i love these bottles for my 2 year old daughter.  the shatter-proof bottle has taken quite a beating and the straws are well designed and great quality.  i've purchased several of these and they quickly became our bottle of choice.  they're not totally leak-proof, especially if you leave the flip top open, but if they do spill, it's very little.  the only improvement i would recommend for this bottle is to make the strap removable.  it washes fine in the top rack of the dishwasher, but the strap stays wet for quite a bit after you take them out of the dishwasher.
this was an amazing raincoat for the price. i bought this one for my 3 year old son and a ladybug one for my 4 year old daughter. they did fit a little big, but i thought it was really nice the way they hung well below the knee for added protection in the rain. the quality is good, and after using them repeatedly, i can see them lasting for years to come. i also bought the matching rain boots and umbrellas and both of my kids were very exited to wear them. in the spring when it's raining every day, it's so nice to see them excited to get dressed up and go outside.
This is the most adorable little creature!  My baby is actually a Nuk fan, but she will take the Soothie from time to time, especially when her sweet lamb is attached!  It has been a great way to help her keep the pacifier in her mouth, and she loves to hold the lamb while it's on her chest.  I'm just so disappointed that the lamb is currently unavailable.  I've searched several times for it for recently born babies, but no luck.  We haven't had any issues with the pacifier falling off, or the lamb getting dirty. I think it would hold up to a good washing, though.
Some babies can be so fussy about pacifiers, but my baby never refused one of these.  She uses Playtex pacifiers everyday.<br /><br />At daycare she has this one with a handle because they hang them up on a little hook when she's not napping.<br />At night I kind of prefer the ones without the handle...cuz she can tend to play around with it, dangle it out of her crib, etc.<br /><br />Nice to have both options in my opinion, and plus you'll need at least 4 in rotation...there's always one missing, in the other room, hiding underneath the crib, in the carseat, etc.
i purchased this pump bra with my first child. it was a lifesaver! i pumped for a full year and used this every time. i am now 6 months in using it for my second child. there are no tears in it, and it has held its shape despite daily use and washings. i can't recommend this item enough! i didn't want to have to change bras every time i pumped and this fits over a nursing bra. i did buy it a size larger than what the chart read for my build to be sure it fit long term. it is adjustable so you can make it fit from the early days of pumping through the later months.
I've used several types and brands of diapers and these are the ones I come back to every time. They are simple, good quality and you can't beat the price.  I reach for these prefolds and covers first.  The cover fits trim, is soft, pliable and thin so it is not as hot in warmer weather as others.  When baby gets older, you fold the prefold long ways and it is skinnier through the legs making walking and getting around easier without bulk.  They absorb very well.  I wish I'd bought these first instead of spending money on other, more expensive systems.  LOVE THESE!
These are AMAZING.  I love so many things about these pacifiers...First, they're all natural and BPA free.  They're also one solid piece.  There's no soapy water getting stuck inside the pacifier.  These are also GREAT for teething.  My son will take the pacifier out of his mouth throughout the night, gum and chew all over the pacifier and he never makes a peep.  They're extremely soothing.  They are bouncy, though!  We've gone through many because we lose them!  Save yourself the hassle of using other, hard plastic, pacifiers...just buy these!!!!  They're AMAZING.
i love the convenience of just zipping the sheet on and off as needed.  i am over 50 and raising my grandson for a little bit.  i am short and can barely reach over the side of the crib so the ability to just replace the part of the sheet that is being slept on, compared to wrestling with the entire mattress, is a big help.  the sheets wash up nicely.  i do take the mattress out at least once a month to wash the entire sheet that sits under the mattress, that's when i rotate the mattress or turn it over.  so easy to manage.  yes, i would recommend this to a friend.
This is our 4th WubbaNub.  These are awesome pacifiers for babies who prefer the Soothie-brand pacifier.  They don't fall out of the crib and are quite cute dangling from baby's mouth.  For new parents contemplating this item, buy 2 at a time:  one for current use when the other is in the wash because it got spaghetti sauce on it or fell on a dirty floor!  It is important to note, too, as other reviews have mentioned, the pacifier does not detach from the stuffed animal.  The pacifier is sewn to the animal and can easily be thrown in the laundry and then air-dried.
i'm shocked how many granola mommies told me to get a wipe warmer. i would have thought of all gimmicky products this was one you could do without. but, it has been a nice experience for my newborn. and, from what i understand as they get older a warm wipe especially at night time changing is a must to keep a fussy baby from reacting to a cold wipe.<br /><br />i use my own homemade cloth wipes rolled up. for the recipe i add 4cups water, 1 tsp. vitamin e oil, 1 tsp. castille soap, 10 drops lavender essential oil with 50 homemade 7&#34;x7&#34; cotton flannel squares.
This was the pacifier used at the hospital so the twins have been used to them since birth. I like that it does not squish their nose. Soft, flexible material. Easy to clean. Good price point....I probably have 10 at this point because I go through several a day with twins and this way I don't keep playing &#34;find the pacifier&#34;. Make sure you note the sizes on the package, because with each size, the harder the rubber is and my babies definitely noticed the difference. To the point where they don't like the green ones (3-6 m) even though they are 4 months old.
This is the best idea ever, my son is 4 months old and he loves his pacifier but still so small and has a hard time keeping it in his mouth, but with this nifty thing he keeps it in his mouth. When I would be riding in the front seat I would have to reach my arm into the back seat and hold the pacifier in his mouth almost the whole ride by the time we reached our destination I couldn't feel my arm. Now I just lay one of these on his chest and even if he falls asleep it doesn't fall out of his mouth so if he starts trying to suck again it's still right there for him.
my daughter has had this over 2 years and still plays with it (well, it comes and goes in the toy hierarchy, but she does come back to it frequently).  good way to work through colors and textures - - was a challenge at first and took her a while to get through them all, but that's a good thing.  now that she is a pro with it, she puts them together quickly and then makes a &#34;road&#34; out of them, or mixes them and makes stories - they are taking on a new life beyond their original purpose.  that's the mark of a good toy.  i've given these as birthday gifts too.
why didn't i know about this earlier? i saw this in a baby store and thought it was a great idea. my six month old wasn't sitting up on her own yet and i was needing to start bathing her with her sister to save time. this allowed her to sit up and play in the water. it took up about 1/3 of our tub which allowed her sister the rest of the tub to play in. it's super soft.<br /><br />this item is rather heavy when wet. we let it sit in the tub after it completing drains and then hang it up. also, if you fill the tub too high, it kinda floats and ends up as a baby boat!
i love avent bottles; however, instead of using these bottles, we use the new ones. we have the four ounce bottles that are blue for our son. they are so cute and so convenient. he loves them and they are so easy for him to drink out of that he is able to get every drop of formula out of the bottle. since i was never able to produce enough milk while breastfeeding, these bottles were a great transition from breast to bottle not only that but we had to use these bottles when we supplemented during breastfeeding and my son had no nipple confusion whatsoever! great buy.
this is a nice size bag that we have been using for wet swim clothes.  we don't always go home immediately after swim lessons, and the bag has kept the wetness from the swim clothes from getting onto anything else in the diaper bag.<br /><br />i haven't used it for dirty diapers, so can't comment as to whether it contains that smell, but it does seem to contain the chlorine smell from the pool.<br /><br />usually we just air dry the bag, but it has been through the wash once without a problem.  seems to be a high quality bag that should last us as long as we need it.
we love this soft and absorbent bath wrap! 3 of my kids (7, 4 and 2 years old) own these bath wraps and they love them so much! my son, who is 7, loves the fact that he just steps out of the shower, puts the wrap on, walks to his room, and he is quickly dried off. he noticed that this bath wrap absorbed much quicker than his previous wrap from a different company. i love the soft feel of the robes and enjoy how the kids don't complain about being cold when wearing it like they usually do with their regular towels. i recommend this item, which would make a great gift!
I had originally received this as a gift for one of my twins however after them arriving at 34weeks (6weeks) early I was conserned that it would be two big for her. However this is a little on the small side witch worked out perfectly because after being born the smallest of the two got down two 3 lbs. Also the nicu nurses love the convineance of being able to find the binky right away and that is light weight so they don't worry about it causing her any harm. Over all we love our wubbanubs!!!:) and would recomend to anyone and truely is the perfect baby shower gift!
I bought this for my 4 month old as he had trouble maneuvering his regular pacifier.<br /><br />I am quite impressed at how well made the overall product is made. The monkey is soft and with beans in the hands and feet. The pacifier, which is a Soothie, the same kind they give you in hospitals, is very securely attached. I've tugged on it and have no concerns about it coming off.<br /><br />As I it comes with a Soothie, which is Monkey's favourite, he took to it right away. There was a slight learning curve in getting him used to it, but he quickly got the hang of it.
these are the only pacifiers my daughter likes at the moment.  I like the different colors they sell too.  Im not into pink much, so my daughter doesnt wear a lot of pink, mostly neutrals or purple.  She gets called a boy often but with these pacifiers now she doesnt.  haha.  my only problem with these is that because they dont have an open handle like most pacifiers do, you have to be careful what paicfier clip to buy, because some are thick and meant to be used on the hard plastic pacis.  but luckily they make paci holders that have a small string to just draw thru.
We received a pacifier at the hospital that our son loved and didn't seem to cause nipple confusion. These seem to the same brand and we bought quite a few of them. Our son at 6 months still loves them and now likes to chew on the sides. They are a good size and the baby can handle and hold them well. One thing to note when they fall they are like super balls and settle in the toughest area to reach. It becomes a bit of a game Where did the Pacifier Go?  The packaging says 0 to 6 months and we are now looking for a replacement. I am not sure we really need one though.
Great newborn pacifier that worked well for our son when he was one month old (he was three weeks early). Up to that point we had used the Gum Drop or Soothies, which calmed him, but I had to sit in the back seat of the car and hold them in his mouth. These pacifiers were the answer to that! The size was perfect and he could keep them in his mouth easily. I was also happily surprised that the pattern was much cuter than the picture and the color was a neutral tan. We have since bought them in other sizes and will continue to use these as long as our son has a pacifier.
Our hospital gave us the Philips Avent Pacifier, which is the only pacifier our child will take.<br /><br />However, she had an issue with keeping it in her mouth, so we bought the WubbaNub. This attaches to the binky and acts as a counter weight when your baby decides to take a break from sucking. The benefit is that it doesn't fall out of your childs mouth, and doesn't require constant repositioning.<br /><br />The other bonus is that it gives the momma a break from breastfeeding. Coming from a new father and mother, this is a product definitely worth the investment.
love this potty. it's so easy to use and it's really cute. the size is good too, smaller then some i've seen and smaller then our other one but i like that better. it has a good pee guard for boys too, although for my son it seemed like he would always shoot pee up and over the guard. it's just a part of boy life i think that you have to teach them to hold their junk down while they are peeing lol that took care of that. he's almost 4 so now he uses the regular toilet except he has this upstairs in case he has to pee at night. easy to clean and still looks new actually
wow, now this is a nice seat. after searching store after store for a quality booster, i finally decided to order the britax parkway sgl online since no store around me carried it. this seat latches in securely and the back of the seat is locked in and not going anywhere. my wife bought a couple of cheap graco seats for her car and am always annoyed how they fall apart when you take them out and slide around when no kids are in them. really cool how the back of this seat slides in and will not fall apart when moving. padding is superior to other seats i have looked at.
this mirror is great! my husband and i bought two other mirrors but because the headrest in my suv does not move we could not find one that worked, until i found this one. i just had to snake the strap between the top of the seat and the headrest. the other mirrors we bought didnt fit around the headrest and required the headrest to rise in order for it to be secured. the daffadooy mirror itself is huge and clear and angles perfectly, making it much safer to look at  my little guy. i think the only thing i wish it had was a light for at night, like the brica mirror has.
We love our froggie Wubanub! It is so cute but beyond that it is so functional! It does not bounce or roll into the great beyond when dropped or spit out. It is easy to find in a paci emergency! Our little guy could hold it with his arm weeks before his mother skills developed enough to let him use his hand for the task. We get compliments and questions whenever we go out (froggie is always with us!) I always recommend Wubanub to my mommy and grand parent friends. The only issue would be if your little one does not like the Soothie pacis but mine loves it so no problem.
we noticed our 2.5 year old daughter using a stuff animal as a pillow so i ordered her this a few weeks ago.<br /><br />it was more money than i wanted to spend but it is perfect and totally worth the money.<br /><br />sure, you can get a $5 pillow the same size at target but that one is lumpy and has no pillow case.  and good luck trying to find a pillow case for that size!<br /><br />this one is nice and firm which allows it to stay in place on the bed.  the pillow case is the same material as her pottery barn kids chamois sheet and she loves it.<br /><br />great buy!
so light.  easy to maneuver.  registered for and received a travel system with my first child 5 years ago.  it was big and bulky, the fabric was terrible and tore easily. nonetheless less it didn't last.  a very good friend gave me her chicco carrier that was barely used and since i have other strollers from my 5 yr old i just needed something to cart my newborn around in for the first several months.  this was the perfect fit.  it folds up to be a fraction of the width as any typical travel system stroller.  did i mention that it is really light? and really easy to use?
These have saved our sanity. I bought these after they were recommended by a friend and I received a single pack at my baby shower. I've since purchased several because we are always losing them or dropping them and we MUST have one on hand for our little guy. These are very soothing to him and not too big for his mouth. He has been using them since he was 1 month old and is now almost 11 weeks- still loves them. They are cute and neutral blue and green- could really be used for a boy or girl. The best part is that they are orthodontic so they won't cause him any damage.
I bought pack n plays to use while camping and was afraid that my twin boys wouldn't not sleep well in them since they are used to sleeping in a crib. I bought this mattress to use since they would sleep in their pack n play for a week at a time. When I first opened the box I was afraid they were to soft. But once I laid my son down on it, it did not sag or give in so I was not afraid to use it on my 4 month old twins. In fact they slept better on this mattress than they do at home. I ended up buying 2 of these for both boys and for the price I am happy with my purchase.
love this booster. i was a little worried after reading about installation problems, but got it anyway. i have two britax boulevards and love them. it was a little tricky to install, but once i figured out you have to thread the tightening straps through the holes in the seat part of the car seat and pull to tighten, they tightened just fine. i used the latch installation. it is pretty solid. the 5-point harness is to easy to buckle, my 5 year old daughter can do it herself. i love having the added security of the 5-point harness and the side impact protection. go britax!
This is the only pacifier my breastfed daughter will accept.<br /><br />I like the design. It's slightly curved so that it contours to her mouth. It does not have a up or down side (like the Nuk paci) which makes it easier for me to place it in her mouth and it's easier for her to put it back in her mouth as well. There is a protective cap that covers the nipple of the nipple, which is nice because I can just throw one in my bag and not worry about it getting gross.<br />You can sterilize these as needed. I just pop them in a microwave steam bag with my breast pump parts.
I got the green!  It really is cut and I love it.  No patterns/cartoon characters.  I almost got the black and I'm so glad  didn't!  Chair is easy to fold/unfold although it is quite bulky.  Wipes clean.  The tray is not adjustable as others have mentioned, but that's not really a big deal for me.  Babies are messy so no matter how the tray fits, they're still going to drop stuff.  My baby is 8.5 months old about 16lbs, so she's pretty small.  So, I don't need to swing the tray open to put her in, yet.  There's plenty of room to climb out/stand, so be sure to strap 'em in!
this giraffe is my son's favorite toy so i had to write a review.  he is 12 weeks old now and just loves to bat at the four different toys hanging from the giraffe's legs.  each toy provides a different sensory experience - it is educational and keeps him interested.  my son has now started to grab the rings and the other toys and he trys to put them in his mouth.  he also loves to look at the giraffe's face and the spots on his body.  he never bores of this giraffe - it makes him so happy!  really this is just a great toy i recommend it over others of a similar character.
this video monitor is the best out there.  it is perfectly clear day/night.  since it is 100% digital your connection is safe, and there is no fuzziness with the sound or video.  another nice feature about this monitor is that you can buy additional cameras so that you don't have to move it all over the house to wherever your child is.  you can also zoom in to see a more detailed picture of your child, and it is also able to pan around the room.  what a relief to find a video monitor that has a safe secure connection with no  sound problems.  i absolutely love this product!
we have two kids, and have gone through 5 or 6 different baby monitors, before finally getting this one. the others were all analog, and cheap, and had a lot of problems with static, range etc.<br />this monitor works great - there is no static whatsoever, and it easily covers our entire 4 bedroom house and the yard. another neat little feature, which my 3.5 year old son likes a lot is the two-way radio capability, which i use every morning when he wakes up to acknowledge his presence, and he cracks himself up.<br />5 stars, don't waste time and money with cheaper products.
i did a lot of research before buying this carrier. i have a bad back and was worried about having an uncomfortable carrier. i haven't quite got the positioning of my 6 week old perfected and sometimes he doesn't enjoy it (i think because of the positioning (once he had his nose against my chest and couldn't breathe and got really upset)), but the carrier is very comfortable and once he gets a little bigger (he was a 5 1/2 pound baby), i think it will work really well. i would recommend this carrier but just to be careful that a baby's nose is not pressed against your chest.
i love this stroller. you can change the canopy to a different color which is really nice.  i don't have to by a new stroller every time i want to get a different look.  the 360 degree spin feature is perfect.  it makes strolling so much easier. i don't have to pull my baby out every time i want to see him.  the bassinet is really nice since you can't use most strollers until 6 months.  you get more use out of this stroller.  the look is very pretty. it seems a little heavier but to me it makes it feel like it is more durable than some of the cheap other strollers out there.
love these diaper covers! i have four other thirsties duo wraps, 3 of them are also hook & loop. we prefer the hook and loop, it's easier to get a good fit on my chubby thighed baby. the velcro is very strong on these. i've only been cloth diapering for about 5 months, and i wash every 2-3 days and they have held up great so far. it seems like the velcro will last for a long time. i use these over prefolds during the day, and over fitted diapers at night. my son is a chunky 23 lb 6 month old and he's wearing size 2 on the smallest setting, so these should fit for a long time!
i remember looking at this product when i was filling out my baby registry and puking in my mouth a bit at the thought of a &#34;snot sucker.&#34;  fast forward a few months. life has changed forever, and i have been eating my words every day.  i love this thing.  it works about 10x better than the hospital bulb we had been using. :our baby is not a fan of either, but he sounds much less congested and happier after this option. super easy to piece apart and clean, and there have been no disgusting breaches of the filter.  i wouldn't recommend trying this in public, though. ;)
We got this for our boy at birth, and within a few weeks, he could hug it to himself.  So, it was about 50 times less often that we'd have to reach over and adjust his pacifier.  The beads inside help to keep Wubba on our son's chest, even when he was very little, further reducing the amount of retrieval we had to do.  That adds up, and you can count it in whatever sanity is measured by.  The monkey is cute and soft, but very durable.  Whenever he gets grungy, he just goes in the wash with normal clothing.  I LOVE this product so much I got the Giraffe to leave at the in-laws.
this diaper changer is great. we use it &#34;on the go&#34; but also around the house all the time.<br /><br />the pad is very big, so the baby is really comfortable and we'll be able to use it for a long time. i really like the little bags that came with it, really useful to dispose of the dirty diaper.<br /><br />i bought it for my husband, thinking that he will need a discrete diaper changer and not one pink or something like that, it turns out it is very discrete but i also love it and use it all the time!<br /><br />i'm really happy with this purchase. highly recommended.
i wasn't sure about getting a &#34;space saver&#34; high chair, but this one is great! it has a rubber track on the bottom and two straps, enabling it to be very securely attached to a chair.  it can recline for a baby who is not quite able to sit up yet and has a center &#34;post&#34; to keep a child from sliding down.  the deluxe version now has wipeable straps and the cover is washable and wipeable too.  the tray and the tray insert can go in the dishwasher.  i like the seat cover--it's cute without being too cutesy and is very unisex.  would definitely purchase this again.
these really work. at around 7 months, our daughter had started sleeping through the night really well, except that meant she would pee through her diaper every night (and sometimes wake up wet, sometimes sleep through wet clothes), so i got these, and now she sleeps through the night without leaking! she hates being wet, so she sometimes still wakes for us to change it, but it doesn't get out of the diaper, and she goes right back down after we put on another one of these. besides these, we only use the &#34;natural&#34; brands of diapers, but it was so worth it to get these.
What a great product. We started using this when my baby was 3 weeks old (he's now 7 weeks old) and couldn't keep the pacifier in his mouth, no it will not completely keep it from falling off, if baby doesn't want it he definitely spits it out, but it does helps the pacifier to stay in. One thing I loved about this is the fact that we can stick the arms of the little bear through the straps in his car seat (between baby's chest and the straps) and it holds it perfectly in place for the car ride, so I don't have to keep reaching back to put the pacifier back in my baby's mouth.
WubbaNubs are a genius idea! I wish I'd thought of it! And so cute! We have the elephant and the giraffe, and between the two they have saved hours of my searching under sofas and chairs for stray soothies! As soon as they arrived in the mail the soothies from the hospital when right into a drawer and have stayed there! Now that my little one is older he loves to use the soothie sideways as a teething toy, which he absolutely favors over all the other fancy teething toys I've purchased! Now if only they made some more fun animals, like a turtle or a fish, I've have a lot more!
we use cloth 90% of the time. it really isn't as bad as everyone makes it out to be. her skin looks amazing! no rashes. ever. these covers are amazing. they have a flap on each end that holds the cloth diaper in, no need for pinning at all. i have tried about 10 different types/brands and this is the easiest one for us. as long as the cover doesn't get gross you only have to change the insert. we have one set of the flip over night inserts. they are lovely but expensive. we use a cheaper prefold and they work perfectly. we plan on giving a cover to each pregnant mommy we know.
My granddaughter was very fussy when not being held, i bought this in hopes it would help her keep a pacifier in.  it worked beautifully.  she is such a happier, more content child now being able to self-soothe with this pacifier that stays put because of the stuffed animal. she loves to hug it while she sleeps as well.  she is too young to grab normal pacifiers and put them in her mouth when they fall out, but this one says right outside her mouth when she relaxes and lets go our she moves.....very easy for her to put it back in. i would def buy another wubbanub in the future.
My coworker called these things baby crack and said that if your baby's given these pacifiers in the hospital, she's reject all others.  My coworker was right!  My baby absolutely loves these, and rejects all other pacifiers.<br /><br />I gave this 5 stars because, as the mother of a colicky baby, anything that calms her down is a godsend.  One thing I don't love about them is if you drop them, they both bounce and roll.  Doesn't sound like a big deal until youre crawling around on the floor at 3 am with a wailing baby in one arm, praying the thing didn't roll behind the couch.
Our son was born in April of 2010 and LOVEs these binkies (what we call them)...he won't take any other brand, trust me I tried.  The others just seem to gag him.  I breastfeed him and we don't have any issues with nipple confusion and never had a nursing strike.  He does take bottles of breastmilk but only from time to time.  These are the binkies the hospitals hand out when you give birth and I love them.  DS#1 never took a binkie so we weren't sure what to use for our new son but these have been a godsend in the car and for times when he just wants to be cuddled but not eat.
we received this as a gift to use with the uppababy bassinet.  it was super easy to put together (i did it myself without help from the husband!) and it looks exactly like the photo.  it's slightly larger than the bassinet itself, which we knew from the measurements listed, but the bassinet stays in it securely.  we love the rocking feature, which was a major reason that we decided to get this instead of the uppababy brand.  it is a bit shorter than other bassinet stands, but again, we knew this from the description and for the price you can't beat it.  we can't wait to use it!
My baby loved her frog and now her Dragon. We took them both to the Houston Renaissance Festival and everyone loved it!<br /><br />Well made and exactly the colors shown. It is easy for her to grab the little feet and is easy to find at night when you are randomly groping in a crib for a pacifier. If you feel the soft happiness, it's your wubbanub. It's small enough that I don't have to worry about it smothering her and perfect for travel. Way easier to find than a normal pacifier.<br /><br />I love them so much, I am getting them for my friends with small babies for Christmas.
i bought this item for a new grandmother. i read a lot of reviews before i purchased it. a lot of customers stated that they waned to get a second. the bag is designed very well. i think i am going to get one for myself as i am away from home a lot. the inside has large & deep pockets on either side. in addition, there is one main compartment in the center. the changing pad leaves a lot to be desired but i purchased another one separately. this bag is so versatile that i really did not care about the changing pad. i stuffed the bag with various items before giving it as a gift.
The Munchkin website only illustrates this quick install gate for doors, but I bought it as a solution for a window and it works great.  The honeycomb plastic lets air pass thru and keeps toddlers from pushing against the window screen and falling out.  I can tell you that this is very secure if installed on the interior window jam.  My window still is able to slide up and down without interference from the gate.  It can also be removed in seconds if needed to use the window as a fire escape.  The seller on my gate was shipped and sold by Amazon LLC, and shipping was very quick.
i bought this bed for my daughter when she was 18mo, she is now 3 and still using it. she loves to jump on the bed (despite me telling her not to) and this has stood up to it like a champ. i put it together by myself while i was pregnant with twins, no problems at all. now that the twins are getting big i ordered another one and the oldest will hand hers down so she can get a big girl bed and the twins will have matching toddler beds. honestly, the 3 year old could probably use this toddler bed for at least another year or two if she were not handing it down to one if the twins.
best money we've spent on the kid. he doesn't like his bassinet so much; i think it's a bit too big and open for him, he seems to like the coziness, gentle rocking and the incline offered by the rnp. it's really a nice little travel bed for him, too, and easy to fold/carry. it would be even better if it had a shoulder strap, but, whatever. the first two nights he was home he was really fussy and barely slept (after six weeks in the nicu on an inclined bed). the third night, we opened this package and put him in the rocker--he was out for like four hours. get one. you'll love it.
i have sold this product on my website.  i have also used this product for my own children.  my husband is on the medical field and has spoken to the inventor.  it has indirect airflow so it will not harm your child.  we used saline spray first to loosen the mucus.  small children cannot blow their nose, therefore sinus issues can easily turn into a chest cold from post nasal drip.  this product will help keep sinuses clear. in all honesty, it seems like a strange product, but it is probably the best gadget i ever had for my kids.  100% approve!  very helpful tool for parents!!!!
we recently transitioned our daughter to a toddler bed this is the only rail that really fits safely on her convertible crib (the same model as this rail, purchased from target). you have to have the piece of wood that comes with the crib to use this as it screw in very securely to the bed frame. our daughter now sleeps on the edge of the bed, right near this rail, and it barely gives at all, making us feel that she is safe and unlikely to fall out of bed! it does only cover less than half of the length of the bed, but if the child doesn't roll around too much they should be fine!
typically this is for babies,but as a post cancer patient, i occasionally get a sore jaw and teeth. i decided to try it out and see if it would help any at all. it did. it took awhile for me, but yes it works for adults too. i have always believed in the value of stones and their properties. amber is one of the best  there is. i give it 5 stars and now that i have met someone that has a baby i will be passing it along. thanks powells owls for making this!!!<br /><br />i received these for free in consideration of a product review. however, my opinions are my own and no one else's.
The paci given at the hospital was the only one our son would take.   This wubbanub has the paci just like the hospitals.  It's just heavy enough to stay in place so you aren't constantly having to put the paci back in your infant's mouth.  Then, when your baby is old enough they can hold on to the wubbanub's ears or paws and put it in their mouth all by themselves.  Great for them to carry around when they are older and most importantly the paci is big enough that when dropped it never rolls away - we never lost one!  We bought three.  toss in washer.  It's a perfect shower gift.
We got this at the reccomendation of a Doctor in the PICU.  Our baby boy was always spitting out his paci on accident, or as a game.  The Wubbanub is the best thing since a bouncy seat.  The toy gives him something to hug while sucking his paci,and the added weight of the bear helps keeps the paci in his mouth.  And if the Paci drops it will not roll under furniture (Never good to have a screaming baby while parents are on hands and knees surching frantically for the paci).  I am thinking about getting another just to have a spare on hand because he is gonna love this one to bits.
i bought these pacifiers before my daughter was born, simply because i thought they were cute.  these pacifiers stay in her mouth better than any others we'ver tried and she loves them!  we've tried other brands and she spits them out or can't hang on to them as well, but as soon as we give her one of these pacifiers, she calms down quickly.  however, i would definitely make sure that you buy the \\knob\\ kind.  she does have difficulty hanging on to the nipple on the one that has the handle on the pacifier (the kind that isn't the \\knob\\ pacifier).  we love these pacifiers!!!!!!
this is a must have! my baby is restless and this baby swaddler was a life saver! my baby actually wants to be swaddled, it makes her feel all cozy like she was in the womb. when she is feeling a little stressed out, i just wrap her in this and she calms right down and falls asleep. one recommendation is to make sure the velcro is covered before washing as it make snag other fabrics. also, i didn't know this before, but the little slot in the booty are is for a car seat or swing buckle, so your little one can be snug as a bug but still safe in their seat. definitely recommend this.
I think the Avent soothie is a God send.  It works like no other paci out there, so when you add a cute little &#34;stuffed animal&#34; to the end of it, who can resist??  My son wouldn't take to any other paci, but this one works like a charm, and he's now learning to hold onto the legs.  SO cute!<br /><br />Like many people know, 2012 was the year of the Golden Dragon (not just any Dragon year), one that comes every 60 years, so I had to have this paci.  I'm pretty sure the manufacturers knew this, because it can't be a coincident that it was the most expensive WubbaNub (can it?).
my 6-year-old daughter really wanted to stop sucking her thumb, and asked me to order the pink thumbuster for her.  she was very excited when the product came, and she wore it without any complaint.  there was no chafing or other issue.  after going her first night ever without sucking her thumb, her confidence was raised enough that she felt she didn't need the thumbuster anymore.  she kept wearing it for a few more days at my insistence, but when she forgot to put it back on after washing her hands for dinner she went the whole night without the thumbuster... or sucking her thumb!
this is a great monitor.  i bought this after spending a lot of time researching video monitors, and it received the best reviews on amazon.  the battery life is not as long as i would like, but its only a slight inconvience.<br />i recently contacted customer service regarding an issue, and i received a reply from mae, the customer service manager, within an hour.  she answered my question and provided additional information which was very helpful.  i was very impressed with mae, and appreciate a company that values their customers.  i would highly recommend infant optics products!
bought this for our son, who has the habit of kicking away his blanket with surprising precision - a problem when temperature falls in the house during this time of the year.<br />while it is, of course, entirely random whether a child will accept a sleeping bag (or wearable blanket), we lucked out and he did not reject it. in fact, he likes it and gets unhappy when you remove it in the morning.<br /><br />the product 100% cotton as advertised, easily washable and doesn't get too hot. the zippers work without getting stuck.<br /><br />short: product works. baby happy, parents happy.
pros: simple and fun, unique, cheap, works as a portable speaker for an mp3 player  cons: not incredibly high quality, i can see the novelty wearing off after a while  i got this as a gift for my brother who loves music and plays piano and a few other instruments.  it was great watching him go from confusion to delight as he figured out what this thing was.  a few minutes later he was playing phantom of the opera on it, experimenting with sliding the stylo vs. lifting it, laughing and saying it was the best thing ever.  even if he gets tired of it after a few days, it was worth $20.
These have been a must have in my house since my daughter was born. I love them bc they can be used in so many ways...I use for pacifiers, bottles, toys, basically anything that drops or needs a quick clean. Also, no need to get the travel pack bc you can put them in a sealed baggy or I use a really small plastic container that snaps and seals shut. They don't dry out either! My daughter stopped using a pacifier at about 3 1/2 months (she's 5 months now) but I still use them all the time for the above mentioned. Must have!!!! It's also a great shower gift bc that's how I got hooked!
i so wish i was able to breastfeed without this little piece of plastic, but apparently its not going to happen. because of bleeding/cracked nipples, ineffective latching by my children my first child was exclusively pump/bottle fed. that lasted 6 months. my second child i discovered the shield and i lasted 9 months. my third baby i went to the shield on day 3, and were at 5 weeks now. there is no way i would be able to feed them without. and after pumping exclusively for 6 months, this little thing has been a lifesaver! yes, it is a pain to make sure i have it with us, but worth it!
i have been using the cuisinart bottle sterilizer for the past month, and am very happy with this purchase. the bottom rack can hold up to six bottles (including oversized ones such as my comotomo and mimijumi bottles), and the top rack can hold assorted pump components/pacifiers/etc. it takes less than 10 minutes to run a cycle, and it's simple to run. just pour a measured amount of water in, using the measuring cup that stores in the lid, and turn the knob to &#34;on.&#34; when it has completed its cycle, i just pour the remaining water down the sink -- everything stays very clean.
I love my mam products, they are so easy to clean and the microwave sanitation was a life saver when we went on vacations since almost every hotel has a microwave and I didn't have to bring along things to clean them with. They have held up very nice over the last almost eight months my daughter has used them. She loved these bottles straight from the start even with me breast feeding at first she took these right away. They do leak often, but I have come to realize it's almost impossible to find a bottle that doesn't leak. I also use the pacifiers by mam and she loved those as well.
great seat!  it is a seat that will work from birth on up (and up and up!).  some of the features make it quite convenient (such as the rear-facing recline position that makes it work for infants and the adjustable head piece that eliminates the need to remove the cover and re-thread the seatbelt as the child grows - as well as making it last much longer by keeping it safe and comfortable for tall children).  this is good value for money.  the sapphire color is bright and works well for girls or boys.  the seat isn't overly cushy, but it seems safe, comfortable, and of sturdy material.
I usually rate a product; however, but some Seller's really hike up a price on Amazon (edit: like this one had it for double). Shop around, Babies R Us, Target & other retail stores sell this exact product for $5.99. CVS even cheaper at times!<br /><br />EDIT: 6/30/12<br />Changing review to reflect actual product. Love the MAM glow in dark pacis. We have 4 for the crib at night. Best to charge them for a couple minutes near a light to shine brightest during the night. IT will dull through night! NOte -they sell for 5.99 typical retail (not to mention sales on buy 1 get 1/2 off at BRU)
i've tried several teethers for my a 4-month old, she's ignored every single one of them and continued to be very uncomfortable at times. then i noticed tiny bite marks on her little hands! i found this theether, thanks to all amazon reviewers. this one is just the right shape, size, thickness and texture - she can hold it and turn it the way she wants nicely. she still puts her fists into her mouth, but no bite marks any more - she uses her avent teether for when she needs to bite real hard. the actual colour is a bit warmer than the one in the picture. cute, safe and it really works!
printed with whey-based inks, gorgeous motif, and high quality wood, this made for a very impressive gift that was a big hit at a baby shower for my organic-minded, vegan niece who chose not to know the gender of her baby.  she ended up giving birth to a boy, but either way, i knew that this beautiful growth chart would be gender-neutral and wonderful for either boy or girl.  everyone loved it.  personally, i have used only wooden growth charts with my own children because they are longer-lasting, the ink doesn't rub off like with plastic or paper, and they become true family heirlooms.
my son, who is 10 months old, immediately knows how to use it. he never likes/cares any of teething toys, i bought about 10 different shape teething toys, i bought for him.therefore, i was a little bit worry that he will not like this training toothbrush. after read all the reviews, i decided to give it a shot. he just loves it at the very 1st time i gave to him. the brush is soft enough for his baby gum and the handles were so easy for him to grape and bend.actually, i am thinking to get another one just in case we lose this one.i will defiantly recommend this product to all my friends.
Our baby is 9 months old and can't live without a pacifier. We were using NUK orthodontic ones but I wasn't sure if it's 100% toxin free. I got these in 6-12 months. The nipple is small, similar size as NUK's 0-6 months ones, and the indent isn't deep enough to give space to the nose, and it has the rubber smell. But our baby doesn't care about any of these. He LOVES it. He's been sucking on it, chewing on the handle and the disk and just doesn't want let go of it. It's not only a paci for him, but also a teether and toy. So no need for me to buy a separate natural rubber teether for him!
i purchased them for my daughter who is still going through potty training.<br /><br />they are very cute, and work well for potty training and long trips away from home.  my child likes wearing undies and it's nice to know that her clothes will be spared (depending on the liquid intake).  i like to pare them with gerber training undies to allow for extra absorption on long trips away from home.<br /><br />they wash well, and dry well.  in my opinion they are sized a bit larger compare to gerber, but still work well.  if you child it's average size, i would recommend ordering a size down.
This is great for keeping the paci from popping out of an infant's mouth and onto the floor - it just stays right there and baby quickly learns to find it again when they want it.<br />The paci will no longer bounce across the floor and hide under furniture!<br />(I just wish my son took a paci for more than a few weeks!)<br />GREAT shower gift!!!<br /><br />Oh, and to clean it, I just held the paci part under hot water, washed it with soap, rinsed well, and pop it back in his mouth.  When the cuddly-part got dirty, I hand-washed in the sink & air-dry overnight.  (good reason to have 2!!)
This is an absolute lifesaver. My 2 month old son tends to lose his pacifier a lot, and the horse holds it perfectly in place. Plus, he loves to cuddle the horse! When he is not using the pacifier, he is cuddling it. He loves to chew on the feet too!    The only con for this is it's best when used in a swing, bouncer, carseat, etc. It tends to pop out when he is laying on his back and turning his head from side to side. But it's worth having! It'll pay for itself when you don't have to keep doing gymnastics leaning over the backseat trying to keep the pacifier in their mouth while driving!
I got this for my 3 month  old and he seems to LOVE it! He gets excited and  gurgles when he sees it coming toward him. I like that it gives him something to clutch and feel while sucking on the paci. I have read that at this age, babies like textures. I am going to order some more so that he always has one to play with wile the other is being washed. That said, others have complained about the paci not being able to separate from the plush part, I just fill a bowl with hot water and Meyers laundry detergent (just a dash) and let it soak for 10 minutes,rinse, squeeze it out and line dry it.
bag is not overly huge but not to small either. had no roblems with it.very comfortable to wear. of course this bag isn't made to please everyone i will say it can withstand some tugging, pulling and plenty of spills. easy to clean. and since i bought it for my wife she thought it was perfect. it suited our needs and most of the time i wear. and as you can see it's quite fashionable lol. i have no problem wearing this. but now if it was pink and flowery.... ehhhh idk. but overall it's a great product. if your a dad and you know you'll be having it with you most of the time, look no further.
bought this travel potty to keep in the car for the kids and it's perfect!  fits compactly under the driver's seat.  my 3 and 4 year old boys love to use it.  love that it uses gallon sized bags.  the two storage compartments are a bit tough to snap open at times, but maybe because our potty is still somewhat new.  compartments are great storage for extra bags, wipes, and spare undies.  i also keep a few nursing pads in there.  i found that if i put one at the bottom of the bag before the boys use the potty, it helps soak of some of the \\liquid\\ for less sloshy disposal.  would recommend!
we got this for our son for his first birthday. he loves it! it doesn't tip easily, even with the rocker attached. the fabric isn't quite what i thought it was going to be, but it still looks and feels great. everyone who sees this chair thinks it's so adorable, and they're right. it also shipped faster than we thought it would! edited to add another photo. he fell asleep in his chair one night! it has come in so handy for when he was sick and didn't have energy to move around. he sat in the chair and watched his cartoons with teddy. a great purchase that i haven't had a single regret about.
it's been a month since we purchased this carseat. our daughter seems to like it.<br />it looks very comfy. based on the safety ratings, it's one of the best out there.overall, it is a very good carseat.<br />i just wish it was a little easier to carry around - we live in nyc and rent a car whenever we travel, so carrying it around is not comfortable. it is bulky and big, but this is true for any convertible seat on the market. we didn't have a problem fitting it into the car.<br />update. so far we drove mazda 3, honda civic, audi 3 and had no problem fitting this car seat in the back seat.
i purchased this a few weeks ago for monitoring in the bedroom during daytime naps or during the night so that i could watch and hear what was going on.  this set up in a snap (mounting to a wall or sitting on a table), and gets great reception in most parts of the house. as compare to the alternative in this price range (the saftey 1st brand), this worked perfect out of the box.  the saftey 1st one did not broadcast as well, and the montior had a permanent roll to it (despite playing with the v hold knob constantly).  worth the investment for security and assurance. this is the brand to buy.
at first i didn't know if i even wanted a mobile for my first baby's room. however, after hearing from many other moms that i had to have one, i set out looking for one that wasn't overly cutesy, circusy, noisy or generally obnoxious. this definitely fits the bill. it is quite hypnotic to watch it spin gently in the air, and my 4-month-old loves staring at it. he often wakes up and begins making sweet coo noises - we say he is &#34;chatting&#34; with his elephants. i think it gives him something to occupy his attention so we don't have to immediately pick him up out of his crib when he wakes.
we purchased this car seat for our daughter and it has worked out perfectly. we have the \\latch\\ hooks in our car, so installation is a breeze. the only thing i would change about it is the overall size. it simply does not fit anywhere but in the center of the back seat. i know that's the safest place in most cars, but, our bmw 3 series just doesn't have the room to put her anywhere else, even though i'm sure it's just as safe. the stroller itself is bulky, as all the rest of the reviews have said, but we haven't had an issue with it. it still fits in our trunk, so that's all we care about.
wow do i wish i had this back when i had kids! i mean, i lived pushing strollers around to the park, shopping church, library, you name it! the skip hop grab and go stroller saddlebag is the right size, grabs on to any stroller, and it is super sturdy and durable! plus it is thick and insulated! one thing i loved is that the interior color is very light--dark interiors have moms looking and looking for those items... also many pockets for all of those items and water bottles too. very happy with this and will make a great gift for any busy mom! i am sending it to my niece who is having twins!
every parent with a standard snack container asks me about this one. the lid makes so much of a difference -- keep the food fresh and avoid spills or leaks or cheerio dust from getting all over diaper bag when tot isn't eating. it's great that the lid is tethered to the cup, and it's very clever that the tether becomes a handle for the child when the lid is off and the child is eating. when it's time to close it up, the handle &#34;disappears&#34; and it's more compact in your bag.<br /><br />i spent a long time trying to figure out which snack container to buy and i am so glad i found these.
These seem ridiculous to me, but I'm not the one who uses them. My daughter LOVES them. She especially loves to tick her thumb in the hole and quasi-suck her thumb. I bought a baggie of six or seven varieties of pacifiers to have on hand before my baby was born. You never know what they'll like. I didn't smell anything like vanilla with these. And they work just as well for us as the first year gumdrop pacifiers. She uses them interchangeably. I think these had annoying high shipping charges, if I remember correctly. So, if your baby likes this shape you might just try the cheaper ones first.
One of my favorites for my children.  These are so easy for your baby to find when looking for them.  As they get older, they can hold onto them without them falling all over the place and getting dirty, and won't have to wake you up in the middle of the night if they misplace it, my babies always seemed to find it because of the stuffed animal at the end that is easy to grab.  Some of animals sit better then others - the frog, monkey, and cat have a flat stomach so they can sit flat on your infant, so keep that in mind. I have 2 of these for my second child and he's kept up with both of them.
And mom does too! This helps hold the pacifier in the baby's mouth, or at least close enough to it that he can get the paci back in on his own. It has just enough wait to help hold the pacifier in place, but not so much that it disrupts the baby. It's also something that the baby clearly loves to hold onto! Just wish there were more animal choices and that these were a little bit easier to find in stores. The one downside is that they're a little hard to clean without getting the animal attached soaked, but that's such a small point that it doesn't take away from how wonderful these things are!
We're on our 5th and 6th of these, and I wished I'd just bought a bunch at a sale vs. replacing them as they get lost.  These are totally worth having multiples of:  ones for the stroller, the crib, the play area, etc.  They also clean easily in the washer and dryer.  It was great to see the twins practice grasping with these and navigating the pacis to their mouths on their own.  At a year old, the twins now fight over them if only one is present.  The prices totally fluctuate, so shop around.  You could make your own, but if you're short on time (and already exhaused!) these are a life saver.
Our baby began using the soothie as soon as she got home from the hospital and loves it.  It is hilarious to watch her little mouth work!  Everyone laughs when they see it for the first time.  I have no problems breastfeeding (but I also don't believe in nipple confusion b/c she eats from bottles since day one, and breastfeeds, and sucks the soothie).  I think that some babies may be more particular than others because mine also uses mam and advent pacies when we can't find the soothie.  I think these are a good deal and are fun because you can put your finger inside and feel the mouth working.
i spent a long time researching cribs (as i do with most \\big purchase\\ items), and this crib is phenomenal for the money!  i put it together, 9 months pregnant, with my 10 year old daughter.  it went together flawlessly, we had no missing or extra parts, and everything went as it should.  i've put together quite a bit of furniture, and the ease of this assembly was great!  we didn't have a hard time at all with the instructions, and all in all, are very happy with this purchase.  the crib is very sturdy, and the color looks rich and expensive.  would buy again, every time - highly recommend!
I thought paying over $10 for a pacifier was ridiculous, but Wubbanubs are worth every penny. They help keep the pacifier in place, and my son loves playing with the stuffed animal portion. I believe it helps with his motor skills. The only downside is that my dog thinks it's his chew toy, ha! That is obviously not a fault of the product, though. Good thing it's easy to wash and dry. :) We also have the giraffe and longhorn wubbanubs. I think the animals with the longer legs (the giraffe and longhorn) stay in place a bit better because their feet are weighted a bit more, but we love all of them.
there are so many cups out there to choose from. i am so grateful that playtex still makes the basic &#34;sippy cup.&#34; i wish i would have just gone to the old standby instead of wasting money on other products. it is simple, proportionate to small mouths, easy for the kiddo's to drink from and fairly simple to clean. this cup allows for them to tilt their heads back, the way they love to do and drink without an issue regarding flow. the others i have tried (&#34;nuby straw sippy cup&#34; for instance) don't work with the way kids typically drink, head way back and cup tipped high in the air.
I decided before my baby was born that I was going to use the soothies, so I stocked up. I just kept being told that they were the only ones that their babies would take! But a friend of mine bought me a pack of MAM pacifiers and my baby loves, loves them! The shape of the nipple is great, and the sterilizing box is awesome. I've only ordered some from Amazon once, and luckily I got blue ones for my son. I've also bought some from Target, who carries all different sizes. I gave some to another friend with a newborn and now her baby girl is hooked too! Such a great product with such cute designs.
we purchased this for our new baby nursery and have been very pleased.  although we realize that the infant can not use a bumper pad and the blanket, i still love how all the pieces come together.  the purples, blues, greens, and beige compliment each other and give you several color options to use in the room.  i think this would look great with any color furniture.  when i was ordering the coordinating pieces, i was confused on what material this was going to be.  it is a light corduroy as are the 2 wall hanging plaques.  those are fabric wrapped around a wood frame. overall- love the product.
My daughter started eating oranges from this at 6 months old and she loves it. We use it about weekly.  It also doubles as a teether.  Some say it is hard to open and close.  It is a bit tough, so for you grandparents with arthritis,  you may have a hard time.  It just takes a pit of patience.  Otherwise I found it to be a very sturdy product. As far as the mesh netting goes, I have had no discoloration on mine after 3 months of use it still looks new.  I boil my daughters bottles and I just dip the mesh in the boiling water.  They do make replacement netting if your concerned about the coloring.
what a great find these advice cards were! perfect addition to our jungle themed shower. they were really high quality and the honoree loved reading all of the guesses and sentiments left by all her guests. would definitely buy again!<br /><br />[[asin:b00efyadta baby shower advice & prediction cards for mom king of jungle animal themed (50-cards)]]<br /><br />also bought the baby wishes [[asin:b00ehjy43y wishes for baby - baby shower game - jungle themed (50-sheets)]]<br /><br />and the word find to match.

My three month old son LOVES his Wubbanub!  He holds onto the stuffed puppy and is able to maneuver the pacifier into his mouth all on his own, which saves me from washing so many dropped pacifiers.  The stuffed animals are all really cute, and they are the perfect size for little hands to pick up and squeeze.  My son likes to hold onto his Wubba, pacifier within easy reach if he feels like sucking, while he swings and sleeps.  In fact, now that we have one, I am not sure I could get him to go to sleep without it!  I would recommend this to anyone with a little one that likes pacifiers.  Love it!
The 0-3 month Soothies are the ONLY pacifier our little connoisseur will use.<br /><br />I love that they are a simple design, no chance for water or moisture to get caught inside the nipple in the dishwasher.  I regularly run these through with our dishes and they come out perfect.<br /><br />The only caveat is that they aren't compatible with most of the paci clips you can find commercially, I had to come online to find a paci grip with a rope attachment on it.<br /><br />I wish they made them in more colors!  Getting tired of the green ones everywhere in my house - would love orange maybe?  :)
My infant will only use this pacifier, and I routinely recommend it to parents who have tried other pacifiers and their child doesn't not take to them. I like that the pacifier is all in one piece and that there aren't any hard parts to be uncomfortably places if lost in bed or the car seat. This pacifier does not leave marks on the face, and the cut out makes it so the child's nose isn't covered.    This pacifier is difficult to find in retail stores, but can be ordered in bulk from the supplier. My only complaint about this pacifier is that ordinary pacifier clips do not work with this pacifier.
this is the best crib sheet i have ever bought. i have had multiple crib sheets that just aren't up to par. every single one of them doesn't fit over my daughters mattress without a lot of stretching, struggling and effort. this sheet fits perfectly and it is so soft. i love this sheet so much to the point that when i wash it i don't put another sheet on, i just wait for this one to finish in the washer and dryer. so i decided to buy two more for her crib. i have another baby on the way and i bought a sheet for her crib and one exactly like this for her cradle as well. it is a must buy in my book!
1. You can't beat the price...EXCELLENT!<br /><br />2. Easy to use.<br /><br />3. Doesn't take up much space.  I've even packed it in my suitcase and it travels well.<br /><br />4. Great for warming food & bottles.<br /><br />Suggestions:<br /><br />1. Only use distilled water in it...works much better.<br /><br />2. For cleaning: Once a month use a mixture of half distilled water & white vinegar (about 2 oz. total) pour it in the warmer and turn it on.  Doesn't smell great, but works FANTASTICALLY!!!<br /><br />LOVE, LOVE, LOVE IT!!!<br /><br />P.S.  I've been using this product for 6+ months now.
with a 4 year old and a 2 year old we have been been through 5 carriers, for various reasons. this one is the best so far. we love that it has such a high weight limit. and love that it is so easy to get on and off. the kids just hop on my back and i pull the straps over them and latch -- super easy. we had initially purchased the onya outback and found the fabric too rough on my shoulders. the cruiser is much smoother. i was worried the fabric would be too warm, but that has not been a problem. i'll try to remember to update this in july/aug after we use it when it is really hot and humid outside!
I was skeptical about purchasing this because you can buy 6 of these pacifiers for the price of this one on a cat. My daughter loves the soothie pacifiers but those dang things disappear so fast because they bounce and roll. With the wubbanub I no longer have to worry about lost pacifiers, my daughter loves playing with it and if the pacifier isnt in her mouth usually one of its legs are. Overall I think it was worth it because it keeps track of the pacifier for me, it keeps the pacifier in place and it also gives my daugther something to entertain herself with. I actually ended up ordering another.
Seriously, this WubbaNub has SAVED me!!  My daughter was never super attached to her paci, but when she did take it, she preferred the Soothie. She really stopped sucking on a paci around 2 months old.  She started using the pacifier just to chew on as a teething toy at around 6 months, so I got her the WubbaNub, because it seemed like it'd be easier for her to handle.  Lo and behold, she started sucking on like it was some new discovery!! It calms her when she's upset, and she absolutely loves this still at 8 months old!  And since it makes her happy, it makes me happy too鈥nd gets a 5 star rating!
these decals are so great. pretty colors and textures, they're a lot of fun to look at and walk the line nicely between realism, art, and cheerfulness. they aren't cartoony, which i really appreciate. i wish there was also a digger, but this set is pretty great for my vehicle-obsessed three year old. easy to install, and still stuck tight three months later. we also got the set with planes, helicopters, hot air balloons and a blimp, love that one too.  -- updating after 2 years: these are still on the wall more than two years later. i love them, and they have grown up really well from age 3.5 to 5.5.
My baby is 3 mos old and we introduced a pacifier around 4 weeks.  It took exactly 2 nights of trying to find spit out pacifiers on the floor before we ordered a Wubba Nub.  He loves that he can hold onto the soft stuffed animal, and I love that it's much harder for him to launch this across the room.  As he's gotten bigger, he can now navigate the pacifier into his mouth by holding on to the Dino and it helps him put himself back to sleep.  I wash it frequently since he takes it to daycare, and it has held up very well in the washing machine.  This is my new go to product for all my new mom friends!
I love these! I have used them for my baby since he was about a month old. He is almost 5 months old now. They seem to work great! I love the size. I tried a few other brands and my baby just would not take them. They were all too long or the shape was one he didn't like. These seem to be the shape and length that he likes. I actually bought a ton of these because the baby kept dropping them everywhere. I seriously will not buy any other kind. They don't have these in the store so I have to purchase them on Amazon and just wait for them to be shipped. I will be using these for my next babies for sure.
i use the soother as part of our bedtime routine--  eat, bathe, rock for about ten minutes and read a story and/or sing a lullaby, into the crib with her pacifier, then turn on the soother... works everytime!  my baby (now 2 1/2 months) sleeps through the night (approx. 9pm til 4am)most of the time thanks to this soother!  she loves to watch it, as if it gives her time to unwind before falling asleep.  sometimes she'll begin crying when it goes off, so i'll have to turn it back on one more time before she'll fall asleep.  my only complaint---  eats batteries, but still worth the sleep i'm now getting!
i bought this product for my eight month old son after trying multiple other products that just haven't worked at all.  it has really helped to calm him down and soothe him while i know he's in so much pain.  when i first put the necklace on he was really intrigued with it, and of course wanted to put it in his mouth (he is teething and eight months), but i tucked it underneath his onesie and distracted him with another toy and the necklace was soon forgotten.  he has been so much better all day today.  i was a frazzled mom, wondering how i would get through teething with this child until i found this!
we started introducing bottle to our baby when she was 8 weeks old. She didn't take Dr. brown. Pedietrician suggested Playtex Drop-In natural latch on, which has a flater and softer nipple. She still didn't like it. I kind of started worrying if we would have to try a million brands to figure out which she will take. I've heard about MAM before, so started with MAM. Lucky us! The first time she latched on, it was not perfect but at least she didn't resist or play with it. The 2nd time she finished 2 oz! Now she is 13 weeks, no problem with bottle feeding any more. Thank you MAM for such a great product!
i walk my dog and have to take my kids out with me in the stroller every day unless it's pouring rain. i have two of these and i feel they really save me at least 20 minutes if not more every day. with the bundleme, i don't have to spend time getting coats, gloves, hats, shoes, socks for both kids and then strapping them in the stroller. i just plop them in the bundleme in whatever they were wearing inside (usually just one layer of clothing). they are so comfy on our walks, they just fall right asleep. i live in maryland and it does get cold here so i opted for the arctic version and i have no regrets.
I had the giraffe on my registry and received it as a gift... I'm so glad I did because my son loves these Wubbanubs. He won't take the other pacifiers I tried. It is just a Soothie, sure... But my son loves hugging the giraffe and the bear and it definitely makes my life a tiny bit easier because these do not fall to the ground every time it falls out of his mouth. They're adorable too. I only wish there was a way to throw the plush part into the washer and dryer. I don't mind hand-washing but air drying takes too long! That's why I had to order the bear so he'd have a spare. Would definitely buy again.
These are great pacifiers. My two and half month old daughter loves them! We tried several brands like MAM, Nuk, Munchkin and Dr. Brown's. At first we thought Dr. Brown's would work better because we use their bottle system. She likes Dr. Brown's but she likes MAM even better. MAM's pacifiers look very cute and we also combine with the pacifier clips. The clips have bright color so you can easily identify where it is and the flexible clip allows you to adjust the tightness to thickness of baby clothes easily. We are very satisfied with the purchase and highly recommend these pacifiers to all new parents.
I have six of these things. They're wonderful because they're easy for babies to find in the night if they're dropped, ensuring that they don't wake up as often, and because of their size, I have only ever lost one. They started selling them at Babies 'R Us recently, but they don't seem to be made of the same quality, so I only buy the special edition ones- this one is SO soft. We also have the caterpillar (perfect for newborns tiny hands), two dog and a cats. One of the cat ones is from when they first came out in 2011 and one is a more recent one. The newer one is smaller in size and not nearly as soft.
citystroll 2-in-1 stroller organizer/caddy<br />i have a daycare and use a 4 top stroller, which this fit without a problem.  this is such a handy thing to have with kids, it holds a pkg of wipes, my cell phone and a bottle.  this organizer also comes with a lift out caddy that has a long shoulder strap, so it can be worn over the shoulder like a purse.  this was a great find and a great purchase, it has been very handy with little ones on the go.<br /><br />i received this item at a discounted rate in exchange for a review. regardless the opinions found herein are based on my experiences with the product
These pacifiers really do glow in the dark! I have them sitting out in the kitchen where the lights are on and off throughout the day, so it's not like they are getting direct light all the time to charge. The glow is strong enough so you can find them in the crib, but slight enough that it doesn't bother baby who is trying to fall asleep.  So around 3 am after 8 hours of sitting in a dark crib, I can still find these things and pop it in baby's mouth, and then baby just drifts off to sleep.  HA! Not really, but these paci's do help. Baby has been using these since he was 2 months old and is now 6 months.
NUK pacifiers have worked the best with both of my babies, when other pacifiers were rejected. (And I spent a lot of money on various brands). They are durable and last a long time..and the ring make is convenient to hold on your finger or use with a pacifier clip. The only thing is that they are sometimes hard to clean. When you use soap and water, it gets inside the nipple. In order to get it out, you have to cup your hand with water while squeezing the nipple. This gets some water inside to wash the soap out. After that, I always throw them in the sanitizer. Not a big deal. I will continue to buy NUKs!

love love love this baby carrier!! i did a ton of research and ended up buying this carrier (after other buys that i was not pleased with) and i am so happy with the final decision on this one. it fits both my husband and i comfortably, it is so easy to take on and of, and it is lightweight enough to bring any where.  and most importantly, my twin boys like it!!! the base is wide enough to support their butts which is better for their hips and they fit inside completely as they are still infant sized. i will be excited when they are bigger and we can use it in more positions! over all i love my bitty bean!
I got this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review. This orthodontic pacifier is tasteless and odor-free silicone nipple that makes an easy transition between pacifier, breast, and bottle. I myself is a breastfeeding mom and I can say that this can make an easy transition from my breast to this pacifier. Although we had several times to try to make him used to it but after several tries he already get used to it. My baby is now very comfortable in using them. It is also easy to clean and sterilize it afterwards. I would definitely recommend this pacifiers to my friends and relatives!
for moms who baby wear this is a great product. our son is constantly on us. we have used so many carriers with him and this is by far the best carrier. we use the 360 every day. i wish i could compare the 360 to the original for you, but when we were deciding between the two we decided on the 360 because we wanted the front carry option since our son is a wiggler. you still have all the positions the original carrier offers. we live the hip carry. he is so comfortable in the carrier.. the first time we put him in it he fell right to sleep. we will make a video soon comparing the 360 to our other carriers.
We have purchased the alligator (which my dog decided was his chew toy), the giraffe, and the longhorn. I like the longhorn and the puppy the best. The giraffe's neck makes it a little less stable than the animals with the normal necks. We have yet to lose one of these because they're very visible, and my son loves the soft animal to grasp. Such a great invention! I make sure to have one with us at all times. The weight of the animals make them stay in place more than traditional pacifiers. They are also to clean (machine washable) and air dry very quickly. Don't hesitate to buy this-your baby will love it!
These are the best pacifiers! I love the Monkey, because of all the textures. This is our second one of this design. My little one wore the first one out. He is 9 months old, but he doesn't have any teeth yet. So we are still using these. You may want to consider a orthodontic pacifier once they have teeth. I wish they would make them with an orthodontic pacifier attached for later. I will be buying these as gifts for anyone expecting. You can easily wash them in the washer to keep them clean. One thing that is nice is being able to grab them easy if they are dropped. You can not go wrong with any of these!
My son has had some sort of break out or allergic reaction to regular pacifiers since he was around 3 months old.  I have tried EVERYTHING you could possibly think of to clear it up.  Medications, creams, pacifiers with more vents, all different brands, latex, silicone, and even tried breaking him of using a pacifier all together.  He would have red bumps on the area around his mouth that would sometimes form blisters, crack, and bleed.  At 6 months old I finally bought these pacifiers as my last resort and since using them we have not had any breakouts at all!!<br />It has been wonderful for my son and me.
My little girl loves these! It was the only bottle she would take out of about 5 other brands we tried. It is the closest thing to the real deal I have found. Highly recommend to anyone who is having to supplement their breast milk it doesn't seem to cause nipple confusion like others do. My little one can switch from breast to bottle with no problem. I can't give more than 5 stars but I'd like to! Love love love this product!! Oh and bonus having the binkies! My baby girl wouldn't take any other binky not even the ones they give at the hospital but she takes these and it has allowed this mamma extra sleep!
cute bag. i gave it 5 stars because the price is so cheap, especially for a winnie the pooh item with a very cute print.<br />because it was so cheap, i wasn't expecting much. it's just a simple bag, nothing fancy, no inside pockets, just &#34;bands&#34; on the inside to tuck things into like diapers. the outside has the pouches for storage.<br />my only problem was the bag is actually pretty blue in color and you can't really tell from the picture how blue it is. light blue, a baby blue color, but not nearly as &#34;white&#34;/blue as the picture seems, i actually thought it would be white it is very blue.
It's fairly straightforward and simple, which is what we like about it.  It can hold 2 (maybe 3 if they're small and flexible) pacifiers.  The hanging portion of the holder has a 'split-ring' design so that it easy to hook onto our stroller or any other loop.<br /><br />It's made of stiff plastic, which actually works out well for us.  Because it keeps it shape, it has less of a chance of getting lost in the diaper bag.  Rather than using Ziploc bags, which always seemed a little 'eh' this works well.  It's also easy to stay organized--a pacifier in the case is clean, everything else is assumed to be dirty.
I'm in my mid-30's.  Everyone around me is having babies.  I've given one of these to at least 10 new mothers and they ALL love them.  I'm actually tagged in several photos of babies sucking on these adorable WubbaNubs.  I can often find one that pairs with any nursery theme, great for little hands to hold onto, easy to find, and the paci is the same as the one they give at all the local hospitals - something about that rubber and size makes it irresistible for newbies.  Buy a bunch to have on hand, throw on top of a gift, it's a special little bonus gift not many mamas tend to know about - they'll love it.
I got the brown puppy Wubbanub at a store while we were doing our 4D ultrasound months ago and after how much baby loved it, I ordered three more!  Thank goodness I did because our real puppy decided that he wanted the original one as his chew toy. :/  Our baby although only a newborn likes to hold on to these and I love how they lay on her chest perfectly so you don't have to keep fixing it when it falls out.  She loves staring at them even when she's not sucking on them and likes to hold one of the arms as she falls asleep for a nap.  I am so thrilled with these that I suggest them to all my mommy friends.
this is a great mirror. i purchased it for my husband's car (nissan xterra) which doesn't have a middle headrest. it was easy to install on the side headrest (1 min) and angled in 30 seconds for a perfect view of baby from the driver's side. now i have mirror envy! the mirror is much clearer and higher quality than a standard baby mirror. not only can we see our precious cargo with stunning clarity, he really seems to enjoy admiring himself! and anything that keeps baby happy during long car rides is a bonus! i don't have anything bad to say other than beware of mirror envy. i may be buying a second one soon!
Just purchased this after reading reviews on a Mom FB page.  This pacifier is great!  Slides right into my baby's mouth and doesn't come out as often as the Philips Avent pacifier which I had been previously using (since that pacifier has a little handle). At first I didn't like that it didn't have a handle, but that's one of the reasons why it doesn't fall out.  Very cute prints too.  Also it comes with a sanitizing box which you fill with a little bit of water and sanitize in the microwave!  Genious!!  I will be purchasing a couple more boxes to have extras lying around since we are always losing pacifiers.
This is an amazing pacifier.  It actually stayed in my 6 week old daughter's mouth!  The soothie pacifier is the only kind my baby likes, but I was constantly having to pick it up or hold it in her mouth for her.  She was too young to hold it in her mouth herself.  The wubbanub is weighed down by the attached stuffed animal and it rests on your baby's chest.  So if it does fall out, it can usually be recovered by your little one.  This was a lifesaver during a 7 hour car ride!  I'm such a fan that I bought a second one because I don't know what I would do if we ever lost or misplaced the original one we bought
Why didn't I think of this? My daughter loves her giraffe. We have the duck and the puppy dog and decided to get her the giraffe since it was so cute. The duck and giraffe are nice and thin and light, making it easier for her to hold and not fall out of her mouth because of the weight. The puppy is really bulky and heavy and we had a hard time keeping up with it. She loves to play with the ears of the giraffe as well. It's great becuase the pacifers alone are rubber and bounce when they hit the ground. Attached to the stuffed animal, we haven't had to get down on our hands and knees looking for it. It's great!
....well, maybe that's a bit of an extreme statement, but that's how happy I am with these binkys! I looked around for weeks locally trying to find an all-natural, one-piece option. Someone recommended these on a forum, and we've been using them ever since.<br /><br />Some people are put off by their child pulling the binky out with their finger and the loop. It is a minor issue for us. Once she got a little older, the loop works for us - she can easily grab it and pop the binky back into her mouth.<br /><br />This is another standard shower gift I include for new moms. I hate to see a baby using anything else!
I too got these pacifiers in a gift bag from either Babies R Us or Buy Buy Baby and would highly recommend for newborns.<br /><br />That said, we didn't use these until nursing was well established, maybe about 5-6 weeks or so.  I was reluctlant to use but there are times when a pacifier is helpful.  These were the only ones he'd take.  And when we started doing a bottle a day just to get him used to the bottle he wouldn't take any other nipples but the MAM nipples so the pacifier worked well as a transition to the bottle.<br /><br />Pacifiers are widely available everywhere, bottles/nipples are not (off topic).
So we've tried almost all of the popular brands. She loves the MAM design! Almost seems effortless for her to suckle. The shape of the nipple seems to make the most sense.  As the baby learns to start rolling over and crawling, the pacifier design became so much more important to us. This on actually displaces the impact when she face plants while learning to crawl...You'll see. Great to have the removal strap option that clamps the pacifier to her clothes. These are overall, easy to clean and we found that at least in our baby's case, we know when to replace them...When the graphic starts to wear off, its time.
So far, I've tried to give soothie, nuk, and gumdrop pacifiers to my daughter.  My daughter loves the gumdrop pacifier and I like that it does not cover or rub against her nose like the soothie or leave marks on her cheeks like the nuk.  We received the gumdrop pacifier at the hospital and I just ordered 4 more!  Update: Still a huge fan of these and we continued buying through the various stages. When we were given other pacifiers as gifts, we would try them, but never switched brands. My daughter has always preferred the GumDrop pacifiers and still does today. Now it's time to start weaning off of the pacifier!
If you are a parent who pacifies their babies with these wonderful devices, you know how difficult it can be to keep track of these darned things. Buy this pack and put them everywhere you go (in the car, various rooms, hiding spots for an emergency). They are the same great quality you expect when you buy them in twos for twice the price in the grocery or department store. So next time your kid throws his pacifier into the mysterious bermuda triangle of pacifier extinction... no sweat... just grab another one. Our son loves to throw everything (including pacifiers) into the trash when we have our backs turned :)
~background~<br />i purchased this bib for my 3 month old son.<br /><br />~pros~<br />- great quality.<br />- unique and fun design that's definitely a conversation piece.<br /><br />~cons~<br />- not absorbent.  it's more repellent due to the material and finish.<br /><br />~notes~<br />- definitely for smaller/younger babies.  as a previous reviewer stated, the interior circumference of the bib closed is approximately 11 inches.<br /><br />~conclusion~<br />this is more of a novelty item than functional bib.<br /><br />we used this in conjunction with the [[asin:b007m2og86 mustache pacifier]] for even more fun!
my daughter doesn't really like pacifiers and has a very difficult time keeping them in her mouth, but while in the car, this has been a lifesaver because it is small and better shaped than most other pacifiers (prob the reason they give them to you in the hospital) also, it has the hole where you can stick your finger to help your baby keep it in their mouths.  when she got older and was teething, she sucked on the paci/my finger so hard, but it worked great for her.<br /><br />downside is that there is no place to hook a holder to it, so we lost it quite a bit (thank god for bottled water to clean it on the go!)
Cute - yes, but I really bought this for me, it helps me keep track of the binky (pacifier).  The colors are bright and our 3 month old is able to grab it and pull the bink to his mouth  all on his own.  I like that it is super lightweight and there are no beads for a possible choking  hazard if a seam opened up.  The wubbanub won't get lost in a seat crevice or hit the floor  and roll under a sofa and it is easily seen even at night.  We spot clean the dragon as needed  and wash the soothie on a regular basis and have had no issues with pilling or fading.  No   regrets on this purchase.  $16.95 and free shipping.
we bought this to help us get through a summer of traveling and an international move. i feel like it gave our two year old some extra security, to have the same bed every night, no matter where we were. it definitely has a fort vibe, and she thought it was very cool.<br />she did figure out how to unzip it in about five minutes, so if like us you have a kid who won't sleep if they can get free, you might want to factor that in to your purchase decision. she did get used to having to go to sleep once in it though.<br />it is very durable, and easy to rinse out, with a quick drying time. i definitely recommend this!
super cute little art pieces. even though our nursery is a green, blue and brown color scheme- these canvas art pieces still fit in really nicely. the colors aren't too bold and the cuteness of dogs on planes catches your attention without loud colors being thrown at you and ruining the color scheme. they are not too small but not too large so they were easy to affix onto the walls without drilling. we used some hooks fixed with wall tape and they secured great! this is probably my boyfriend's favorite nursery item that i have bought!<br /><br />i received these canvas art pieces at a discount for testing purposes.
These Phillips Avent Soothie Pacifiers were the only kind that my daughter would use. My wife and I received several different kinds from baby showers, but my daughter would just spit them out and fuss even more than before. I don't know what it is about them that she likes so much, but they work wonders for calming her down.<br /><br />I also prefer these over others because of their simple design which makes cleaning and sanitizing easy.<br /><br />FYI: My daughter is 3 months old and we have been using these from week 1. If she changes her preference on pacifiers at any point, I'll be sure to update this review.
This is the same kind of pacifier you get in the hospital - and there is a reason for this:  newborns prefer this one.  As a first time parent-to-be I bought, and was given several different types of pacifiers - of course my son's favorite is the one we have only one of:  the one he went home with from the hospital.  I tried to get him to take another one, since I was afraid we'd loose this one (plus it's huge, and covers his cute little face so I wanted him to try the smaller clear one....no way he said!).  It was tough finding these in stores so I resorted to Amazon and bought SEVERAL so we will never be without!
The hospital my son was born in used a 'Soothie' on him and I've used them ever since.  I love the 'Soothie' but it isn't easy to keep track of because the standard pacifier clips don't work on it.<br /><br />I started searching for a way to make it easier to keep track of.  Since his theme animal is the giraffe I found this cute way to hold onto the 'Soothie'.<br /><br />We call him 'Edgar' and I love it because it is cute and more importantly I can find it!<br /><br />The only issue I have with it is that Grandma had to reinforce the stitching in his neck right after we got it.  Otherwise, it has been a lifesaver!
not only were they super affordable, but they are super durable. i exclusively pumped for my now 2 year old daughter (and always had a 2 + month supply in the freezer) so i went through a ton of bags, every brand had some that leaked, some more than others. i ended up buying simpleese bags, but they were insanely expensive ( i spent the money because they didn't leak) my now 4 month old nurses like a champ, but i still produce more than she drinks, so i pump a couple times a day to keep the supply up and in case we need to give her a bottle. these are the best bags i have ever tired!!! i wish i had them 2 years ago.
I love these pacifiers. My son was born into the NICU and was given the same pacifier. I thought it was big and ugly, so I tried to get him to use the smaller ones, he refused. I found these one day and loved the different animals on the end. I throw the whole item in the washer and dryer, then wash off the pacifier with soap and water before I give it to my son. He loved it, he would hold on to it's arms and pluck it into his mouth when just a few months old. Then when I no longer wanted him to use a pacifier, I cut it away and he was still able to comfort himself with the stuffed animal. They also make great gifts!
i bought this not for a baby but for a way to keep a watchful \\eye\\ on an elderly parent. it has been the perfect way to give her some space and not intrude all the time. but yet make me feel better i can see and hear how she is doing. i can hear her clearly and she can hear me. for her she still has her privacy as you can turn off the visual feed. our house is cut up in levels. and this is the perfect way to not have to run up and down steps. this was the best thing i could have gotten for our situation. no interference from phones, computers or cell phones. picture is clear both in daylight and with night vision.
This is the first pacifier my baby was able to put in her mouth by herself. She only uses pacis at her bedtime, and even though I leave several simple soothie pacifiers in her crib along with this Wubbanub Kitten one, she always reaches for the Kitty paci first. She likes it so much, we got another one, a Pink Horse, for her pack-and-play at her grandparents. I must say though the Tabby Kitten feels like it's of a much better quality, definitely softer, cuddlier fabric, than the one the Horse pacifier is made of.   Oh, and the baby with the little kitten hanging from her mouth looks really, really, REALLY adorable :)
I see some people complaining about the size/having difficulty keeping them in their infants mouth. While the pacifier will fall out easier than others, I find that as long as you attach it to something it stays in fine. I use a Paci Plushie (you can buy them online, they are like a Wubanub but you can use any pacifier in them, including these) and it works great. The stuffed animal keeps it in place. If you do buy a Paci Plushie they used to have a coupon code PACI for 1/2 off that still might work.     Overall these are great and is my son's favorite pacifier for use in Maximus (the name of his monkey Paci Plushie.
We have always been familiar with the Vanilla Soothie pacifiers as they are given out by the hospital we delivered at. We used them with our first child back in 2006 and have continued the tradition with our more recent arrival. Our kids have NOT liked any other pacifiers and were extremely fickle as to which one they take, but the Soothies have never failed us.<br /><br />I have never had one of the pacifiers degrade in any way. Generally we toss them long before that point (shortly after the Vanilla scent goes away), so we can definitely attest to the durability of the pacifiers. Completely worth every penny spent!
My guy loved his Cowie. The pacifier is very firmly attached and all the features are baby safe. Some people complain that it is smaller and lighter than they were expecting, but I considered that a plus and felt safe letting it sit on my newborn's chest. Unlike the other pacifier holders, the wubbunub is made of a velvety material. I put the whole thing in a lingerie bag and ran it through the wash; by the end of the spin cycle, it was always dry enough to hand back to the baby. The only downside is that once the pacifier is broken, the whole thing is done for. My guy chewed through the new one in less than 2 months.
for all those moms out there that get frustrated with a bulb suction, this suction device is probably the best way to go. you can get huge plugs out of your kid, and (at least for my kid) it doesn't make her as upset as a typical bulb suction will. the filters work well, and i've never had an issue there.<br /><br />the system is also very easy to clean, and the best part is that you can see through all of the parts. bulb suctions make me nervous because you can never tell what is going on inside of them even with proper cleaning. bulb suctions are still good for some stuff, but for everything else i use the nosefrida.
my son has been using dr brown bottles for 6 weeks now, he has horrible colic, gas and belly issues so i figured that was best. all the pieces in the dr brown bottles drove me nuts cleaning constantly!! my son loves the nuk paci so i bought these and he loves them! i have no idea what others issue is with the nipple its very obvious which side goes into the baby's mouth ha.. seriously people? and he has a hard suck the nipple never collapses in his mouth, and the air vent system works great! what i love the most is the formula does not drip all over his face like other bottles. i do wish the actual bottle was bpa free.
LOVE IT!! I do NOT like that the seller made it look like it was only $10 and then oh yeah, the shipping is $10 for this item....WWHHHHAAAATTT! give me a break. BUT 15-20 is about the normal price range for these things around the board so whatever dragon lady. Have it your way. It was always easy to find. I wash it like at least once a week and let it air dry and my little man loves it and I get comments on it all the time. It doesn't weigh nearly anything so it's not hard for him to keep in his mouth either like I was thinking. The wings are much more bright turquoise blue and i think it's even cuter than the picture.
i switched to cloth diapers a few months ago due to my daughter suffering from frequent rashes. we were trying to rid her of a nasty yeast rash while using cloth. so, i decided to try these liners to 1. keep her skin dry and 2. protect cloth from barrier cream! i am happy to report these liners keep her very dry in terms of a barrier between prefold diapers that are absorbent, but wet feeling. this is the perfect solution! i am very thankful for this product and will continue to use them. not to mention, they do a great job protecting cloth from poo :) they catch the poo and keep the cloth diaper cleaner. great product!
i've had this set for 6 months now.  my 3 year old seems to do fine with it, and it has held up well.  i hand wash it, but the bowl has been dropped tons of time and has held up great without any dents or dings.  the bowl does slide around a bit (versus the plastic bowls we have with the rubber base), but i think that's just a trade off.  the cup is light and easy enough for my son to hold and drink from.  i saw some comments that this set is tiny, but the small plate size has worked for us.  i'd actually rather give my son two small servings than pile on all the food at once, but that's totally just personal preference.
My son seems to like this style pacifier the best so I went out and bought two more packages.  They come in pink & green or blue & green. (Buy them in the store though if you can find them.  I got mine at Target for $3.49/ two pack.)  I like that they are very easy to clean.  I will either run them through the dishwasher or in our microwave steam sterilizer to clean.  They do not come apart and it is nice to have a small handle to grab onto them or clip a pacifier tether onto it.  They do not wrap around my son's face like other brands and they have big air vents to keep from having too much moisture up against his face.
This is a really neat item, even though we ended up not using it. Our baby won't use a pacifier, so we ended up not actually using it, but the concept is really neat! You hang all of the pacifiers on the little &#34;branches&#34; like a tree, then seal the lid closed, with the measured amount of water in it, and microwave, and it sterilizes the pacifiers. They remain sterilized as long as the container is sealed closed, so if you are not going to use them for a few days, you just leave them in. It's really great, and I wish I would have known about it with some of our other babies who did use pacifiers! Highly recommend!
What a clever idea.  It's compact, quick, and easy to use which discourages laziness.  I had my daughter try it out for her toddler.  She keeps it on the counter, adds a pacifier (or passy as it's called by her son) when it's dirty, and when it's full, puts it in the microwave. Gabe loves his passy and this gets one to him fast.  This could be a great baby shower gift and I don't think it would be duplicated.  It's not too much to spend either for peace of mind or a gift.  Pacifiers often end up on the floor and I love that this removes the lazy factor--when we don't sterilize and should.  It also comes with 2 pacifiers.
Can't say enough good things about this little kitty.  My daughter loves it.  When she was itty bitty, the kitty would balance on her belly and help keep the pacifier in her mouth.  As she got bigger, the kitty would allow her to pick up the pacifier easily and put it back in her mouth.  Plus, we don't have trouble finding it when she drops it because the kitty is easy to spot.  It's also easy to wash.  I either toss is in the washer and then air dry it, or I just smother it with dish soap, rinse, and air dry.<br /><br />I buy these little things as gifts for all the baby showers I go to.  You should probably get one.  =)
Our son loves his wubbanuber!! He loves the soothie pacis so we had to try this. Not only is it cute, but it's very useful. It helps keep the pacifier near his mouth, so when he's done sucking it doesn't fall to the floor. To wash it I just use the pink bucket we left the hospital with and put a little soap and water and clean it by hand. It holds up well. My son spits up a lot so we have to wash it often. It does say you can machine wash in a mesh bag, but we haven't tried that yet. I don't want it to fall apart and we are without his favorite nubber. We will try after he gets his new one from Santa. I might update then.
today is the first day i'm trying out the simple wishes hands free pumping bra and i am pleasantly surprised! after getting everything fit and adjusted (totally custom!) the night before, i was ready to head back to work today. the material is so comfortable! it's super soft, yet supportive. pumping was a breeze today and i actually forgot i was pumping until the phone rang!!!! the great part was when i shut off the pump i could just leave everything attached and start up again after i hung up the phone. i think i am going to need another one as this is my new best friend at work! thank you to the simple wishes family!!!!
we love munchkin laundry stain treatment at our house. it removes tough stains easily without the harsh chemicals. last week i put it to the ultimate test! chili on a white shirt. i sprayed the treatment on which has a pleasant not over powering scent, let it sit for 5 minutes as the directions say, then tossed it in the wash. after it was done, there was no sign of tomato mess at all which is super impressive. i am always looking for ways to effectively clean, do laundry, etc, effectively without exposing my kids to all of the extra chemicals. i am happy to say this stain treatment has found a permanent home in my family!
does the job perfectly. the way i use it is as following: i preheat the bottle to a bit warmer temp that i would give it to the baby, but it in activated warmer and take it with us. this way the bottle cools a bit, but stays warm enough to comfortably eat. i had never activated on its own or accidentally as i read in one of the reviews, though my daughter had even pulled it out from the drawer and played with it a bit. it won't warm a bottle from a cooler a warm state though. you would need the heater with hot-hot water or something that plugs in (and those take up to 40 minutes to do the job, so i totally prefer this one).
[[asin:b002kar786 nuk silicone orthodontic nipples, slow flow, size 1, 2 pack]]  i feed my baby breast milk (medela pumping) and similac advance newborn (ready to feed, 2-fluid ounces). i was using the disposable nipple from similac for the medela bottle, too, but it was too wasted. so i was looking for a nipple fits to the similac ring (i'm not sure this is medela narrow or wide size ring.), and has slow flow.   this nuk nipple fits perfectly to the similac ring. i removed the disposable nipple from the ring and inserted the nuk nipple. perfect! my baby sucks this nipple as she sucks breast milk. it is definitely slow flow.
When I saw this pacifier attacher, I thought it was the cutest thing ever! Honestly, I didn't want my son using a pacifier past six months old, but I'm picking my battles. I ordered this when he was about four months old. When he was about five months old, he was able to put the paci in his mouth by himself. I think having the giraffe attached to it made it easier for him. This all translates into longer naps and more sleep at night. We get so many compliments on how cute this thing is. I think when we're ready to wean him off of the paci we will cut it off and still let him play with the giraffe. But seriously, he loves it!
love, love, love this car seat transporter! i purchased this for my trip to disney february 2015 and i breezed through the airport. i received so many stares and compliments and people asking me where i got it. it is easy to attach to a large car seat as i have the chicco a next fit, and you just pop open the wheels, loop the straps around the car seat and pull the handle up and you're on your way. so glad i got this. they didn't even make me remove it while it went through the security scanners like others mentioned. however, we were fine with reattaching it as we just needed to get our baby's car seat and the baby on move.
this is a nice set that would make a nice baby shower gift or a gift for a new mom. it comes with bottles of different sizes, including one with handles. it also comes with a few pacifiers and brush and a formula set. since new moms often need a variety of bottles, this is a nice set for the kids.<br /><br />it is bpa free, which is important. i found the quality to be very was easy for the baby to drink from. i like the blue color - i thought it made it pretty and would be good for a little boy baby (although it's obviously fine for girls as well). i like how much came with this set. this also is made to grow with the child.
We originally bought a tabby kitten wubbanub so it would be easier to find at night than the smaller pacifiers we had been using. My baby took to it so well that it became the only one she wanted. So we chose the pink elephant for an extra pacifier. She loves them both equally and both are really cute. It's not hard to spot clean the animal part & wash the pacifier part. At 2 months baby would sometimes get ahold of the legs & pull it out of her mouth to her dismay but now at 3 months she can grab ahold of it & stick it into her mouth if she wants. She also likes just holding onto the toy part. Highly recommend this pacifier.
I've been watching my sister's newborn for the summer and this has been more than a stress reliever for me. I don't know what is is but as soon as I put the pacifier in his mouth, if I turn for a second -- it's on the floor. With the pacifier tree, I just put a bunch in, nuke 'em, keep some distilled water nearby, dip them, and pop them right back in to the lil' bundle of joy's mouth. I have to say, when I had my triplets, I wish I would have known about this product! It is easy to keep clean. I even dropped it and it didn't break! I can't recommend this enough, if you want an extra bit of time saving along with peace of mind.
Why are people giving this dresser a bad review?  I ordered this dresser over a year ago for myself (not a child) because of the price (I'm on a tight budget). I wasn't really sure what to expect when I ordered it considering the low price (my old dresser had cost almost as much as this dresser and had been made of very cheap materials) so I was pleasantly surprised when I received it.  The dresser wasn't difficult to assemble. It's very nice looking (my old dresser looked cheap), it's very sturdy (my old dresser wasn't), and the drawers have plenty of space for my clothes (socks, underwear, pajamas, t-shirts, light sweaters).
After searching everywhere and ordering wrong flat tip nuk ones I nailed it. I ordered two packs and got luck the colors where 3 greens and 1 blue thank god since I have a boy I was afraid of getting a girl colored one. I think what helped amazon sort out the right colors was I also included in my order a pacifier clip with the colors green and blue so they probably matched it. Keep that in mind if u order these pacifiers since you can't choose the colors order something else with them with the color gender of you child it might help the person who's picking out your items in wear house. It helped in my case. Thank you amazon.
My daughter loves these and so do I. She has chubby cheeks and all he other pacifiers leave marks on her face but these ones do not. She has taken them so well I bought some for my nephew, who did not take a pacifier well and he really liked them also. They have now made the switch also. One WARNING though is that as they get older my daughter  (7 months) who will only take the 0-6 pacifiers likes to chew on the sides and at times has even put almost the whole pacifier in her mouth. Because it is flexible she is able to get it all the way in, because of this we don't let her take it to bed anymore. Other than that we love them!
[[videoid:be4b19e8c85d0d4abe41f0ce4c383081]]just what i needed to keep all of my babies memories safe. this is a cute plastic case that closes to open it you have to press the button. it comes with a memory book, files, information cards and labels. the memory book has pages for special dates/events/ocassions so all you have to do is fill it in i like that it has lil envelopes to keep important documents you want to save. the files can be used for vaccination records, insurance papers, ect. nice for keeping all of babies things in one place. i received this product at a discounted price or free, in exchange for my honest review.
my husband wanted to put our kids in a booster since they have outgrown their current carseats while in their winter coats - we can't buckle the seats without crushing them. i refused and was so passionate about keeping them in a 5 point harness that i wound up yelling at him with tears for all the little kids who have lost their lives while being in a booster. our kids are 5.5 years old and small. they are about 33 lbs. and 40 inches so lean but too tall now for the toddler seats. thank you to all the families who have shared their stories and helped educate the rest of us. and thank you britax for making this amazing car seat.
It's always hit or miss with pacifiers, as your little one my or may not like theirs for no discernible reason. That said, the Munchkin Latch Lightweight has a lot going for it. First, it's one piece and easy to clean. Second, the shape is curved near the baby's nose to help him breath. Third, they are very well priced!<br /><br />At first, I thought it a negative that the pacifier didn't have a handle, but I've read that this is because they are made for babies that can't reach the handle themselves. Still, it might be of benefit to a parent. But I've found that putting your pinkie in the nipple hole for removal does just fine.
These are good pacifiers.  My baby is iffy about taking a paci.  Sometimes she hates them and sometimes she needs one to help calm her down.  Of the several different brands of pacifiers we bought her, this is the one that tends to soothe her the best and she sucks on the longest.  As a parent, I like that I can just pop it in her mouth in either way...because of the shape of the nipple, there is no correct up or down which makes it easier to return to baby in a hurry after she knocks it out before she can start crying.  I also like the colors... the white pacifier is actually clear, the only part that is white is the middle nub.
We received a frog version of this pacifier for my son's baby shower and he loved it so much that I purchased this puppy for a friend's baby shower. I bought the puppy version for my son as well. He rotates between the frog, puppy and now a WubbaNub monkey.  I like that it is much easier to find and keep track of than other pacifiers. I can find it in the dark in his crib. It is easy for the baby to hold on to as well. As he's grown older, my son alternates using it as a pacifier and a stuffed animal for cuddling. When he's too old for pacifiers, I might cut the pacifier off and he can continue to have his little friend with him!
The Womb Sounds Bear has put my little boy to sleep numerous times. I really think the rhythmic sound it emits helps him relax and think he is in the womb again. Most of the time I put him down when he is sleepy to begin with, but the womb sounds bear has helped him to go back to sleep if he is waking up, having a hard time drifting off, or being generally grumpy. The sound is fairly soothing, you can adjust the volume, and it even has an automatic timer that makes it shut off after 40 minutes! Myself and my husband have both laughed, saying that it has helped US to go to sleep when it is on. Great buy for new moms or for a gift.
My daughter wanted to constantly use me as her pacifier and I tried every pacifier in the store but she wouldn't latch on to any of them for more than a few seconds. I read the reviews and decided to order a few of these so that maybe I could get a few hours of sleep instead of having her 'nurse' off me all night. They worked wonders! These are the only pacifiers she will use. They are lightweight, which is great b/c they're less likely to wake her up by falling out of her mouth once she's asleep. Plus they are very bendable so if she is asleep on her side they won't put too much pressure on her little face. Thanks Hawaii Medical!
This has been a lifesaver for us! I've seen a ton of moms and babies with these but didn't know what they were called. A friend had twins and said they couldn't do it without the Wubbanub. We soon learned the only pacifier our daughter liked was an Avent soothie but she would drop it at night. After a few nights of screaming after she knocked it out of her mouth (on purpose?), we sent Grammie and Pop Pop to find a Wubbanub. They brought us &#34;Lamby&#34;. I love the little cross on it. It reminds me to thank God for our precious blessing and she loves it. She actually holds it herself but it can be tucked into a swaddle or shirt.
although this blanket appears to be pricey, i personally think that it is worth every penny. my daughter loves this blanket. i bought it for her when she was a new born. i have found it to be a great year-round blanket. now at 18 months of age, my daughter is in love with this blanket and drags it around like linus from the peanuts.  we own many different types of blankets, but i would have to say that i wish that i just had two of these and none of the others.<br /><br />the blanket breathes well. because of its insulating properties, it is cool enough in a blistering summer, and adds just enough warmth during the winter as well.
this is a lightweight diaper cover.  i have not had any leaks, but let me tell you how i stuff them which may be the key.  i use the gerber prefolds which tend to be a but long and bulky in the center.  i fold the excess in the front since my baby tends to wee upword (if you are not sure where the excess is use a disposable and check to see where the concentration of urine is-this will help you not to have leaks and better help you stuff your diapers to meet your needs/also how she is laid to sleep).  please be advised that i use many different types of diapers and different stuffing to meet the need. that has led to much success.
Nicu pacifier she was given..funny thing is that u cant find these orange ones anywhere in stores. I bought all the other gumdrop colors, but she would not take them. I discovered the silicone was harder on the other gum drop pacifiers. I really paniced because I lookes everywhere for these orange ones and couldnt find them so I was very happy I found on amazon, now that I am down to my last one.  These are great and she loves the softer silicone..so, if your baby is pacifier specific, dont waste your money on all the other colors like I did, if baby was given and uses the orange, purchase the orange because there is a difference.
My almost-three year old daughter has slept with this cute bear since the day she was born!  It is perfect!  The volume can be adjusted, it shuts off automatically after 40 minutes, and it fits snugly to the side of the crib with a velcro strap so that it cannot possibly be removed by infants.  Now that she's a big kid in a big kid bed, she still falls asleep to the soothing sounds, but she also likes to carry the bear around and play with him.  The heartbeat sound the bear makes sounds just like what you hear through the Doppler at the OB's office!  Our little boy is due in 3-1/2 weeks, and we have a bear on the way for him, too!
So, I bought these when I was expecting my daughter (who is almost three), and we still use them as a teether when she needs to chew on something - she's a slow teether. She unfortunately never took a pacifier of any brand, but she loves chewing on these. They are super durable and don't show signs of breaking or cracking. These were undoubtedly the best teether we have, and i love that they are super non-toxic.     I sometimes smear a little toothpaste on them, and let her chew on them while we're winding down for her nap. While it doesn't replace a good brushing I think I does help clean her teeth without the tooth brushing fuss.
My son loves the Soothie Pacifier!  I am so glad I found these yellow pacifiers because there are literally 6 other kids at his daycare that have the green or blue soothie pacifier.  It is so hard for the teachers to keep the pacifiers straight with so many kids having the same one.  This yellow pacifier just solved the problem for me!  I am so happy!  I highly recommend this pacifier.  I have been told that breastfed babies prefer the shape of this pacifier - my son was breastfed and he would not take the other shaped paci's, so that could be true?  I'm not sure - all I know is that this pacifier is the only brand my son will use.
as a first time mommy i could not of asked for a better monitor! it allows me to do housework without having to run into the nursery every two mixtures.  we have been using it for a little over a week and not had one false alarm. our son's bassinet has a vibration option to help him sleep and we thought the monitor wouldn't work when the vibration was on since the bassinet was vibrating but my husband forgot to put the monitor on hold before picking our son up when the bassinet was vibrating and the monitor still sounded the alarm when it didn't detect our son breathing! i love this monitor!!!! it's a most have for any mom or dad!!!
I'm glad I chose the Mam pacifiers. Of course, every baby has a different preference on the shape. My baby is now 9 months old and still happily uses the 0-6 months pacifier. One of the best things about the pacifiers is the little plastic case they come in; the case is used to sanitize the pacifiers in the microwave. You fill with water to a line and microwave for three minutes. I sanitize the pacifiers every night while I'm doing things around the kitchen. In nine months I have not seen any buildup or mold on the inside of the pacifiers. I know other pacifiers have issues with buildup, so I feel like I made a good buying decision!
My son loves these pacifiers! When he was newborn, I could spread the legs out on top of his little swaddled body and it would help keep the pacifier in his mouth and help him find it again easily before he was able to use his hands. In the Car, it is MUCH easier to find when you can't see (for example, searching the crib in a dark room or with one hand reaching to carseat in the back while driving). He did go through a short phase when he was learning to grasp where he would pull it out of his mouth and not be able to get it back in, but as he got older it because much easier for him to put these back in at night without waking up.
I have many different brands of mesh feeders and this is one of my favorite!  My 7 month old absolutely loves it! He gets super excited when he sees this and puts it right into his mouth and starts sucking away! We have tried many different fruits, vegetables,  and even meats in this product and all work great! Unlike my other feeders this one has a lid and this means no mess in my diaper bag! The only problem I had is that it is a little hard to open but this also means there is no way baby can get it apart. I've had all of his grandparents and great grandparents state how ingenious this product is and how they wish they had these!
I bought this for my son and he loves his wubbanub! We don't go anywhere without it. It makes it much easier for him to hold his pacifier in. Before we got this, he didn't quite know how to hold those soothie pacifiers in his mouth. They would fall on the floor a lot and bounce/roll off under the couch or other pieces of furniture, then we would have to spend a few minutes just to find it this wubbanub is perfect for keeping the paci in one place if he does happen to drop it (which doesn't happen as often anymore). They are easy to clean, I just throw his in the washer and it comes out like new, the I lay it on a flat surface to dry.
Very convenient for newborns who aren't able to hold the pacifier in themselves. My daughter has Down Syndrome, which tends to be associated with low muscle tone, making it a little more challenging to maintain her hold on the pacifiers. This was really helpful in keeping the pacifier in for her, which also led to her muscle tone improving thanks to basically working out her muscles by sucking on the pacifier. It was very handy in the NICU, by holding the pacifier in for her when someone wasn't able to physically pop it back in her mouth. It's also been convenient in her car seat, when I am not able to help hold her pacifier for her.
my daughter got her bunny at one year and still loves it now nearly 6years later. this is hands down the best quality stuffed animal for a young child. it weathers many washings while retaining its softness. i have looked for a cat of this quality for my younger daughter who adores kitties and have had to buy several cats because they just don't last the way this bunny does. even though my daughter doesn't sleep with her bunny every night anymore, she still goes on all trips and gets dressed in lots of different outfits (other doll clothes fit!) and we have fun sewing our own dresses for the bunny! this is a purchase you won't regret.
My son loves this pacifier! He has been using it since we got it (he was 8 weeks). At first he could care less about the dinosaur attached and was just interested in the pacifier, but now he loves that he can grab it and move it around.  He doesn't have the ability to put a small pacifier in his mouth yet, but with the dinosaur he can hold it much easier.  I also love it because if you lay the dino on him or a surface with the pacifier in his mouth it doesn't fall out so easily as the pacifier alone.  A great help for when he wakes up when the pacifier falls out! Overall we find it so adorable and helpful - it goes everywhere with us!
...Aren't these just the cutest!! I have a 7 month old son and these binkies made the perfect photo op! He doesn't care for binkies but he managed to keep these in his mouth the longest of any other brand I've tried. (I'm thinking it's the fabulous mustache!) I love that they came with a case so they are easy to travel and you don't have to worry about what might get stuck on them while in the diaper bag or purse. I bought the one black and one brown set- the brown matched his blonde color hair the best, but the black is great too for photos! These would make a great gift for a new little one and surely make a baby a perfect gentleman!
I wasn't sure what to expect when purchasing these, but they are absolutely fabulous! No more feeling like you're putting chemicals into your child's mouth. I also love how easy they are to wash! The little loop on the end is also quite hady, especially when you're out and about and baby doesn't want the pacifier. Ours have gotten a little darker with time, but they still look as new otherwise. I can't say enough about these! I felt so confident using these and will recommend them to anyone - especially breast feeding mothers as I think these resemble a mother's nipple more than any other ones I've seen! Great product - worth the cost!
I guess it's hard to review pacifiers, as reviewers tend to focus on whether or not their child liked the pacifier when giving stars. I give the MAM pacifiers 5 stars unequivocally, regardless of whether my baby liked them or not, because they are well made with a child's oral health in mind. My toddler has been using MAM pacifiers since she was 3 months old. We tried every pacifier on the market and she could not keep the pacis in her mouth at that age. The MAM worked from the start and we haven't looked back. They tend to be more expensive (per piece) than other pacifiers but I guess price isn't an issue if your baby likes this paci!
We have a box full of pacifiers for our 2 month-old daughter, and one NUK Genius we received as a shower gift... and, of course, it's the NUK Genius (the *one* pacifier that we are unable to find at any of our local stores) that she truly loves. We recently (temporarily) lost our only NUK Genius pacifier, and were forced to order another on Amazon, balking slightly at the $5 price... but with her stubborn insistence, we went ahead and ordered it, deciding that $5 is not so much $$ for household peace...    We found the original pacifier we already owned, so now we have two, and are already considering buying a few more... just in case.
My wife and I received this product for review with our beautiful 5 month old daughter. I was so excited when it arrived that i wanted to call in sick the next day at work so i could just make bottles! This thing lives up to its name... genius! Finally, we got to cut out the formula making bottle prepping hassle that we had to deal with every night.<br />My only recommendation would be to add a feature that mixes the formula and water together. My daughter suffers severe reflux and very gassy. So when we shake the bottle after it's made, we end up having to skim the bubbles off the top to prevent her gas.<br />Overall, AWESOME PRODUCT!
light and easy to put on the table or take off with one hand. small enough to fit in the diaper bag and sturdy enough to hold my 2 year old. be careful, it does not fit all tables. we have run across problems with tables that have a lip, and sometimes tables in restaurants are just too thick. but this has been only a few times. prepare for a lot of comments! everyone walking by your table will say how cool they think it is and what a great idea.     we purchased this item in 2004 and are still using it, now for our second child. i have purchased one for 3 of my other friends who eat out a lot. keeps baby right up at the table with you.
amazing cup!!! i have been really over using my daughters straw cups and losing all the pieces or trying to keep them clean and wanted something spill proof but simpler and i stumbled across these!! omg i cant say enough good about them!! easy to clean and use, my daughter is 2 and was a little confused at first but picked it up quickly! they are 100% spill proof and after a week of use, so far i have nothing but great things to say about them! they have been dropped, washed in the dishwasher, and every other day to day use and so far holding up very well with my destructive toddler! you wont be disappointed! i just ordered 3 more!! :)
My daughter wanted to constantly use me as her pacifier and I tried every pacifier in the store but she wouldn't latch on to any of them for more than a few seconds.  I read the reviews and decided to order a few of these so that maybe I could get a few hours of sleep instead of having her 'nurse' off me all night.  They worked wonders!

Plus they are very bendable so if she is asleep on her side they won't put too much pressure on her little face.  Thanks Hawaii Medical!
when my son started being able to stand up in his crib, i knew the mobile we had hanging wasn't going to last. i wanted something that would help him learn that its ok to be on his back in his crib. this is the perfect solution. the only negative i have found is that i wish the images rotated. i have it hanging on the side of his crib, and the images are sideways. i could move it to the top of his dresser so that the images are showing the right way, but i don't think he much cares. he loves to push the light button and has figured out how to stand up and turn it on on his own. the music is the right volume and lasts long enough for us.
My son tried 6 different pacifier brands and this was the only one he would use. I've purchased close to 100 of them in the last year, since we lose them like crazy. Sigh. Anyway, when he needs a pacifier, it's desperate, so we have them all over the house now. I like that these are mostly clear, so we can still see his happy little smirk through the pacifier. And they aren't too distracting in photos, etc. They come in a variety of colors, and we have just about every one of them. I would definitely recommend them, however, it's really up to your baby and their preference. The pricing on Amazon is pretty consistent with Target pricing.
this diaper bag is the perfect transition for a. my other diaper bag that finally bit the dust with a broken zipper and b. it's a convenient size that is small enough but enough room to fit a few cloth diapers, straw sippy cup in front, wipes, wet bag, shoes, extra set of clothes and snacks! also, bonus! it has strap loops on the sides so i just attached the strap from my old bag and ouila! it's a messenger bag. but the straps on the bag itself are a great length as well. i'm very happy with this bag and the price isn't too bad either as it can double for traveling later. :) plus the print is just on point. even better than the picture.
I got the little blue monkey. At first I thought it was too lightweight as I used to put it on my baby's chest while lying flat on his back, but it kept on falling off. Then one day by chance my baby's face was tilted to the side and the monkey fell on one side and found out that that way it works better! Basically when baby's face is on the side while lying in bed you just put the monkey lying close to him (not parallel) putting the paci in baby's mouth, The paci stayed in his mouth and even if it came out my baby was able to pull it back in most of the times. I still would have preferred it if the hands and feet were slightly heavier.
I loved these pacifiers!  They are the best pacifiers!  My baby was breastfeed and I found these and they are great.  They actually simulate a nipple and move back and forth as the child is sucking.  So they are wonderful.  I have tried all the other pacifiers and my baby still seems to like this best of all.  Only trouble is stores have discontinued them...soo now you can only find them online.  So be prepared to order a few at a time!  Some folks say they have found mold in them.  I disinfect my nipples and pacifiers in boiling water every week and have found no sign of that!  These are a terrific product. I give it a 10 star in my book!
we all love this toy. when someone presses the orchestra button, a new song starts. then you can add or subtract instruments. it's great for teaching about different parts (harmony/melody/counterpoint), different sounds, and some classical music. or just listening to and playing with!  we've had ours for about 5 years now, and although it has been subjected to four rough and tumble kids, it still works well. it has been dropped, and even though the battery cover piece broke, we got a replacement through the company and it's back in use. our current 2 year old particularly likes to drum along with it. loudly. repeatedly.   rhythm, right? :)
i got tired of the poor quality ingredients in over priced squeeze pouches, but loved the convenience of being able to pass my busy 18 month old something nutritious that he could feed himslef. but what i really wanted was to use food i made... and found these. now after i make my smoothie in the morning i poor some into one of these for him and pass it along to him to eat while i finish getting ready. yeh!  i can even hide green ingredients in here without him suspecting.  they will leak if he throws it on the floor from his highchair, but can't blame the product.  much easier to wash than i would have guessed.  best baby find of the year.
I bought this for my son who is 15 months old because he would wake up every night at 3am and want to eat. Not only did we want to break him of this habit and get him to learn to self sooth without a bottle in the middle of the night, we didn't want to do any damage to his teeth with milk. We tried water but he hated that too. He has never been a binky kid but I was willing to try anything and this has been awesome. He puts the pacifier in his mouth and then he holds the animal the way that he would normally hold a bottle. The animal is so soft and cuddly too. It has worked great for us and he really seems to like this. I highly reccommend.
this product is super efficient! firstly its small enough to fit in my fashionable work bag. 2. the silicone cup makes it softer on the breasts. 3. it's easily assembled/disassembled. 4. it's quiet. 5. got the bottle with the little graphics on it. 6. because the first pull can feel a little strong, i just gently squeeze the lever until my breasts are accustomed and gradually increase pull.7. works on pure suction so i can temper the force of the pull. 8. did i say little and cute? i really appreciate the thought put into its design. i've heard, and still hear horror stories about the manual pump but i have not experienced it. thanks nuk!!!
i love this wall decal in my daughter's room!  it looks so absolutely adorable, and it sticks to the wall very well.  we actually just went through a move, and with smart packing this decal was easy to re-stick to a new wall!  my daughters room was boring and white, but we lived in a rental so i could not do anything permanent to the walls.  after sticking this decal on the wall, my daughter's room had life!  i was so impressed with the difference it made, and i got tons of compliments from other mothers wondering where i got it.  i would recommend this product to anyone who wants their child's room to look like an adorable enchanted forest.
We love this bottle warmer.  I was a little skeptical about getting a bottle warmer after reading some of the reviews of the other brand names of warmers.  But I decided to go with this one since its reviews were good and I am so glad I did.  I love the automatic shut off function and the beep when it is finished.  Like anything else, you have to use good sense and adjust the amount of water according to how much in the bottle and check the temp before giving it to baby but I have easily learned to estimate the amount of water needed based on the amount in the bottle.  This is definitely something you will want if you are heating bottles !!!
After many attempts to find a pacifier that my son would take we settled on Tommee Tippee Closer to Nature. There is no upside down as with other brands as the symmetrical shape allows for your little one to put the pacifier in all by themselves with no fuss.  Now when someone gives him a different brand he immediately spits it out and reaches for this one.  The 0-6 months pacifiers were used constantly and we never had an issue with any of them wearing out or needing to be replaced.  The only downside is the cute designs on the face will scratch off between being placed in the dishwasher to clean and little fingers grasping for the pacifier.
we started using it when my daughter was newly born. at first we put a sponge foam on top to give her the soft support. not sure if it's necessary though, it's just my idea. when she reached 2 month, we removed sponge foam. now my daughter is 7 month, we're stil using it. the size fits her very well throughout the 7 months. she seems very comfy sitting in there and always has a wonderful time at bathing time. it's also very durable, easy to clean. after 7 month's use, it still looks like new! my daughter is at 97% height. from what it looks, we can continue using this one until she can sit in the big real tub by herself! definitly a good buy!
i've been putting my son on this mat since he was a month old and the colours and sounds endlessly entertain him.  he plays and gives his parents time to get things done around the house for half an hour at a time, and the mirror encourages him to push his head up during tummy time.  it's easily washed, which is handy because i almost always have spit up on it.  the music isn't too loud or too quiet, though there is no volume control, and the batteries don't last very long, but then again, my son insists on having the music on all the time when playing on it.  definitely recommended to any parent desperate for a little time to get things done!
i ordered both the toddler pillow and the toddler pillow case.  both are really great.  i am a senior citizen and since my hip replacement surgery i sleep best in my recliner.  i ordered the pillow (and case) for my own use.  i love the way my head sinks into the center of this luxurious little pillow prohibiting my head to fall to one side or another during a deep sleep.  misalignment of head and shoulders during the night was causing me neck problems which led to vertigo (a rather frightening malady).  the fabric and general construction of these items is top notch.  i plan to purchase a second pillow case.  the size is perfect for my needs.
this monitor is the best! i really love the fact that both units can be cordless, the baby unit is rechargable, the range is amazing, and it is so clear that you can easily hear the baby breathing! after four years and two kids (and some seriously hard wear and tear) we needed to replace ours and went with another brand because of some extra little features that sounded fun. i could not believe how horrible it was in comparison! (it was safety 1st by the way.) i realized that the silly features some monitors offer are useless if overall the product doesn't work. needless to say we are returning it and going with what we know is tried and true.
I love these so much that I even sent some to my friend back home in the UK because she thought the big American Soothie pacifiers looked ridiculous, and couldn't believe they would make one that would cover a baby's nose. Anyway, I think they are wonderful. Exact same nipple shape as the Soothie, but with room to breathe! My son doesn't have a problem with them either. I particularly like that, with this particular nipple shape, he doesn't really hold onto it for too long, and just sucks until he's pacified then spits it out. I don't foresee pacifier addiction in our future. Can't recommend it highly enough, and this is the best price around!
We love wubbanubs! I didn't want to use pacifiers with my first born, but after 2 nights of screaming in the hospital I gave in, so her first paci was a soothie. When we got home, we started using the wubbanub and my daughter learned how to push the paci back in her mouth in just a couple months. The stuffed animal has also saved us from dropping wubbanub on the ground numerous times, since there is something to catch or sometimes get stuck on something else. We washed it in the laundry with natural detergent and let it air dry and never had any problems. We give these as gifts to our new mom friends now and no one leaves home without the Wub.
This pacifier fits perfectly in my grandson's tiny mouth,  and he took to it instantly.  There is no gagging,  and the fit appears to be natural.  He goes to town on them while at the same time looking irresistibly adorable.<br /><br />BPA free and dishwasher safe, I appreciate the fact that they are made of silicone making them more sanitary and less apt to incubate bacteria.<br /><br /> We are extremely pleased with the Munchkin Latch pacifiers.  There really is no need to look further for a pacifier because this one is sanitary, economical and simply works!<br /> I wish we could purchase a dozen in different colors to match his cute outfits!
My 9 month old son absolutely LOVES this pacifier. I bought the doggie one for him when he was 5 months old and added the giraffe and dinosaur to his collection a couple of months later. These pacifiers have been of great help to us because my baby wakes up several times during the night looking for his pacifier. Most of the time, he wasn't able to find or grasp the regular pacifiers, so he would start crying and we would have to get up and help him. Since we bought these pacifiers, we don't have to get up anymore. He finds them quickly and can easily put them on. Sometimes, we find him asleep with two pacifiers on at the same time, super cute!
when my two year old got to long for her toddler bed we went and ordered the metal bed rails that slide under the mattress that was a disaster !!!!!! we then started looking at this product and decided to give it a try . we are sooo glad we did !!!!!! this in an absolute amazing product nooo metal bars , no worrying about your child falling between the matress and the bed rail, and sooo easy to make the bed. the only thing i would caution people on is to make sure your sheets are very tight, we put ours on under her matress protector and my 210pd. husband can move all around and they will not move!!!!!! sum up-great product highly recommend !!!
I had purchased these at Target for my now 6yr old son when he was an infant. I loved them very much. when i got pregnant again I couldn't find them in any store and was very disappointed. However i found them on amazon and ordered them without any question. Received the same great product as before just a different look. me son was born early and is a little small so st first he chocked on them so we had to use a smaller different brand however at 4 months he has started taking them and seems to like them. I like these the best because they don't leave that awful ring around there mouth and the saliva doesn't lay there and cause an awful rash.
i am really glad i made the switch from plastic bpa free bottles to glass.  the glass bottles keep the milk from spoiling longer and are very easy to clean vs plastic.  not to mention safer for your child.  i have droped the bottle several times, with the cover on, and the bottle did not break.  the outer covers are bright and beautifull.  worth the money.  i just wish i got these when i had my first child.  i guess one draw back is the 9 oz size is a little heavy for my 9 month old to hold but they do make a smaller size.  also the nipples collapse and do not vent but i think you could purchase different nipples.  these are not problems for me.
I absolutely love this stroller (I have red). As a previous reviewer noted, it's easy to assemble. It's also light, very easy to manoeuvre, and my son is comfortable in it. As an avid runner, I bought one for my first son because I was very eager to get back out there. This stroller made it easy and I was back in shape in no time. I'm expecting my second son in a few weeks and would have bought a double jogger from Baby Jogger but was generously given a Bob Revolution Duallie. It's gotten great reviews, too, but I loved this stroller so much I was almost disappointed. We'll see! I HIGHLY recommend this stroller. It is definitely worth the price.
I just received this bumper, i loved.first i got scared with the size, because even if you know the mesure before buy you would be waiting for something smaller.anyway is very good thing, i personaly put the two pieces together under the shhetsto make it longer on the edge of my soon's bed, is so confortable, not hard,no smells,and keeps the sahpe even if you seat on top of, like i do sometimes to read to my soon.i use to have pillow under his sheets and still worry that he could fall of the bed, but now i can sleep with no worries, he is well protected and confortable...i think this could be covered with some kind of fabric to be over perfect..
I love this item. It was so easy & quick to use which is a must for any new parent. The built in fill line is very convenient. Everything can be done with one hand from filling water, to putting the cover on, dumping water afterwards, and taking the top off.<br /><br />I also like the paci hanger & it worked with my Soothie pacificiers that have no ring (just slip Soothie hole onto tree arm & it fits). I also like how the pacifiers do not sit in the water but instead hang up to sterilize, avoiding potential for water to seep into nipple & stay). Lastly, the fact that it sterilizes in 60 seconds and is very small & compact for storage is awesome!
these bags are perfect if you use 100% biodegradable diapers... yes they do exist!! check out the bamboo diapers here on amazon, the owner will even send you a trial if requested. the diapers are so amazingly soft, plush, and effective that i sort of wish i still peed my pants.<br /><br />but yeah, these bags are a great accompaniment because we can throw our diapers in a biodegradable bag, throw it into the trashcan for the garbage men to pick up and without any special effort we are saving the world!!<br /><br />(sidenote - the bamboo diapers are quite expensive, but i think it is worth it considering the economic impact of disposable diapers)
the microphone windscreens were as good as expected for the price. they fit my microphones which are sure mic's without any hassle of tearing when being applied. the fit is a snug fit which is important for proper use. i would recommend buying this product highly. however, if you're lacking in patients, the delivery is slow. this product is being shipped on a slow boat from overseas so don't expect a fast and timely delivery. if you pay for expedited shipping then the cost savings is out the window. order before you need them and this way your money will be well worth it...<br />bottom line, yes i would recommend this product.<br /><br />t wright
This cow is much softer than my other Wubbanub that's a lamb.  It is like a velour fabric.  My only complaint is that the cow I received did not have black feet like I expected from the photo.  Maybe it's just a coincidence that the cow in this picture has its spots right on each of its feet.  Wubbanubs are awesome!  I never have pacis dropped on the floor and my little girl loves to hold onto it.  I have also washed it in a mesh lingerie bag and it washed up great!  Just have to let it air dry which didn't take long at all.  I actually gave it to my daughter still damp straight from the wash and she didn't have a problem with it!  Great product.
these letter/numbers are great. my two year played with them for the first time yesterday in the shower. they stick easily on both glass and porcelain on both sides so he could easily put them wherever he wanted using either side. the bag is great and keeps the letters from ending up all over the place. my only minor complaint is that the draw string closes pretty easily and was hard for my toddler to get the letters in the bag without some help. i don't know that there is anything that can be done about that and in the end it's extremely minor. all in all some great toys. can't wait to work on spelling and letter recognition with him in the bath.
3.5 year old twins going on vacation....we purchased these specifically for ease of travel for the airport.  we have a bag to gate check our car seats and wanted to downsize to 1 bag through the airport.  the seats were compact enough to fit, easy to put together and easy for our girls to use when in the car.  our girls enjoyed being in a big kid seat while still remaining safe.  i was leary about them unbuckling when the car was moving but they were very respectful of their new freedom.  these boosters are slender enough that 3 will fit across the 1 row in our everyday car for transporting them and an older brother.  very happy with our purchase.
My breast fed baby will ONLY take these.  I wasted a lot of money on several brands of pacifier and gave up, thinking my baby just wouldn't take one.  My niece was born the following week, and one night in the middle of the night I was messaging with my sister-in-law and she messaged me a picture of the MAM, the pacifier that my niece had started taking reliably.  I thought, whatever, it probably still won't work, but we bought some anyway, and lo and behold!!!  So now we have three sets, pink, yellow, and the green glow in the dark.  We also have the 6 mos ones in a drawer ready to go, which are the same but with a longer nipple.  Love our MAM!!!
This is the second one I am buying just so we have an extra around the house! My daughter not only loves the pacifier attatched to it but she likes to hold the animal attatched... it provides extra comfort! They are totally worth the buy! & if the animal gets dirty you can just throw it in the washing machine and it comes out clean and even softer! I can't say enough great things about this product! Just for safety do not let your baby fall asleep with it in the crib and unwatched because it's not safe to have stuffed animals by your babies face... it's best if they are in a chair/swing/bouncy/car seat using it! but seriously a incredible product!
Absolutely our favorite pacifiers. Have you seen the pacifiers that have rubber wraps to the handle? Yeah, try cleaning those and they will become water logged...which leads to mold. These prevent that as it is all one piece basically. They work with Paci clips really well (both the ones made for these by the same company and even generic or diy paci clips like on etsy.) ...actually I like the diy ones better as they loop around and cannot be yanked out by the babe.  if registering for these, I would put at least 6 pairs on it. Cheap great add on item for guests to buy you and you really will need them all when you realize how easily they are lost.
No need to constantly reposition Soothie pacifier in baby's mouth every 5 seconds or chase it across the room when it rolls away, and its easy to find! My baby has loved it from day 1 at age 3 weeks, and it is a source of curiousity and amazement among adults and other parents. It really does help baby get the pacifier in his mouth on his own and makes it available to him if you're not there to give it to him (eg when riding in the car, Clifford the dog sits on his chest and he tilts his head forward and grabs the paci with his mouth). Excellent product! I hand wash with my bras in a natural detergent, wrings out fast. Looks adorable in photos too.
i researched bibs quite extensively and had to look hard to find this.  i finally choose it b/c of the fact that it wrapped around the child's body prohibiting them pulling it over their head (which happens a lot!).  it is adjustable and is so easy to clean and unlike other bibs.  going to restaurants and worrying about extra messes is no longer an issue because it can be wiped down quickly and stored cleanly in the diaper bag.  i've had several comments that people are impressed with the bib.  i just went to amazon to purchase several for shower gifts and was extremely disappointed to find that they are no longer in stock. i hope this changes soon.
when i first started pumping, i cut holes into an old sports bra to use as a pumping bra. it worked but it was super annoying to use at work (who wants to pull a sports bra on and off two to three times a day at work?). i'm so glad i ended up buying this. it zips up, so i don't have to pull off my shirt or my regular nursing bra to get it positioned. the sizing is adjustable--that's why you buy the size s-xl. there's an adjustable panel on the back so it can fit just about any size. i am currently about a 36b/ 36c (depending on the bra brand--this is my nursing bra size). this fits great and really does allow me to do other things while i'm pumping.
our son loves this. sometimes he will be fighting to stay awake & we turn this on the ocean & he instantly calms. the batteries last a long time too. we leave it on for all this naps (which equals out to about 7hrs a day) and have only had to change the batteries once in three months. my only issue is we bought the plug in version too (green with the projector) and the ocean sound isn't the same.  at night, we would have to lay this in his crib to get him to sleep while the plug in was also playing and eventually remove this one. worth the trouble, but kind of a pain. we bring this every where though and it really does help him relax & get to sleep.
This is the only kind of pacifier my daughter will take. We offered her a pacifier very early on (she was only a couple weeks old), and this was the only kind she would use. I love the different designs they have and the fact that it is an orthodontic nipple. Someone gave us a pacifier clip of another brand, but it still fit because the rubber ring fits easily around the nob. I strongly recommend a clip to go with it to keep one attached to the car seat. Now that she is a little older, my daughter still uses these little ones, but she also has the Mam teether pacifiers and LOVES them. Now, I always get these as a gift for my friends having a baby :)
I received some Mam pacifiers as a baby shower gift.  They were 6m+ so when he was 6 months I washed them up and tried one.  He had been liking the Avent pacifiers so I didn't expect him to like these large, oddly shaped pacifiers- but he loved them!  I wasn't even sure what brand they were, so I asked around, and my day care provider knew it was a Mam.  I ordered more and he they are his faves!  He prefers over Avent and Nuk.  I read reviews and many other reviewers said their babies really liked these when they were teething.  Mine is definitely teething.  I'm not sure if that is why he likes them, or if its something else, but I swear by them now.
i've been eye-balling the meitai carrier style for a while now. i've, thus far, been using ring slings and baby wraps which have been wonderfully versatile for my carrying needs. but i haven't quite managed successfully wrapping my baby in a back carry without help and on really hot days i dread having to be wrapped up in all that cloth. so this purchase has been great. i've only had it for two days but already i can see there is a lot more airflow so me and my baby don't overheat in the florida weather. also, i was able to quickly hoist up my baby into a back carry so i could get some house cleaning done. and my baby had fun in her new vantage point.
My daughter was always a bit of a pacifier addict but once we switched from Soothies to these at about 5 months, she didnt want to let them go. The other amazing thing is that with the loop on the back she can carry them around on her own very easily AND when she was smaller, the bulb style ones made it much harder for her paci to fall out and wake her up. My daughter is now 10 months old and has been through many of these. I know they aren't as cute in color but being natural and seeing how much she loves them has encouraged me to continue to purchase them. Now I just have to figure out how to get her to not want them anymore since she is almost 1 : (
I originally only got this because I liked the idea of a pacifier that would be harder to lose/easier for baby to grab and put in. I didn't expect my daughter to become so attached to it! It doesn't stay in perfectly, but a lot better than just a paci by itself, and you can swaddle it up inside a blanket to help secure it even more. My baby loved to hold it while she sucked on the pacifer and even when she stopped taking pacifiers altogether at about 2 1/2 months, she still loves this giraffe. She holds it while she sleeps, in the car, and now that she has started teething she loves to chew on his legs and horns. Great buy for as happy as it makes her!
Our first 3 kids didn't like pacifiers, but our new little one loves them! Especially this one. We adopted her and the cradle care family sent her to our home with this little giraffe, and it's been a great soother for our little one at night. I tried using a different pacifier and stayed awake for a very long time putting it back in her mouth. With the Wubbanub she puts it back in her mouth..even at 2 weeks old.  We also like that the part that goes in babies mouth stayes off surfaces (tables, etc) when you put it down. We find it easier to just hand wash and let air dry, especially since right now we only have one. Definatly a great baby shower gift.
the first thing i noticed was how soft it all was, right out of the packaging. i rarely write reviews but had to make sure to write one about this set. it was very soft, and i love the fact the top flat sheet has bottom edging so it doesn't just get kicked off by the little ones. almost like a half-fitted sheet, very nice. any kid that loves sesame street or elmo will love this set, my little man loves elmo and i love the fact one side of the pillow cover has a big picture of elmo (the other side is cookie monster) it is not all elmo though, so if you are looking for just him it's not for you. but there is sufficient elmo that my little guy loves it. :)
We weren't going to do the whole pacifier thing with our breastfed baby, but the hospital photographer showed us how well these Soothies worked and it was hard to argue with results. Our little one found suckling to be very soothing, but we soon found out she'd scream and squawk whenever she tossed the pacifier out of her mouth.<br /><br />The Wubbanub:<br /><br />1. Made her less likely to toss the pacifier onto the floor.<br />2. Protected the pacifier from actually touching the floor when she did throw it out.<br />3. Gave her a cute stuffed animal to touch, hold, and hug.<br /><br />I buy Wubbanubs for shower gifts for all my friends and family now.
These are our favorite, after trying a few different styles. Why?<br />* The shield curves away from the face on the whole outer edge, so this pacifier doesn't leave an imprint on our baby's face as many other pacifiers do (e.g. NUK pacifiers).<br />* Stays in her mouth better than Soothies.<br />* Comes with a cover that keeps the pacifier clean when it's stuffed in a pocket or in her diaper bag.<br />* It's reversible, unlike the NUKs, so it's never upside-down in her mouth.<br />* The loop handle makes it easier for adults to pick up. Unfortunately, it also makes it easier for our baby to pull out of her mouth by accident.<br />* BPA-free, of course.
At first glance, I thought that we were going to be overpaying for something we really needed. It turns out that these are definitely worth the cost though. In a house filled with hardwood floors, my kids are always falling forwards and slobbering all over the place. These mats provided a nice firm cushion that is easy to clean. It also makes the floors a little more comfortable when I'm down on the ground laying with them. The biggest benefit of all is that you can easily detach a small section and move it into another room if you need a quick temporary mat in there. I would highly recommend these to anyone who is not sure they want to spend the money.
i use these gates to block off the upstairs from the downstairs to keep my dogs seperated. one gate goes at the base of the stairs, and the other at the top. so far, i havent had any issues with the dogs knocking them over (i have one 80 lbs. pitbull, another 50 lbs. pit mix and a 12 lbs. jack russel). the only down side to these gates is that there is no door to bypass the gate through, so any time you would like to get past the gate, you either have to manuever over it or un-do the latch. i dont mind this though because i think that a gate with an accessible door would be less sturdy. we marked our latch spot with a permanent marker for quicker set-up.
If you have an infant, you need a Wubbanub!  I got my first Wubbanub for my son when he was about 6 weeks old.  Honestly, I wish I had it sooner.  This little guy sits perfectly on the baby's chest.  This, of course, leads to more peaceful naps as you are not summoned to find the paci in the middle of the night.  As my son grew, he could start to hold on to the frog part.  He loved it!  He is 8 1/2 months old now and still keeps a Wubbanub in his crib.  It is part stuffed animal, part paci and provides him much comfort through the night.  I wish I could buy these locally, but now that I know about them, I tell all my pregnant friends.  Love the Wubbanub!
i ordered the medium bag in outer space print.  it's the perfect size to throw in the diaper bag for an afternoon outing.  i can fit 6-ish diapers if i really stuff em in there when they are dirty.  the dimensions measure 15\\ tall and 12\\ wide. we have 3 planet wise wet bags and two pail liners and they all seem well made and hold up in the washer and dryer.  i just throw them in with my cloth diapers (both for wash and dry) and they do great.  they contain the stink well while out and about- my only problem is remembering to take the wet bag out of the diaper bag when i get home (finding the dirties days later in the diaper bag is a special treat lol!)
i love this bag! i travel extensively and was looking for a bag that was attractive, sturdy and had multiple accessible pockets. this bag is perfect! i've used it extensively for multiple trips. i love the bright colored, roomy interior, ample pockets, deep zippered front pockets, and open front pockets.  the aqua interior makes it easy to locate items and the deep pockets help keeps items separate and reachable. this bag easily holds multiple items, makes organizing a breeze and most importantly, it is very comfortable to carry. the straps are well-made and the width is perfect so it doesn't cut in to my shoulders.  i would buy this again in a heartbeat.
i ordered the basket shelf storage cubby with three baskets in espresso, along with the three bin storage cubby, for my toddler's room (to replace a set of six cubes she pulled down on top of herself--oops!).  these are sturdy, roomy, and look adorable in her room.  the reviews complaining about the quality and color of the \\wood\\ should have more reasonable expectations...you don't pay ikea prices to get pottery barn quality.  for the price paid, these are great quality, came well-packaged, were super easy to assemble (i assembled both pieces by myself within an hour) and do the job of storing books and toys in a kids' room.  and it looks great to boot!
we purchased this monitor when we found out that our preemie son would finally be going off his apnea monitor.  it was then that we realized that we wouldn't be able to sleep at night without it!  this monitor has given us peace of mind.  it's worked perfectly since we've gotten it, and we've had no false alarms in the 3 months since we've been using it.  it also works great for travel.  we put the movement sensor on the bottom of his pack 'n play right above the crossbars and below the mattress.  as the parent of a preemie who got \\spoiled\\ at night by the apnea monitor, this is the next best thing!  this is worth the price just for the movement sensor!
I have two pairs of these for my 5 month old. He loves them best! He likes to watch them glow in the mirror and sleeps with them until they pop out due to him sleeping with his mouth wide open. I wish I had these for my older children when they were infants. They're easy to find in a dark room or even a dark car. I love the brand of pacifier. It is the only kind my 3 children would use. The others were uncomfortable and made them cry. I didn't even bother trying any other brand with my youngest, but my husband did and regretted not listening. My husband will even  finds them amazing and helpful for when he gets up every so often to help my son fall asleep.
when i purchased this monitor, i was worried about the screen size. it is definitely not a problem. it is big enough that i can see everything clearly. the night vision is very clear. this monitor also has all the bells and whistles that i wanted: remote camera movement, intercom, good volume control, and ease of use. the only negative thing i have to say about it is the battery life. we always keep it on the charger at night anyways, and it lasts long enough to get me through household chores and other things of that nature. plus, the low battery warning is loud enough that you will know when to hook it up. this is a perfect video monitor for a good price.
i first bought this product 2 years ago when my daughter turned 2, she's now 4 and we still use it every day on our home table top.  her twin brothers have now turned 2 and i bought two more of them to use for their place setting as well.  i like it because it keeps plastic plates and bowls from sliding around and possibly falling on the floor.  my daughter's mat is over 2 years old and is strain and rip free.  only thing i don't like about the mat is the suction cups because it makes it hard to put an open cup right on the mat without having a spill.  overall, i really like the mat and we use it every day and it gets washed every day and still works great.
My son had a heart condition when he was born, so when he was released from the NICU he had to go to the cardiologists where he had many tests completed.  When we were there, they gave him a vanilla scented soothie.  While I personally hate the soothie since it covers up their entire face, it was a save all!  He was so angry at the doctors, that this calmed him right down.  By the end of his visit he was asleep.  When I researched the soothie, I came across these and so far he loves them.  For whatever reason he favors the blue over the orange, but loves them both.  When he's super fussy, we give him these and he tends to calm down faster. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!
i purchased this at a big chain store, because i had a gift-card. but i would've purchased through amazon.com, as i buy lots of stuff through amazon.com, and it is cheaper through amazon.com. i cannot recommend this product enough! i don't want the sun directly in my baby's face, and this does the job perfectly! i was, initially, aggravated that the product didn't come with instructions, but quickly realized there are endless ways of attaching it to your stroller, as every stroller is constructed differently. you can do an image search and find some suggestions, if you absolutely have no idea how to attach this to your stroller. you'll figure it out quickly.
we have had this monitor for about 3 months now.  we love it!  it is sensitive to pick up pretty much as much sound as you'd like.  the video is incredible.  even in a completely dark room, we can see our little one clear.  i'm not sure what the other reviewers are speaking about when they're describing the flashing led's.  we don't see any of this.  they just stay on with a very dull orange appearance.  the only negative (if you can say that) about the monitor is if you use the video a lot on just battery power, it drains them pretty quickly.  you need to use the video on/off button to take quick peeks and then you're fine.  highly recommend this monitor!!!
We've had Wubbanubs since our son was 3 months old, he's 8 months now and he loves them. The attached toys make the pacifiers easy to find and hold onto for us and for our baby. We like to keep one handy wherever we go: at home in the nursery or play area, in the car, in the diaper bag, and for daycare. If your baby uses Soothie pacifiers, this is an excellent addition  to your baby gear! Also a plus, Wubbanub  makes the red dog and yellow duck plush toys attached to a lovie-type blankie so when your ready to be rid of the pacifier, you can substitute the blankie and not take away your baby's favorite cuddle toys. I recommend this product to all new parents.
i got this back of bandana bibs for my then 6 month baby boy basically because he is a drooling machine and i was going thru 3 to 4 bibs a day, but i was not really happy with the quality and look of the regular bibs i was using. the bibs came securely packed and included a coupon to use in a next purchase. once i opened them i loved how vibrant the colors were and also how soft they were. i also liked a lot that they had two snap options so my baby could grow into them. he is 11 month and still uses them. i have to say that the quality of this product is great, i have wash them countless times and the colors and fabric still look the same. highly recommended
really awesome for any full sized adjustable headrest. didn't work on the middle seat of my honda van, the headrest was too small, but i installed it on the side seat (the seat beside where the car seat is installed). i do need to take it down if someone is sitting there, but it is quick and easy to install. my 1-year old likes to look in the mirror and see me, and it is plenty big. i can see her entire seat easily - no distortions, and it isn't too small. it will shake a tad when driving, but my main objective is to see if she was in distress, and i can see well enough. the angle adjusts well and stays put. much better than other mirror options i have tried.
my 1 year old received this as a christmas gift today and i was so pleased with it. he already had a melissa & doug stacker that i was about to throw away because the paint was chipping badly and they had a product recall on a similar item. this stacker is finished in such a way that it seems the paint would not easily chip and even if it did since it is vegetable dye, no worries.  i love the muted yet rich and warm colors in this toy and my son likes to play with it as much as the other stacker. it is a little shorter with less pieces than the other one, but for a 1 year old i actually prefer that. i will definitely be purchasing more items from this company!
With my first son I used regular pacifiers. With my second, I found Wubbanub and I have bought at least 5 so far, as once in a while we loose one. I love Wubbanub as my baby can find it in his crib at night much easier, he loves it also as a favorite teddy bear, and because the wubbanub is heavier it is harder to walk around the house with it, decreasing the chances of addiction to having a pacifier all the time in the mouth. My baby uses mostly to go to sleep, in the car or in the stroller. And I think that it will be much easier to break the habit in the future. Maybe I will just cut off the pacifier and he can keep the bear, giving him something to hold to.
My third daughter would NOT take a regular pacifier! I tried them all. Then my friend told me about the Vanilla Scented Gubdrop Pacifiers and I tried them out. My baby loves them. They are sort of hard to find. You can get them on Amazon or straight from the manufacturer in bulk. I just got mine from Amazon (its easier). The review that said they are pricey is crazy. I think these ones are less expensive that the traditional pacifier you can get at Target, and those ones dont smell like vanilla. The only down side is that they do smell like vanilla and your dog may want to eat it. Mine doesn't but he was interested at first. Its just a thought. Great Pacifier!
I ordered the toddler pillow for my 4 year old daughter for Christmas based on the positive reviews on Amazon.com. My daughter was thrilled at the idea of having a pillow, but said that it was too puffy. Soon after we received the pillow, I got a very nice email from Chris at Little Sleepy Head Pillows asking how my daughter liked the pillow.  When I told Chris my daughter's feedback, he graciously offered to send a custom &#34;less fill&#34; pillow.  The new pillow arrived within days.  The &#34;less fill&#34; pillow works great for my daughter. She says it is comfortable and loves it.  I really liked the great customer service from a small family run company.
i purchased this when my baby was a newborn. she wanted to be held all the time and the only way i was able to get anything done was to put her in it. you still need to support their head, but it at least gives you one free hand and a rest for your arms. i now take my baby for walks in the carrier almost every day. she usually falls asleep right in it by the time we get home. i have not figured out a safe or comfortable way to nurse in this carrier yet. i think this is a good carrier for the price and would absolutely recommend it to friends. i find this much easier to use than the moby, and it is more affordable too. i love the color, it is exactly as pictured.
we just had our second child and we wanted a monitor that had good video quality that didn't cost too much. we got this monitor with an additional camera for under $170 with shipping and it's a great deal. it switches between the cameras without any lag or delay and the range is very far. our older boy has a lot of plush toys in his crib and the night vision has no problem in seeing everything clearly although it goes into a black and white mode. the monitor does not warn you before it goes out of battery but this isn't a problem because we have the power cord plugged in unless we are moving it from room to room. overall this is a great monitor at a great price.
My nephew had the frog Wubbanub and he loved it so I decided to register for this one when I was pregnant.  I have to say my son loves it, he's 5 and a half weeks old and has been using it since day 3.  Luckily it didn't cause and nipple confusion for him.  It did start helping him sleep really well through the night.  He loves holding onto the little giraffe and it's really cute watching him.  Washing it is the only issue, what I have done so far is stick the nipple part in the boiling water while I'm sterilizing other baby things but I have read recently on a forum that they can be put in the washer safely and then you air dry it, I will have to try that soon.
these pants are great!  i tried one set out, then went back for 3 more.  i have a total of 4 pants and 9 liners. i end up washing them every day or 2.  most training undies allow wetness to get everywhere, ending in a new outfit. these provide an extra level of protection to avoid outfit changes, wet sofas, wet rugs, or whatever your toddler is sitting on.  child still feels wet in these and since they look like undies, your child feels like a big kid.  i really like these for car rides and shopping trips.  these are not meant to be a diaper, so if your child pees a lot, they will still leak, but no where near as bad as most other training products on the market.
Cute and practical! I'm able to fit two GumDrop pacifiers in this pouch and slip it into my diaper bag or purse, it's very handy.  I love that it's anti-microbial and reusable, my snack-sized Ziploc bag pacifier storage days are over, and I have even more peace of mind about cleanliness. I haven't had a problem with the pocket detaching or falling off of my bag, I use a Skip Hop diaper bag with two interior key hooks, and I attach the pacifier pocket to one of those. So there is never a problem with detachment or locating the pocket, from personal experience.  I can also maneuver the zipper with one hand, which is always nice when you have an infant in your arms.
i'm a mother of 4. i have been through my share of bibs. it is only on my 4th that i have discovered these. i hate velcro bibs. they snag baby's neck, snag my laundry, and wake my baby up when he's sleeping and i'm trying to get it off. most bibs out there have some cutsie design on them that causes the bib to not absorb the milk or spit and it just dribbles off. these bibs are perfect. they are large, but still fit on my newborn from day one. love the 3 adjustable snaps, love that they are on the side and not behind his head, and the material so so soft and absorbent. not to mention, cute designs that do not say \\i love mommy\\ on them. wouldn't change a thing.
I LOVE WubbaNubs. &#34;Giraffee&#34; is one of my daughters favorite ones. WubbaNub's are perfect for babies. Once they can grab, the animal makes it so easy for the baby to find and stick back in their own mouth due to its size. This is nice because when they wake up in the middle of the night they can grab it and reassert it. Helps the baby to soothe themselves and fall right back to sleep. Plus they are absolutely adorable! Now that my daughter is older she loves to babble at her giraffe. They also can chew on different parts of the animal/noonie.<br /><br />I wash my daughters every other day in the washing machine and leave it to air dry! Super easy to clean!
Transitioned to this from sippy cup when son was 10.5 months old. He was able to drink from it immediately and learn that he didn't have to turn it upside down to drink. The only time it leaks is when it's assembled incorrectly. Handles are great, glass insert is awesome, he loves it and I'm happy that we're out of sippy cups and moving forward. He drinks water and OJ (with pulp, no problem) in it now. I'm going to buy another one to start putting his whole milk in at 1 year. It gets a little foggy between the glass and plastic but as long as I'm wash it regularly, I see it as just a cosmetic issue that is unavoidable but doesn't deter me from buying a second cup.
i had not actually seen the frog pod w/toys and was a little skeptical by the pictures, description and the price seemed a little high for bathtime toys since i was ordering several gifts for our 2nd grandson,& thought i could spend the $$ more practically. however, my daughter-in-law had actually seen & registered it at a local baby boutique so when i found the frog pod on amazon for more than 25% off our local price i ordered it. when it arrived, i was very pleased...the quality, the size, the look far exceeded my expectations...the pictures & description did not do it justice...its adorable, durable, practical & fun. my 2yr old grandson & my dtr-in-law love it!
My daughters got these as a gift from my sister in law.  When they were born they were all over 5lbs so the girls spent only a few hours in the NICU.  Once they brought them to our room I asked for a pacifier.  The nurses refused so I sent my husband home for these.    Love Love Love them!!!! The girls were able to keep them in their mouth without us having to help.  With triplets this has been a lifesaver. Our morning nurse used to work the NICU and was so impressed that she took one up to show them.     Not only does it sooth them but our friends and family now look at who has the horse, kitty or dog to figure out which triplet they are holding.    Love Them!!!!
The monkey wubbanub is perfect!! Can't wait till my 11/2 month son starts grasping things this for sure will be a hit. Im tired of losing his pacifiers, this was worth the buy!<br />UPDATE: We eventually lost this pacifier in the parking lot of clackamas  OR Costco and I tell you, whoever finds this lil guy will be a happy camper. I am really sad he's gone! My 4 month old has a duck, penguin, and elephant in his wubbanub entourage but the monkey was definitely one of his favorite as the body is longer and has more substance for support when laying him to sleep on his side. These make for great baby shower gifts and hold up really well in the washer, to my surprise.
Some newborns are picky. Mine was one of those newborns. We tried pacifier after pacifier and this was the only one she would take. So we stuck with it!<br /><br />They seem safe enough to use regularly. She pretty much only uses them when she falls asleep, but we've never felt uncomfortable with her using them. The colors are bright and fun, and the clear plastic is simple and modern.<br /><br />A word of advice-- as your baby gets older, keep an eye on how they play with their pacifier. At about four months my baby could fit a lot of this pacifier into her mouth, which freaked me out. Don't forget to move up to the next size (they make 3-6 and 6+) when it's time!
i have not used this bag just yet, i'm not due until end of april 2015, but based on the quality and space in the bag, it's awesome!  there are so many compartments to use for your personal items and of course for the baby.  it is very light weight and the handles are short so my husband can carry it by the handles or i can carry it on my shoulders.  there is also a longer strap where you can wear it cross-body or on the shoulder and the built in stroller straps are pretty neat.  they are velcro so i think that should make a strong hold when attached to the stroller.<br /><br />it's a stylish, yet functional, bag that i can't wait to use once my little one arrives!
this potty topper seat fits on all kinds of seats (elongated, short, public restroom toilets of all kinds).  it also works very well for little boys, since the soft guard does not hurt if they bump it, and the seat is big enough that they are not constantly rubbing against it (even if they are wigglers).  and, at least for us, we haven't dealt with any residual smell.  my wife wipes it down after each use, and at the end of the day, she does a full clean (takes it apart) and sanitizes it with homemade solution (a mild peroxide/vinegar/water mix or a very diluted alcohol/water mix).  these have worked like a charm, and it's held up well, even with many weeks of use.
We bought this in hopes that it would be easier to find the pacifier. And it is! It can't get as lost with the little lamb attached. Another bonus is if she drops it or throws it the pacifier doesn't go rolling away (we have hardwood floors) and it's easier to grab when you can get a hold of the lamb. Picture sitting all perfect in your rocking chair in the dark and baby throws or drops it and you try to do a ninja move to grab the pacifier, this makes it easier! You can get a hold of the lamb with your toes if it comes to that, and it will.... It's also harder for it to fall out of the crib in the middle of the night :) And of course she loves the cute little lamb!
I bought this because it looked so cute online and when we received it, it looked even cuter in person! I love it so much and can't wait for our daughter to arrive in May so she can give it a try. The quality is impressive and much better than most other pacifiers I have seen. Plus you have to admit that it is so much cuter than anything you can buy at Walmart...which is ALL we have around here. I know no other mothers here will have this pacifier which keeps pacifiers from getting mixed up with other babies. I recommend it and other pacifiers made by Personalized Pacifiers! Also, If you go to their website, you can special order one with your babies name on it. :-)
We bought the wubbunub so it would stay on our sons chest while he was in his car seat. It didn't really work for that until he was around 3 months. Then the wubbunub became his best friend!!! It was a security blanket and binky all in one. The best part is that it has the soothie pacifier on it (which was the brand he loved).<br />Pros:<br />- Easy to find in a bag because its bigger than a regular binky.<br />- Easy for a baby to find when they want their binky.<br />- Easy to wash: I just threw it in the wash when I washed his clothes.<br />- You can easily seam rip the binky off when you're ready to wean the binky and your child can still have their security toy.
Used the bear for the first time last night.  It really works!  Our newborn is already very mellow and even tempered, but he has been gassy because of bottle feeding.  He slept all night without a fuss (BTW, we switched to Dr. Brown's bottles yesterday too, and it works great as well.  No gassiness, fussiness, or anything!) The only thing about the bear, it does not shut off automatically, just like what others have said.  However, I don't see a problem with it.  Mother's heartbeat never quit either in the nine months he was in her.  It will run all night long with the generic batteries it came with.  Just buy a set of rechargeable AA batteries and you are good to go.
The greatest invention of all man-kind, better than sliced bread!  The wubbanub has helped our daughter soothe herself back to sleep and even learn to hold and grab when she was younger.  At night if she wakes up and needs a pacifier she will magically find her wubbanub, turn it around and put it in her mouth.  She started using the wubbanub at 2-3 months and now is 8 months.  I've read many blogs that say you can continue to use after 6 months, but to gauge if nipple is too small for baby.  I also read that the company plans on making another size smoothie for 6+ months! until then we are sticking with these.  Great gifts too!  I have bought 2 and will purchase more!
because your reviews have made our ipotty such a hit we are taking it to the next level.  look for us on the next episode of shark tank.  that's right you can watch mark cubin marvel at this product proclaiming he wants them in the maverick's locker room and the right to license them to sports teams world wide.  but he will have to out bit lori who wants this on qvc pdq!!!  daymond john wants to join lori adding the fubu logo on the side of each one calling it the fubu edition.  mr. wonderful kevin o'leary opts out since he is always constipated.  barbra and rob team up to buy a 50% share in the company that gives barbra the right to install one in all her properties.
i had sophie with my 29 month old when he was a baby and now his 4.5 month old brother is enjoying her. i think they didn't really start to play with her until 4 months old, but she's a big hit for teething.<br /><br />two notes:<br />1. if you have dogs you need to be careful where this gets left. this is a highly appealing toy to dogs due to how awesome it squeaks.<br /><br />2. do not submerge in water or the squeak stops working for a while. i think we got water in it once trying to clean it and it stopped squeaking- but it eventually dried out and squeaks fine again. i think the bigger issue might be mold because there is a little hole in it so it's a possibility.
love love love this scooter.  my toddler would always say &#34;no&#34; when we wanted to go for walks but now he's super excited to ride on the scooter and when he get's tired, he's able to ride in the seat.  the scooter is adjustable in the length that it extends from the actual stroller.  this is great, so you can position your child directly under the handle depending on the height you have it at.  i also love that the scooter is easy to flip up and attach so that it is out of the way.  my only complaint is that it's a challenge to walk directly behind the scooter- you have to walk more to the side, but there really isn't a solution to this, you just have to manage.
this chair is amazing! we started using this for our son when he was about 6 months old. it is useful for many reasons:<br />1. your baby can sit at your level with you when you eat.<br />2. the chair cradles the baby (most high chairs for kids, especially when they are young, are way too big). we were not worried that he would fall back in the chair and we didn't have to support him with blankets like we usually do.<br />3. maybe most important - you don't have to worry about your baby hitting their face on the table (or using the table as a chew toy).<br />4. very portable to leave in the car and use when you go out to eat.<br />5. very good quality. extremely sturdy.
we initially weren't going to buy a swing ourselves since my sister in law gave us a swing(just the plain kind they sit up in), a bouncer and a glider.. well our baby didn't like any of them at first. we had bought the same snug a bunny rock-n-play sleeper for him and he loved it so i decided to buy this and give it a try... he loved it! this swing has been a godsent, he always takes the best naps in it and i love that you can set it to lay down or sit up. was easy enough to set up and looks super comfy, i wish they would make them in adult size. anyway if your on the fence i would definitly buy this, it's awesome and all the other moms i know who have this love it too.
My 9 month old doesn't take pacifiers most of the time, instead she uses them as teethers.  She LOVES this one - gnaws on it whenever she gets the chance.  I had high hopes she would take this as a pacifier, but she just hasn't.  I'm ok with it though and won't dock a star in my rating.  It's incredibly well made, natural rubber, and she loves it.  I wish I had ordered the 2-pack instead of the single!  I am on here to order the next couple sizes (age ranges) up for her and thought i'd better let everyone know what a great paci this is, even if your kiddo doesn't want to use it as a paci!  I think I am going to look into their rubber teethers and order one of those too.
oh my goodness!!! this stroller is amazing!!!! we have been able to use this stroller (using the carseat adapters) since we brought our twins home! everywhere we go, if it's not a comment about our twins, it's a comment on how cool our stroller is. this stroller can fit through practically any door, it fits in the trunk of my 08 jetta, it turns on a dime, and it opens and closes soooo easily! i will say, i really had a hard time removing the carseat adapters (when breaking down the stroller) in the beginning but the plastic has since softened with use and is much easier.<br />i would recommend this stroller to anyone with twins or even parents with two young kids! enjoy!
i am yet to meet a tiny love product i don't love. i bought this for my 5-month-old as an alternative to the activity bar that comes with his bouncy seat, figuring he could use a change of scenery since he spends so much time in it! he was immediately intrigued by it. the colors are vibrant and eye-catching. i like the variety of objects, especially the pull string on the flower - something different from all his other hanging toys. it will come in handy on his carseat, bassinet, and eventually his stroller seat, too since its design makes it easy to attach to objects of varying thickness and can be adjusted at different angles. i wish i knew about this for my first kid!
i recently bought this bag through amazon, at a great price!  i had been eying it for months and finally gave in, after my last 2 diaper bags had zipper malfunctions.  i was not disappointed!  the color (grey/white) and design are lovely.  the inside is lined with a lime green.  the pockets on the side of the bag are large enough for bottles/sippy cups and the pockets in front/back (though they don't zipper), have been useful to store my wallet/phone/keys.<br /><br />the bag also comes with a messenger strap and 2 stroller attachments/hooks.  my husband (although he thinks it's still girly) also thought it was really nice.<br /><br />i would recommend this bag to anyone.
we use this for cloth diapering. it is better than the diaper genie at keeping smell in - and we don't even use a scent thing in the top. it's in our bedroom where the changing table is. never smells unless we open it and, hello people, whether we all like it or not, smell comes out when we open a diaper pail. but when it's closed, the smell stays in and doesn't leak at all. the only issue i have is it's a bit small, but we have 2 girls in cloth diapers, and we wash every 2 days, and it fits 2 days of 2 kids diapers easily. so i guess it's not that small. we line it with a pul lined bag or a trash bag, and the lid still works well. just make sure you snap the lid on right.
Ive been searching for these pacifiers in stores, but they do not sell them anywhere. Thank god theres amazon.com! Anyway- my son was given the gumdrop pacifier when he was first born in the hospital and he loved it.  We lost the pacifier and bought some soothies-- the nipple shape is the same as a soothie, but the soothie is too round and bulky and his mouth doesnt fit on the pacifier like the gumdrop.  It takes my son a while to suck on the soothies, but with the gumdrop once its in, he loves it. The shape contours the mouth and makes it easier to suck...  I wish they sold these in stores so we didnt have to pay for shipping! :-) I highly recommend this over the soothie!
These pacifiers are great, especially for little babies.  Our son didn't quite have the ability to keep a pacifier in his mouth for any real length of time until he was several months old.  If you put this pacifier in his mouth with the animal on his stomach, the pacifier won't fall out if baby loses suction for a second.  It keeps me from putting the pacifier back in his mouth every few seconds and has taught him how to keep the pacifier in his mouth.  We tried pacifiers without a stuffed animal attached, but they fell out of his mouth almost immediately when he was just a few months old.  We also tried Pacimals when he was small, but the angle is all wrong for a newborn.
love this pump. i used it with my first four years ago, and recently had another baby. insurance now covers breast pumps, so i thought i'd give another a shot since replacing the filters can be a pain. i got the medela in style, hoping to be wowed. after weeks of using that and having lack luster results in the amount i was able to get, i'm going right back to this one. i just ordered replacement tubes since mine have been sitting collecting dust for a few years now. fully recommend this. the filters are the only downside in my experience, but keeping a decent back up supply has far outweighed that in my experience. customer service was always easy to work with too for me.
My son is 18 months old and cannot live without his wubbies. We have 4 of them, and the frog is the lightest in weight. He has been using a green soothie pacifier since being an infant, and we introduced the wubby around 7 months when he was old enough to reach for his paci in the crib at night. This little product helped him go back to sleep because he could soothe himself immediately once he retrieved his wubby. We only let him have it in the crib because it is quite an addiction. We let him have two - one to suck and one to cuddle. He switches them out intermittently. Not sure how to begin weening him from using it, but for now we are deeply satisfied with this product.
i used this set when my husband was ill and bedridden.  while i worked at my desk in another room, he could just speak to me in a natural tone of voice, and i could go to him right away and see to his needs.  sound pickup is great.  i could even know if he was over-feeding treats to our pudgy little dog!  i'd hear him say, &#34;that's all.  all gone.&#34; then i'd go to them, see the confectioners sugar on both their mouths, and do the appropriate fussing while they both looked so guilty. he was feeding her &#34;people&#34; donuts!  i carried the monitor in my pocket when doing household chores, so i could know if he had a need.  this item is very handy, and i recommend it.
We love &#34;wubbies&#34; and get a new one for each baby and every baby shower as a gift to friends. The Wubbanub is the ONLY paci you should get. They're easy to find in the dark when you're fumbling around the crib, same goes for the carseat when you're doing the reach around while driving trying to calm a screaming kid. Best yet is that kiddos can start to get it into their OWN mouth unassisted much easier. Most hospitals use Soothi paci's anyway so this is an easy transition and the nipple shape and design is similar to the Dr. Brown's shape for those using them and worried about too much nipple confusion.<br /><br />My favorite design thus far is the dragon, adorable!
There is no music as stated in the title.  On the plus side, that means no batteries to replace.  I absolutely love this toy!  It is flexible and adjustable and hooks to just about anything.  I have used it on the swing, bouncy seat, bassinet and car seat and will use it on the stroller and high chair soon.  It is easy to attach-- hook on the claws and turn the knobs to tighten.  It has a lot of joints in it so you can tilt it forward or back, make it flatter or taller.  That way, it is always in the perfect position for baby to reach.  The toys that hang down are removable.  The sun is really cute and my baby loves to stare at it.  All in all, a great toy for a good price!
Before my son was born, I was planning on not using pacifiers at all if possible.  And if I HAD to, only after he had a solid latch (after about 2-3 weeks).  Two days after we brought him home, he was on a crying rampage and couldn't be soothed.  He wasn't hungry, or dirty, or tired.  It was my last idea... and it worked.  Not only did it work, but it also helped my son's latch a little.  It still wasn't perfect, but it was better than it had been before the soothie.  I like that the center is clear and you can see how the little one is sucking -- you can see the way the tongue and gums are working.  I would add this to the must have list prior to bringing a little one home.
We now own 3 WubbaNub's because they are my daughters favorite!  She doesn't even need to be sucking on the pacifier part all the time - she is content to simply be snuggling the little animal part.  She is teething now and she frequently takes out the pacifier and sticks one of the animal legs in her mouth instead.  The dogs are a little confused because they think all small stuffed animals are their toys, but I just throw them in the washing machine whenever the dogs get to them and they wash right up.  I have washed mine a few dozen times now and they are all still holding up perfectly!  I will probably include one of these for every friend's baby shower in the near future.
This is the second one I have bought because my lo lost her first &#34;Raffie&#34; at the mall r.i.p Raffie! She is very atttached to him and so we got a new one! I absolutely love these things, they helped improve her motor skills and helped her self soothe which in turn she slept through the night which was big because she was a preemie! I suggest them to every parent out there as they will be something for your child to have and save you from putting one back in every few minutes!<br /><br />I read a few reviews about how they are poorly made and I think these people are just nuts it's perfect for a small baby soft and they can tug,chew or throw them as they are just plush!
very comfortable for baby and me! easy to get baby in and out of. love that it works both ways for baby to face me or face out. this is a life saver at the grocery store. my son gets upset in the store with all the attention and noise and by the 3 isle he's crying if he's in his car seat in the cart. with this carrier he is close to me looking at me the whole time and it stops people from getting in his face. with this carrier we make it through the whole store with no tears! we've been using it now for about two months (he's almost 7 months old) and he and i love it! it also comes in handy for walks that don't have a sidewalk or path for the stroller.  i definitely recommend!
our daughter had very bad digestive issues and couldn't sleep laying down. this was a godsend for her and us! we used it until she was about 5 months old exclusively for her to sleep. now we have passed along to family and they are experiencing the same relief with their 4 week old who finally sleeps two hours at a time!<br />one word of recommendation... if your baby is very small you may need to put something under the front of the seat so the motion works. if the baby is very small or not positioned high enough the motion would not work because it didn't have enough weight to pick it up.<br />a must try for anyone struggling with their baby sleeping-especially for the price!
we used these pacifiers with our daughter when she was a newborn.  She quickly learned to suck the Soothie without nipple confusion (even though she is tongue tied).  When she was about 1 month old, we transitioned her to the NUK brand of pacifier because they are easier for babies to keep in their mouths while sleeping.  Now that she's 4 months old and started teething (poor thing!), we use the Soothie as teethers. She can easily hold the pacifier and chew on the nipple or the edges of the pacifier.  She especially likes to chew on this pacifier when we have our finger inside the nipple.  Turns out that the Soothies are better teethers than the majority of her teething toys...
with my first son, i was afraid this stroller would be too heavy and bulky, so i went with a different 3-wheel option, and regretted it. with my second, we purchased this stroller and could not be happier for several reasons:<br />- it's very easy to assemble<br />- it maneuvers easily<br />- the ride is extremely smooth<br /><br />as to the complaints in other reviews about it being difficult to use the basket under the seat when the seat is reclined, this is somewhat true, but a small con given the many pros. i can, however, still easily fit a couple of (plastic) bags of groceries into the basket (from the rear or side) without disturbing my son even in the reclined position.
I'm glad I bought this.  I wasn't going to because of the reviews stating that it smelled rotten or it doesn't smell good.<br /><br />So the first thing I did after receiving this item is to open it and smell it.  It smelled like apple juice.  Open up a canister of apple juice and that's what it smells like... Sweet yet tarty at the same time.  Now I understand why some people might think it smells horrible but I don't have a problem with it. I love apple juice.<br /><br />It wipes the pacifier as its supposed to.  I usually also use it to wipe my Medela breast pump parts after using them.  It's way thinner than the expensive Medela wipes but it wipes the part down good enough.
My firstborn rejected pacifiers (we started him on Nuks) and I really wanted our new baby to have a way to self-soothe in the event that I can't nurse him at a moment's notice.  I saw some great reviews for GumDrop pacifiers and decided to try the scented version.  Our week-old infant has taken to the GumDrops since day one, without nipple confusion or any other adverse effects.  They seem to comfort him immediately when I can't nurse him right away, and are the right size for his little newborn mouth.  Definitely gives me a few moments of peace knowing that he's comforted in someone else's arms while I prepare to feed him, and I appreciate the fact that they are hospital grade.
our baby was born with some breathing issues.  they are mild, but sent my first time mom mind into a tailspin!  this monitor works wonderful!  it is so nice to be able to roll over at night and flip on the monitor and see her as opposed to having to go into the other room and wake her up to check on her.  and knowing that the alarm would sound if no movement was detected.  the only issues we have had have been our own fault (ex.  forgetting to pause the monitor when lifting the baby out of the crib) but once the learning curve was over, it was fantastic!  i'm so glad we have this for our first baby and thrilled to be able to use it with our next child whenever that day may come!
I've ordered MAM pacifiers several times and have always been happy with the product. I ordered more because our pediatrician recommended keeping several in the crib so that he could find one himself in the middle of the night, instead of waking us at 4:00 am to find it. I ordered the Glow in the Dark nighttime and Air Silicone versions. I especially like these because he can wrap his little fingers around the edges without too much accuracy and can also attach easily to a pacifier clip should we (on occasion) need to take them on the go. I would also like to note that the design received was the same as that shown in the picture (a blue zig-zag design and lighter stars graphic).
prior to this mobile, i had one of those wind-up kind. yuck! why do they even make those? i absolutely love this mobile because it goes for approx 15 minutes after turning on. that is enough time for my baby to relax and fall asleep. i love that the mobile is detachable, although my 7 mo old still enjoys watching the little animals go around in the circle! love the projection picture and that it shines on the mobile or on the wall / ceiling when mobile is removed. very nice that it comes with the remote, although i have yet to use it. great music and nature sounds and heartbeat sound. i would rate this as the best mobile ever! wish i would have seen it when my son was first born!
this stroller system is so versatile.<br /><br />it can be used as a stroller, pram, car seat and baby carrier.<br /><br />that it can continue being used as baby grows into small child is also terrific.<br /><br />for this price, you are getting this system with so many uses that it makes itself a bargain. the high quality construction is also a plus for the price.<br /><br />this would make a great gift to a new mother.<br /><br />it's relatively light weight, so practical and convenient.<br /><br />it is easy to assemble, easy to stroll with a smooth ride. changing from one option to another is pretty simple and quick enough.<br /><br />definitely recommended! 5 stars minimum.
we were given the mozart music cube as a gift at my baby shower.  it truly may be one of the best gifts we have been given.  he goes over to it every day and presses the buttons, clapping, dancing and giggling along with the music.  he's learned how to change the songs, how to hear specific instruments and moves to the beat.  plus my husband and i never feel the need to turn if off because it is annoying like some other toys.  after a year it's still one of the favorites.  a friend of our came over with his 5 year old who was excited to play with it, he had one too and said it was one of his favorites.  i will buy this as gifts for my friends who have children.  highly recommended.
The Nuby Garden Fresh Nibbler is my 6 month old daughter's new favorite &#34;toy&#34;. I am going to buy a couple more because then I can have a few different fruits & veggies for her to eat on hand daily. We have tried strawberries (her favorite), steamed carrots, peas, bananas. She will almost demand it when she sees it. I love everything about it & would recommend them to anyone with a small child who's just starting to try foods. Also to give as part of a baby shower gift. People usually only think tiny baby. They don't think of things like this usually. I personally would have loved to have gotten one for my baby shower & I will definitely be giving these as gifts from now on!
We love Wubbanubs in this house. The animals help weigh the pacifier down so it is much less likely to escape the child's reach, are a perfect fit for little hands to grip, and provide a source of amusement for young infants. Essential for car-rides and nap time. Plus, the animal makes it much easier for parents to spot as sometimes it seems like you never can find a pacifier when you need one.<br /><br />The only downside, is you cannot sterilize these like you would a loose pacifier. However, they do hold up rather well in the washing machine. And if your child becomes particularly attached to the animal, it is possible to remove the pacifier and stitch the open seam closed again.
i loved this formula dispenser! you can't really tell from the picture that the side with the lid is funnel shaped, which makes it easier for the formula to flow out into the bottle. i nursed my daughter at first, so i only needed it for 6 months, but it held up well.<br /><br />why it's way better than sassy on the go formula dispenser: at first i bought the sassy on the go formula dispenser and hated it. there is no funnel under the lid, it's just flat, so some of the formula would go into the bottle, and the rest of it was stick inside the container. why bother premeasuring the exact amount you need if you can only get part of out of the container? go with the munchkin dispenser.
initially, i purchased one set to try and since they worked well i bought 8 more sets.  i was very impressed with these cabinet locks.  we do not have exterior handles on our cabinetry and wanted a concealed lock. i followed the instructions, used the templates and had no issues installing the locks.  my baby is just beginning to crawl and has not attempted any cabinet opening yet, but i have tested the doors and think they will hold up well.  i also like the ability to swivel the lock. even though i don't plan on disarming the locks it helped in the installation. i was able to swivel the hook when attaching it to the drawer/door and it made it much easier to get into tight corners.
My 10 week old is not one for pacifiers which is killing me. She also isn't a thumb sucker. So there are times where she is just completely inconsolable unless we give her a little peppermint water in a bottle, she takes a sip and its over. I found these at my local Kroger last night, and they were completely different from all the other pacifiers I had tried.   I brought them home, popped one in her mouth, she didn't spit it out and was in dreamland in under 3 minutes. The gummi ones didn't work, the orthodontic ones did not work, pretty much everything. I have gone thru over 20 pacifiers trying to find ones she likes. And we have found them. Thank you Playtex. You saved my sanity.

i decided to go with washable pads since i didn't like the disposable one. i first tried the one by \\philips avent \\ but my shirts were always wet and i had to change pads many times a day. then after a few research on the web i found that the fuzzi  had great reviews and customers were satisfied with it. so i bought them and as the other customers, i'm very pleased with it. they are large ( might be too large for a small breast) and absorb everything. i don't need to change them many times a day. now only once a day and even for 2days is more then enough. they are washable and i even put them in the drier. these are the best nursing pad i have tried and i'm very satisfied with it!
great price for two bags, one is very small, used to hold two or three pacis, i use mine to hold eye drops, chapstick, tissues, wet naps, and glucose tabs. the large one isn't something i'd use to hold a whole days worth of dirty diapers but when i'm out of town for then evening it can hold 4 maybe 5 if i roll them up (prefolds and insert together) well. and it keeps the smell in very well too! wish it did zipper instead of tie though.<br /><br />edit after a year of use I still use this product, I lost the smaller bag a while ago, but still use the large one, it did tear at the seam where the ties are, and i have yet to fix it, but use it none the less! keeps the stink in very well!
my son was ready to move out of his britax diplomat which we hated.  we had almost lost confidence in britax because his previous seat was so bad. but after reading all of the reviews we decided that we would give the frontier 85 a chance.  we are so glad we did! so much easier to install than the diplomat.  regardless of how we positioned it we could never get the diplomat to feel truly secure. the frontier is snug as can be!  so glad we spent the money on it! the only complaint i have is my 2.5 year old is very active and in the process of climbing in his seat the cover always seems to come off in some way or another. but this is minor as it doesn't affect the safety of the carseat.
love this mointor! it gave me total peace of mind becaue my little one slept best on her belly. if i didn't have this i think i would have been a lot more sleep deprived because i would have been afraid to put her on her stomach. this is the second one i purchased because the first one stopped working when my sister tried to use it but i will happily purchase a new one for each baby. i bought this one for her becuase i think it is such a great monitor for the moms that worry. plus, her daughter was 5 weeks early and had some lung issues so this has given her some peace of mind as well. she is also a belly sleeper and my sister just attaches it to the side of her diaper or to the back.
bought this set for my 10 month old as he seems to like eating foods from a pouch more. the zip top is sturdy, the pouch is convenient and very easy to clean (i just handwash with a bottle brush). it has a fill line so you don't overfill it and a spot for you to note what the contents are (though i just use blue tape). overall, i think its a great set with a great price compared to others in the same category. the opening is on the side which seems awkward but really isn't when feeding and it's definitely easier to spoon food in through the top. i've used this for almost a month and they haven't leaked or anything. would recommend for applesauce, smoothies, and other homemade goodies.
This pacifier isn't an orthodontic pacifier, but that is the biggest POSITIVE in my opinion. A newborn doesn't *need* an orthodontic pacifier, a newborn needs what is going to be the most comforting, and the Soothie is the most nipple-like pacifier there is.  If you are a breastfeeding mother, and you decide to use a pacifier, please be sure to use the Soothie. The Soothie will definitely help you avoid any nipple confusion that might occur from using an orthodontic or other odd shaped pacifier.  I love the Soothie, and my son used one until we gave up pacifiers all together. I plan to use a Soothie with my daughter (expected in a couple months), and I know I will not be disappointed.
we purchased this thinking it would be great for our daughter as a first pillow. the pillow is very clearly high quality and very soft, but my daughter moves around a lot in her sleep so we found she kept rolling off the edge of the pillow because it is so poofy, and she didn't stay still in her sleep long enough to get it broken in to make it less poofy. i decided to steal it to use as a travel pillow for long car rides and on the airplane and i love it! even if you find you can't use it for your child at night, it still makes a great travel pillow and is worth the money! we haven't had to wash it yet, but it looks like it will be very easy to wash and keep clean when the time comes.
My first baby was a NICU child (290 days) so by the time he came home he was hooked on the GumDrop pacifier offered to him in NICU, which we then had to have imported as they're not available over the counter in Australia. Our son loved this pacifier and it suited all our purposes. It was easy to clean, hard wearing, and was awesome during teething as I'd just put it in the freezer, making it nice and cold in his mouth during the many bouts of teething. Our next child was born 4 months ago and I ordered the Gumdrop pacifier for her. SHe has a range of pacifiers in her crib, but ultimately her all time favourite is the GumDrop pacifier. Love this product and highly recommend it to all!
My granddaughter was in the NICU unit for 11 days.The pacifier that is connected to the caterpillar is the kind they used.When she came home, she would not use any pacifier my son and his wife offered her. Then in church, they saw a baby with a wubbanub and how happy the baby was. We searched and found the cutsie caterpillar at a store, but it was the only one. Anyway, when they put this pacifier in her mouth, she was so content and she actually held it to her mouth by the caterpillar.It was such a blessing. with the cutsie caterpillar attached, it stays in the mouth easier and when you need to set it aside, it keeps it from landing on the pacifier.It is a wonderful product.Thank you!!
I love these little MAM pacifiers.  They are curved, so they fit babies face instead of poking away from the face.  This makes it less likely that the baby will yank the pacifier out of her mouth.  Also, because there is no &#34;ring&#34; attached to the front, that also makes it less likely that the baby will yank it out of her mouth.  Since these are for 0-6 month old babies, they are smaller on the outside, and the nipple they suck on is also smaller so it does not gag them like the bigger ones.  I have had a hard time getting my 4-month-old to take the pacifier, and this one works the best out of all the various types we have tried.  We have tried about 6 different types/sizes/brands.
i love ecoable diapers,  especially the charcoal bamboo ones,  less staining to worry about. they also have a wonderful double leg gusset that eliminates leaking.  i also love the snap placement, more options for the best fit. also, you have the pocket option for doubling inserts for longer wear,  but the sewn in pad is great and seems perfectly sufficient.<br />i am comparing the ecoable diapers to alva and kawai. with both of those, you'll notice leaking around the edges.  with ecoable you will have a harder time knowing when a change is needed, which is a good thing right?<br />i'd like to see more gender neutral patterns,  and call me crazy but i'd like solids in basic white or black.
This pacifier pod is very stylish and helpful! It goes with us everywhere and is easy to access quickly when my daughter needs her pacifier. I like the snap-on strap to attach it to her diaper bag and it's just large enough to carry two pacifiers if I need to bring a back-up paci. We had a JJ Cole pacifier pod for almost a year before it got lost while running some errands. I replaced it with this one and am so pleased. I like that this Skip Hop one has a zipper closure instead of velcro and it a tad wider inside so it fits pacifiers easier without bending them. I'm not sure what, if ever, I'll use the outer little pocket for, but I would recommend this pacifier pod over the JJ Cole ones.
very solid stroller and easy to maneuver. i can maneuver it with one hand if i need to and it can make tight turns. absorbs bumps very well. love that i can face my infant and toddler to each other and they love that too. i have a ford focus sedan and the stroller fits in the trunk however i do have to take off the snack tray on the front seat which isn't a big problem. it's easy to open and close; nothing complex and it's fast to do it. actually does stand up on it's own when closed. some people will complain that it's too long but i don't find it so. it has to be long enough to fit two children and i'd rather have it long than wide. i always get compliments on the stroller when i'm out!
we were looking for something to cover the catwalk at the top of our staircase/hallway, but we wanted something that wasn't an eye sore!  and, this was it.  it was very easy to use/install.  my husband just measured, cut and hung it up with zip ties.  nobody can even see it!  we also made a cover for the fireplace, which we used with some strong velcro-like stuff we got at the drug store.  and, we did the same with our glass shelved entertainment center to keep our little guy out of the electronics.  he still likes to get up there and bang on the plastic, but it's harmless.  this product is awesome and i've recommended it to a couple other people i know who are in the baby proofing stage.
i've been using an amber necklace for the past 18 months with my son. people often ask me if i think it makes a difference, and it's hard to say for sure since he's too young to tell me, but it definitely hasn't had a negative effect. he's been a fairly easy teether, and i do believe it has helped. plus, i like how it looks. :) it didn't take him long to forget he was wearing it, and other than occasionally putting it in his mouth he doesn't mess with it. it's a good length, short enough not to catch on things, but easily long enough to be comfortable.<br />i bought this one as a baby gift for a friend, and i know she's looking forward to using it as soon as her little guy starts teething.
I bought this for my son before he was even born. Once he was here he loved it. I liked it because in the middle of the night it is much easier to find a pacifier attached to a monkey than one that is all by itself. Now that he is 10 months old he doesn't really suck on the pacifier as much as he likes to cuddle with the monkey. I think this will make it easier to take the pacifier away. One suggestion that I have is buy two..lol.. when my son started teething and drooling the monkey got pretty gross and smelly, and if your kid likes it as much as mine it is kinda hard to put in the laundry for a couple of hours. I have put it in the washer and dryer many times and it is still good as new.
Bought these to tote along our son's NUK pacifiers.  We can fit this on the skinniest part of the Chicco carseat handle so it's always there when baby boy gets fussy and wants his paci.  This container has holes for ventilation.  It easily fits two or three of the NUK pacifiers.  We've been using this container on a daily basis for 4+ months and its held up very well.  Being plastic its also very easy to clean very well, unlike those fabric paci holders that I also considered.  If your baby uses a NUK pacificer, you should definitely check this case out.  ---updated 1/11/12.  Bought a 2nd case to keep in my car, so that we'll always have a clean, safe way to keep our baby's pacifier handy.
i got this when we first started using the potty on a regular basis because my daughter was still a little scared of the &#34;big potty&#34;. it is great because it easily fits in a diaper bag and is easy to take on the go. it saved the day on a trip to the park this spring when the bathroom facilities were not open yet and we had a &#34;i have to go now!&#34; moment - i set this up using one of bags that was included and was able to just remove it once she was done, tie it up and throw it away - accident avoided!<br />as other reviewers have mentioned, you can use plastic grocery sacks lined with an absorbent paper towel or something similar so i wouldn't recommend buying the special bags.
My baby loves these pacis. He had trouble keeping the Soothie pacis in his mouth when he was a newborn so we tried these. They were an instant improvement. He is able to keep them in his mouth much more easily and they have good ventilation holes so he hasn't developed any rash. They also come with a little plastic cover which is great for<br />Keeping the pacis clean!...I should also note that this is my first child that has preferred a paci to the thumb, so at first I was nervous that the paci would mess with breastfeeding. After a lot of research we tried the Avent free flow and we haven't had any issues with breastfeeding so far (baby is currently 4 months old). I highly recommend them!
Obviously, all babies are different with what shape of binkie they like, but these are pretty universal, as they are the same shape as a regular bottle nipple. My daughter is 9 months and still takes these at bedtime and naps. We tried the 3 months+ of these same binkies, and they are so thick and hard, she was not even interested on trying to suck it. They are easy to grab, so babies can put them back in their mouths by themselves once they get the hand-mouth coordination. They can be attached to a binkie holder that has a thin ribbon as the attachment point- just pull it through the hole and loop it over. They are inexpensive, so you can stock up on them and not feel bad if one gets lost.
We actually got two wubbanub's as gifts and ended up purchasing another because they are so great! All wubbanub animals aren't equal. The turtle is great for when your little one is lying/sitting fairly still since it can lay flat on their chest.  We also have an elephant and a giraffe.  We have the elephant in the crib since you can make it 'stand' for when she lies onber side, makeing it the perfect height (upside down worked best when very small). The giraffe as you would imagine has a long skinny neck so it flops around more. Great for when they can wrap their arms or hands around it to hold it in, but bad when they move their head alot as it tends to get flung or stuck under their head.

I looked at several different tubs, including some more expensive ones, before purchasing this one.  Now I am very glad I did not buy one of the more pricey models.  I love this tub.  My daughter was only 5 pounds when she was born, and I was afraid she might be too small for a tub, but this one worked really well.  In fact, mine did not come with the cradle attachment, and it still worked well. <br /> <br />I did not have any trouble with the plug not changing colors.  Mine always changes if the water is too hot.   <br /> <br />I also love that the tub can be used anywhere.  I use it on a small vanity in the baby's bathroom and have plenty of room.  I would definitely recommed this product.
my daughter received this nightlight as a gift. so far so good - it truly is not hot to the touch (which is good since most other nightlights are hot by morning) quite amazing. additionally, the colors are not that bright, it is the first nightlight that doesn't make her room bright. it is very soft light, and the colors change gradually. my daughter kept waking up at 4am. since she got this nightlight she has been sleeping through the night. last night from 7:30pm until 7:30am - i don't know if it has anything to do with the light, but it started that night. supposedly, there are some free stories you can register and watch online - we have yet to do that. but the nightlight is pretty cool.
we received this bunny as a baby shower gift before my son was born.  now my child is 20 months old and this bunny is his best friend.  we are actually on the second bunny because the first one went missing.  i just ordered two more as back ups because he wants to carry the bunny everywhere.  i machine wash \\bunny\\ all the time and it is holding up great!.  as one of the other reviewers mentioned, bunny #2 has a seam at the bottom that came unraveled, but it is an easy fix and doesn't bother my child at all.  the first bunny did not do this. the bunny is super soft but his head doesn't stay like that once it gets \\loved.\\  the blanket however stays just as soft as the day we received it.
the little masks are so cute. i was so impressed with the quality. even the back of the mask is very well made and nicely finished. the elastic part is covered in fabric and feels comfortable to wear. you will not be disappointed with this purchase.<br />i'm not sure if it's obvious in the description but these masks are for children, probably suitable for 18 months- 6 years. it will fit on an adult's head because the elastic is very stretchy but the nose doesn't fall in the right place and it will look funny. this is a small thing but the eye opening placement is a little awkward, they seem a little too far apart. my son can still see through it but the spacing is strange, even for an adult.
so you are wondering if you want to purchase this clock.  after reading the reviews (not worth the price, cheap plastic, difficult to set the time, etc.), i waited another month before i finally realized something.  the people who complained about this clock do not have a child who wakes them up every morning before 5 a.m.  if, like me, your child wakes you up, wondering if it is morning, buy this clock.  no, it is not a cute accessory for your child's pottery barn bedroom.  yes, it is overpriced.  and yes, it can be &#34;difficult&#34; to set (especially if your child keeps unplugging it).  but....if you have not had a good night's sleep in three years, it is worth every penny.  sweet dreams.
i did'nt know what to get my grandson for his first birthday, and i came across this fishing set on amazon, and i was very pleased, when he found this toy to be his favorite among all the toys he recieved at his birthday party! he also takes it in the house and plays with it in his bath tub time. he has also learned the word \\fishie\\ from playing and understanding all the different toys. it is safe for him to play with which is a main concern of mine and i recommend it for any one year old, and he knows the concept of fishing for the toys with the magnetic pole. and it is nice that the magnet actually works with the toys as well. the toys also are squirters and he already learned to do that!
I will forever love this little thing because of how much my baby loved it during her first few months (now she's nearly 9 months and since about 5 months old she's refused to use it as an actual paci and chews on it instead!). If we didn't have it with us during those early days, I would get a little antsy because I knew how much my baby relied on it to soothe herself.    Now, I will say this - it's white, which is probably not the best color choice when it comes to a kid's toy, and if I knew that it'd look pretty dirty even after washing it many times, I may have gotten one that would hide the bit of grubbiness. But it is a very sweet little lamb and I'll be keeping it as a keepsake for her.
I have bought these for all three of my boys. I liked that the nipple is similar to a real one which I felt helped with breast feeding. As the kids get older this was the one pacifier they could find on their own in the crib which meant more sleep for me. Depending on the child, and their teething, the pacifier end would last about 6 months. As for cleaning I would run the nipple under the sink with soap or put it in the washing machine with my other clothes and let air dry for a really good cleaning. When the kids are at the pint of giving up the pacifier (down to naps only) I cut off the nipple end and let them hold on to the toy. In a day or two they are done with pacifiers with little fuss.
i love this carseat. it's easy to install and seems very safe. we used to have the diono radian and fit barely fit in the back of our small suv. this seat fits better because it has a lot of recline room and it's very easy to figure out how to use the it. the first radian we had was heavy and har for me to install. i read the instructions twice and still had trouble remembering things and working with it. then we got the advocate as a second seat because we use different cars a lot. i loved this seat so much i sold the first seat and got another advocate. the radian was not a bad car seat. it just didn't work for my family. the advocate is a lot wider and takes up a lot more room but i love it.
We live in the Seattle area and our baby was given orange Gumdrop pacifiers in the hospital when she was born. She loved them and had no interest in other pacifiers. I went to Target and Babies R Us looking for more, and thought I would just get the pink/purple package of what looked like the same Gumdrop pacifiers. Upon opening the package, I realized they are not the same! The ones from the store are smoother/shinier. The pacifiers from the hospital have a little more of a rubbery texture to them. My baby knew the difference too, and rejected the store versions. I was so thankful to find they sell the hospital versions on Amazon! We stocked up and baby is now very happy. Great quality product!
this is a great little humidifier.  the controls are simple and intuitive.  i love that the water tray is dishwasher safe so i can easily clean and sanitize it.  yes, you have to replace the filters - just like any evaporative humidifier - but they are inexpensive and easy to replace (amazon has them for $9.99). the capacity or the water tank is just right  - small enough to fill easily, but large enough that you don't have to constantly refill it.  we bought this intending to use it in the baby's room, but ended up using it in our room to replace a much more expensive \\ultrasonic\\ humidifier that was impossible to clean and much less effective.  i plan on buying another one for my son's room.
These bottles are amazing. My baby was exclussively breastfed until 3 months, when I had to return to work. I was very worried because I have heard from other moms that their babies did not want to breastfeed after introducing bottlefeeding. We tried Avent and Nuk and he woudn't drink out of these. The MAM bottles have not caused nipple confussion. He is now 6 months old and he still breastfeeds when I am at home and bottlefeeds while I'm at work. The only issue we have had is that if you are not careful when assembling them, they may leak when warming up the bottle. Just take your time when putting the bottles together; make sure they are assembled tightly and correctly and this will not happen.
this is a great product made by medela. i use the medela pump system so i cannot comment on whether or not this will work with other pumps but i would imagine that it would. before using this, i needed both hands to support the pumping bottles and could not do anything else while pumping. now that i have this, i can be doing other things while pumping. love it!<br /><br />i originally saw this in babies r us (for a much higher price!). there is a great sizing chart on the back of the box which made it really easy to pick the right size. since this is a soft cotton fabric, i bought the size that fits me now (2 weeks post delivery) and figure it would be very simple to have altered as i get smaller.
i have a 15 month old, who loves to be outside.  so i was looking for a hat to protect her precious head, ears, face, and neck.  i saw this hat and felt like after reading the reviews that it would be perfect.  i was also happy with the sale price of $20.  my daughter will not keep anything on her head, so i was happy this came with a strap that would tighten around her neck.  when i first put the hat on, i did not put the strap on tight enough and she pulled it right off her head.  so i had daddy try again and she has not taken it off since.  i can even now just put on the hat without tightening the strap and sometimes she will ask for her hat before going out the door.  great buy for my daughter!
my husband and i had a miscarriage last year, so when we realized we were pregnant this year, we started searching for a baby monitor we could safely use to give us some peace of mind during the early-mid pregnancy. we asked our doctor about this product and he said it was safe, as long as we didn't over use it. so we didn't! we only used it a couple of times a week, for a max of 5 minutes sessions.<br />i was only 10 weeks when my husband and i started using it and though sometimes we could find the heartbeat immediately, other nights we just had to give up looking after 5 minutes.<br />i read that you probably need to start using it later on in pregnancy, but it worked for me on the 10th week. :)
Philips AVENT pacifier is designed with a lighter and smaller shield for newborns (0-2 months) and the collapsible nipples recognize the development of the baby鈥檚 palate, gums and teeth 鈥?if any. The holes in the curved shield create more air flow to reduce skin irritation. And the pacifier comes with a snap on cap for good hygiene.<br /><br />The nipple is made strong so it won lose its shape after being used for a while. It is dishwasher safe and can be sterilized. Because it is the right size for newborns it will remain in the baby鈥檚 mouth, and not slip out or be spit out, making it more sanitary. The AVENT comes in a hand two-pack. Very nice product well designed and made with safe ingredients.
this is a excellent booster seat. as a child passenger safety seat instructor i see all the brands on the market and this evenflo seat really exceeds our needs and requirements. i have a 4 year old son and this booster seat is actually a replacement for a seat that was in a substantial car crash. when looking for a child restraint seat always make sure that you find a restraint seat that meets your child's needs (height and weight) and one that you can use correctly every time. cost is also an important factor when choosing the proper restraint seat, what we did was went to the retail stores found the seat we wanted and then went to amazon were we saved approx. $25.00 plus we received free shipping.
this worked great for us.  my two year old daughter does not like to sit in her car seat on the plane.  she wants to use the seat belt like we do.  she wore the cares well.  it did not hit her head/neck/back in a weird way and made reclining the seat easy.  we have used this on commuter flights and in business class on international flights.  using this, the seat tray can fold down for my daughter to color or eat - not an option when using a car seat.  there is no more work to do to remove your child from the cares system then to remove him/her from a car seat - undo the chest strap and lap belt.  it was much easier to use/carry the cares system and check the car seat, especially now with a newborn.
When I had my baby, we used the pacifier provided by the hospital (Avent Soothie) I noticed that the pacifier would go flying out of his mouth quite frequently. I did a lot of research on pacifiers and found out that the Avent Soothie is terrible for a babies developing mouth and can lead to many dental and orthodontic issues down the road. After my research, I decided to go with these and they are amazing. They are designed to fit your babies mouth properly. I will NEVER get another kind of pacifier. It never flies across the room when he is trying to suckle on it...hwill sleep all night with this in his mouth and have no issues. You should definitely get this over any other pacifier on the market.
My wife & I were given a Clifford version of this as a gift. As we started to lose track of clifford, from the car, crib, grandparents house etc., I knew that I had to grab a new one.<br /><br />The WubbaNub is great. Soft animal for my baby to rub her fingers on, while soothing binky to help her sleep or relax.<br /><br />Some complain that the binky doesnt detach, and it's not safe to wash - however hand washing the binky and animal is acceptable. If  you want a detached binky do not buy this.<br /><br />If you know what you want, and what your kid likes, this is perfect. I will be getting more of these for my baby & any future kids I have/ my family or friends have. No doubts, or problems at all.
i love this diaper pail. it's simple and affordable, and the bag refills are also very affordable. i never intended to buy a diaper pail, even after all the hype over diaper genies and what not, because the cost was always so expensive. and for something you just throw poppy diapers in, i wasn't going to spend a small fortune. with my second child though, the garbage can in my bedroom started to smell so bad, i considered a diaper genie. as i was researching though a lot of great reviews came up for this diaper pail, and the price is unbeatable. i bought it, and i am very glad i did. it holds a good amount of diapers, is easy to change, and completely blocks out any odors. i 100% recommend this pail.
these are great and an essential part of our gameday gear!  our baby loves them, and never tries to grab at them or remove them so that is key!  i tried them myself (took them off the headband and held them over my own ears) and they do work - they do a nice job of muffling everything around you.<br /><br />can't tell you how many times we've been told 'that's so smart' or 'thank you for protecting their ears!' by passersby - it truly makes you feel like a good parent!<br /><br />way better than the other headband-style option that looks like a fabric sweatband wrapped around your kids head/forehead!  our baby hated that feeling and tried to knock them off in seconds!!  this is a much better solution!
Ella Bella is so cute. She is small, about six inches long. The infant (0-6 month) Soothie Pacifier (BPA, PVC & Phalate free) is sewn very well to the stuffed elephant. I love that this toy makes it easier to keep up w/the pacifier and for my infant to hold. However I don't like how hard it makes to clean it. To boil the pacifier I have to hold it over the boiling pot w/tongs. If you want to clean the stuffed animal you have to wash it in the sink by hand. If your child uses his/her soothie pacifier beyond 6 months, the pacifier is sewn on very well and can not be switched out for a larger one. At this time (April 2014) I don't believe a larger than infant sized wubbanub soothie pacifier is available.
i read a lot of reviews, and checked safety ratings before purchasing this seat.  for the price you can't beat what you're getting!  this is simple to put in place (doesn't sit at an awkward angle), light-weight so your child can carry their seat to school for field trips if needed without hassle, and the fabric isn't itchy.  having said that it will still snag like any other fabric and get little &#34;fray balls&#34; if you're kid is rough on it but it seems like pretty good quality.  i have one in every vehicle and my 7yr old son has no issues strapping himself in and making sure the belt is secure under the armrests. would highly recommend over other boosters if backless is what you're looking for.
we got this as a baby gift before the baby was born. we used the sling until he was about 2-3 months old. it was wonderful, the baby never slid around, he was very secure. then we switched him to the infant side. we had to watch his head because sometimes he would slouch from one side to the other, but that was really only because he was still kind of small. once he could sit up, we switched him to the toddler side. he is now turning one and still loves the bath tub. all his toys can float in the tub with him, and even at a year old, he still has room to kick and splash. we are going to be moving him to a bath seat, but only because we have another on the way, and want to use the sling for the newborn!
i first got this product as a gift when my first child was born.  i used it for so many years.  there are seven years between my girls.  once the older daughter grew out of bottles i used it for small items like small dipping cups, medicine cups, and other small items that needed a safe place to take a bath in.  when my second child came along, i again received one as a gift.  it's just a great little baskets to store small things you put in the dishwasher. from bottle pieces to shot glasses, it does the trick.  i have actually given several at a gift myself to new moms,  i love this little product and am pretty sure one will always live in my dishwasher.  they hold up and last, plus are a great price!
i have been very impressed with this stroller so far. it arrived quickly and did not require much assembly. it rolls smoothly, turns easily, and being tall i am a big fan of the adjustable handlebar! my 8-month-old seems very comfortable in this stroller. she loves to sit up and see what is going on most of the time, but it is extremely easy to recline the seat if she is sleepy and needs to nap. i also appreciate the way the sunshade can be pulled down to keep her out of the sun. this was a big factor for me living in arizona. other things i have been pleased with are the large storage basket and truly one-step, one-handed folding. i think this stroller is a great buy and i would recommend it to anyone!
My son LOVESSSSS Wubbanubs. He has four different ones, and the blue pony is his ABSOLUTE FAVORITE. This thing is literally always hanging out of his mouth. He loves to crawl around with not only the paci part in his mouth, but varies between the legs and tail as well. It hilarous looking at him with the pony hanging out of his mouth by a leg. I have to wash it at least every 3-4 days, due to how dirty it gets with him constant use. I just throw it in the washing machine, and its been fine. When I hold this Wubbanub up, his eyes light up and he snatches it out of my hands. This wubby, as we call it, has saved us on many car trips and meltdowns. I picked it up as an impulse buy and I'm so thankful I did!
i already have some of these nuk bottles and i love them! my baby girl is 8 months and it was very easy to introduce these kind of bottles to her (she accepted them happily from the very first time) but in my country i couldn't find the replacement silicone thing (only the normal ones) and not hello kitty one (just pink ones). so my child is already interested on drawings and colors, and her room is all decorated with hello kitty theme (obviously mommy is a big fan :) ), not only nuk make great products , it looks fancy and the product itself is awesome, never spills and you can put some thick liquids in there (like juice and other stuff) and it doesn't get stuck! it is great and totally reocmmended! :)
i switched to this pump from the medela freestyle, because i was so sore and barely pumping any milk. i'm an exclusive pumper floor my daughter since she couldn't breastfeed, so this was of huge concern for me. at the advice of a friend to switch pumps, i did research and found this. it's apparently discontinued so i got it for cheaper. from the first use, pumping ess much more comfortable on my nipples and i pumped out almost 3 times as much milk in half the time it took me with the medela. i know lots of people who love medela, but it just wasn't for me. this pump is much louder, but who cares! i also bought the manual version for when i go back to work, which also works great! thank god for this pump!
This is my go-to baby shower gift. I HIGHLY recommend. When my oldest was born, we went through a new pacifier almost weekly because he lost them all over the house, car, and grocery store. Not with the Wubba! The best part about it is how easily kids are able to find it. It doesn't fall to the bottom of the carseat on road trips and he never wakes up crying in the middle of the night because it's lost. We've had the same two since he was born. I throw them in the wash weekly, dryer and all, and they're like new. After 12 months, it is showing slight wear where the nook is sewn to the plush. I wish Wubbanub would come out with a new line of plushes attached to the blue pacifiers for slightly older babies.
i bought it in the silver lavender which is no longer an available color.  it works great as a bag for taking my books, lunch, and other items to classes with me and doubles as an oversized purse.  it has pockets for my cell phone, credit cards, checkbook, and cash.  i can fit quite a bit of stuff in it and my classmates have said to me, \\where did you get it?  i want one!\\  their jaws drop when i tell them it was sold as a diaper bag.... they say they'd never know it.  it looks classy and could double easily as a woman's briefcase which is basically what i use it for... a purse/briefcase.  my cats seem to leave it alone... they have not tried to shred it so that is pleasing too.  i recommend it highly.
he BinkiBear is simple to use. There are three easy steps. You thread the loop through the ring or vent hole of the pacifier. You then open the loop and feed the pacifi<br />er through the loop. Lastly tighten the loop.<br />The things I loved about the Binki Bear are:<br />*easy to use<br />*it was more like a toy then a pacifier (which reduces the addiction to the pacifier)<br />* makes finding the pacifier easy (for both mommy and baby<br />*  weaning is  easier<br />*works with any pacifier (or teething toy)<br />My daughter loves her binki bear.  When I pick it up she grabs it right out of my hands. It's almost impossible to go anywhere with out her bear. I know if my little one loves it so will yours
Love, love, love this product a must have for paci lovers. This is the second one I have purchased, the first one we purchased was the pink elephant. It was helpful because our newborn kept spitting her paci out and then would get mad, we have found that with this product she has an easier time getting it back in her mouth and keeping it there. She also loves to grab a hold of them. It is nice be cause she was already used to this type of paci, since this is the one they give you in the hospital. Also you don't loose them as easily as a regular paci plus they are just so cute!  I definitely would get these as a shower gift, it is one of those things no one would think to get even though it's handy to have.
we love these bottles.  we had to find an alternative to glass bottles with removable rubber sleeves because our daycare was worried about shattering glass if they were dropped.  with these, there is no risk of shattering glass at all.  and we like them better than the removable sleeves because no water gets trapped between the sleeve and bottle, which can be messy and annoying.  plus, our removable sleeves, by evenflo were constantly breaking. the only negative about these bottles is that the ounce markers are extremely hard to read, especially when filled with milk.  the price is excessively high so we are managing with only three bottles for daycare.  wish the price would go down so we could afford more.
My son must have about 20 of these. He's 14 moths old now and he's never liked the &#34;regular&#34; pacifiers, just the Soothies ones. He used to like the Soothies on their own and played with these, overtime though he stopped using them and switched exclusively to Wubbanubs. He talks to them, snuggles them, sneaks up on and scares them, lol. I frequently search for new designs and was so happy to find this one. He's in the wash now and I can't wait to surprise my son with him. He has buckets of toys, but these are by far the only thing he really likes. Yes he uses it as a pacifier but they're also his &#34;friends&#34;. I can see them sticking around long after the pluggie part has been surgically removed.
I thoroughly researched pacis before I chose ones that I was ok with my son using, and among the ones we tried, this was the only one he ever liked.  It's kind of frustrating that Prime shipping isn't available because when I need them in a pinch (this is the only place I have EVER seen them), I just have to wait it out.  However, I chose it because of the nipple shape (which is close to an actual nipple but for some reason hard to find) and the materials (silicone). Also, oddly enough, we get actual compliments on this pacifier all the time (bizarre I know).  People will say, &#34;I really like that pacifier!&#34; or &#34;What a cute pacifier!&#34;.  It never occurred to me to notice a child's pacifer! Haha
OK, I have waited quite some time to write this review BUT these are the only binky's my little girl will take.   It was really bad when I was traveling because I had lots of extras (which I ended up losing). So, I stopped on emergency to a local store and picked up The First Years comparable binkys.... No, no, no. She would not take them. I've even tried several other times since and refuses them. (They look a little and feel different.) Anyhow, thank goodness I was traveling to my friend's house who is a nurse in Labor and Delivery and brought me some to take with me until I could order these! :)   If your baby takes these home from hospital and prefers them... and is picky (haha) these are the exact ones!
we have been using an angelcare movement and audio-only monitor for our son's first 3 months, and while it has been great, i really don't know how we lived without having video!  now that our son is moving more in his sleep, this helps us know if he's fussing because he's worked himself into a corner or if he's just fussing himself back to sleep.  great for peace of mind and so nice to be able to peek at him without going into the room.<br /><br />the night vision is fantastic and i like that there's no distracting light needed for the camera.  i do plan to mount the camera on the wall so we get a better view, but so far we are very pleased with this purchase.  the two-way talk feature is a nice touch as well.
I had stocked up on Soothies in expectation of my newborn. If you've had a baby in a hospital, you're probably familiar with the big green ones. My son didn't reject them outright, but he didn't seem to be a fan.  I tried one of these within days of coming home from the hospital. He instantly took it and it's clearly his favorite. We haven't had any problems with nipple confusion while breastfeeding (supply is another issue but largely resolved).  Aesthetically I prefer being able to see more of his face, and not just his pacifier.  But really the important things are that it hasn't interfered with nursing and he loves it. If you're interested in a pacifier for your newborn, I highly recommend trying this one.
We were given two Wubbanubs when we were in the NICU with my twins and I immediately purchased two more once I realized how great they are.  I've bought them for everyone I know who's had a baby ever since.  They're cute, functional and so much easier to keep track of than just a pacifier all by itself.  I don't know about you, but when my kids drop a pacifier it always bounces under a piece of furniture or someplace else I can't reach.  These just fall to the floor and it's a cinch to grab it with my toes without even bending over.  (Yeah, fine, judge all you want, but I've got twins and you do what you have to.)  I totally recommend these and I will continue to buy them for anyone I know who's having a baby.
this is a well made easy fit and easy clean product. its suitable for both children and dogs which is the reason i bought it. my dogs love it because whilst they are separated they can see through the fabric and also being so small, they cant get stuck in the gaps in between the rails that standard pet gates are normally made of. i also love it because its sturdy and there is no drilling and permanent fixing to your walls or openings. the only down side is that its not a walk through gate, you have to step over it and also that i cannot find anything as wide in the uk without paying a silly amount of money for it. amazon were quick in delivering too. overall i would give this a 9& half out of 10. great product.
Mr. Toutou is my daughter's friend.  She's had him since she was about 3 mo old, up to now (11 mos). When she dropped and lost him one time, we got her another one. Mr. Toutou can calm her at night when she wakes up in the dark, and she goes back to sleep on her own. She likes to suck on the pacifier, the ears, the limbs, everywhere! It's good that the pacifier detaches and I can wash the stuff toy part.  Now that she's teething, she also bites the circle around the pacifier - suprisingly, not the pacifier itself. The only reasone this gets a 4.5 instead of 5 is when we got MT 2.0, we noticed that the ears are much shorter than the original MT.  We loved the floppy ears.  Oh well... It's still great, all around.
My oldest son was not a paci baby, but our newborn daughter is! She loves her soothie and so we wanted to try the WubbaNub since it would help it stay in place. The animal isn't as weighted as a beanie baby, but it is great for keeping it in her mouth in the car or when rocking her to sleep or when wearing her in my baby carrier as I often do since we have an older brother to keep up with :-) My only concern is how to wash it, but I plan to just dip the nipple in boiling water and spot clean the lamb as the instructions say. I do wish you could replace the pacifier after a while since you are only supposed to use them for a few months due to the integrity of the nipple possibly decreasing. But so far we love it!
I ordered this product thinking it was really cute and my baby would be able to use it when he was a little older and capable of grasping objects. After talking to my sister about it she let me know that it was used in the NICU and the nurses would stuff the animals down the onsies to help keep the pacifiers in the babies mouths. I've since been doing this and it works like a charm. My little one will continually spit out his binkie and then is unhappy because it is no longer in his mouth. When I put this monkey in his onsie he can go slack jaw and the binkie stays put in his mouth so that when he wants it again it is still there. I would recommend this item to everyone with a baby who likes to suck on pacifiers.
My daughter was having a hard time keeping her paci in, and every time we put her to bed it would pop out and she would start fussing until we came and put it back in. I wanted something to prop it in there with but didn't want to have a suffication hazard so I found the Wubbanub! & it worked like magic! We set it on her chest or on the bed next to her and it keeps her paci in until she doesn't want it. Also she Loves to hold on to the soft giraffe- it's like a double soothe. It was smaller than I thought which I was happy about. I didn't want anything to overwhelming for her. (It's about the size of a beanie baby) Everytime we go places people are always commenting on how cute it is.. and how cute she is with it!
It is so simple, but helpful in so many ways: 1) helps hold the pacifier in baby's mouth while they are sleeping - this is number one benefit in my opinion  2) it makes it easier for baby to grab and put the pacifier in by herself  3) If I'm holding my baby and she's got this in her mouth I can easily hold on to the lamb's back leg, so if baby stops sucking, lamb does not drop to the floor  4) in the event lamb does drop to floor, pacifier doesn't go bouncing all over the room like regular pacifier does  5) doubles as a lovie/attachment toy  The price seems like a lot for a pacifier, but IT IS WORTH IT -- definitely  My one complaint, as others here have mentioned, I wish the pacifier could be detached from the toy.
i'm trying to teach my 15 month old how to self feed using utensils. which means meal times are incredibly messy. yes these bibs are large, but they cover up everything, even part of the high-chair. this saves her clothes from being completely ruined by apple sauce, spaghetti sauce, mushed carrots, and anything else she can manage to make a huge mess out of. plus they are easy to clean, you can (thoroughly) rinse them off in the sink and hang dry them or wash in cold water on delicate cycle and hang them to dry. if you are buying them to add to outfits for everyday use i wouldn't bother. they are meant for keeping food off of your child while they master the art of self feeding. i love them so much i'm ordering more.
for the past month i've been torturing my five month old with the hospital's nasal aspirator. not only does her crying probably just worsen the situation, but the last time i used it i made her bleed. after that, i decided there had to be a better way. then a friend told me about the nasalfrida. what a great product. first of all, the name itself is awesome. i simply refer to it as the snotsucker. second, it works. for the past two nights my daughter has actually been able to breathe as i nursed her to bed. finally, it's so much fun to use. the first time i did it my daughter cried because i think she was still traumatized by the regular aspriator, but tonight there was no fight and even a giggle at the end! a giggle!!
absolutely love this pouch! i love all things jujube. this pouch is huge and carries so much. i have 6-7 quicks, each with their own purpose. one is a diapering quick w/ diapers, wipes, creams, plastic bags, etc. one holds toys, books, and pacis for my son, one holds extra clothes, etc etc.<br /><br />the earth leather is just absolutely scrumptious - it really does look like leather and is soft and smooth, but it is machine washable!!! that's amazing! i can use this with my son's diaper bag or use it solo for a night out with my husband - so versatile, chic, and lovely.<br /><br />love the cool, chic steel color with the gorgeous lilac lining, along with the super sturdy jjb hardware. can't get enough of these products.
we all love this car seat; our daughter most of all. she goes in with a smile and falls asleep within minutes, meaning she is really comfortable in it. installation of the base is very easy, so there is less risk of installing it wrong. it is lighter than other car seats i researched, hence easier to carry. i do not recommend getting the travel system sold with the cortina stroller. the stroller will not fit in a small car, is cheaply made and very overpriced. chicco does have a smaller stroller alternative that will act as a travel system - the trevi - but the quality of the cortina has made me want to stay away from chicco strollers. this car seat however is top notch and i'm very pleased with it. i highly recommend it.
The pros:<br />Adorable appearance.<br />Good quality construction.<br />The pacifier stays attached, so you don't have to worry about dropping it on the floor and watching it bounce away (like the regular soothie does).<br /><br />The cons:<br />Occasionally my baby will accidently pull it out of her mouth because she gets ahold of the giraffe.  But this con is heavily outweight by the pros.<br />You cannot detach the pacifier from the toy for washing.  Some may not mind, but I do not wan't laundry soap residue on the pacifer.  Not a huge deal though, I'll just hand wash it.<br /><br />Overall, I would purchase more of these, and they would make a great gift if you know someone who is already using this type of pacifier.
i purchased this pump after three frustrating months of attempting to use a manual pump with poor results.  i finally decided to spend the big bucks and buy this pump and it has been well worth the money.  the first itme i used it i was able to pump at least 4 oz. in the first 3 minutes! my milk production is great now.  the system is easy to set up, easy to use use and is pain free!  i sterilize most of the parts in my express microwave steam sterilizer (avent).  my only complaint is that the white caps on the top can be a little difficult to take off, however the pump is very easy to assemble.  this system takes the stress out of pumping.  it is also very quiet compared to other pumps.  i love it and recommend it highly.
We received the yellow duck wubbanub as a shower gift and I never even took it out of the box. After trying different pacifiers that left marks on Josiah's face, I figured I'd try the wubbanub, because it was the same pacifier they used in the hospital.<br />Josiah is 8 weeks old and he LOVES this paci! He uses it at naptime and bedtime, and loves to hold the little plushie duck as he goes to sleep, and the very lightly weighted head and feet of the duck helps hold the paci in place.<br />I posted pics of Josiah with his yellow duck, so you can see how easy it is for even a new baby to hold.<br />After receiving the duck as a gift, I then purchased the red dog and green frog.  I plan on buying these for future shower gifts!
i've had this monitor for 16 months, and the monitor itself just broke...by broke i mean the charger port sheered off inside the device itself so there is no way i can charge it even if i wanted to.  called motorola, who has a line specifically for baby monitor issues (1-888-331-3383), and within 15 mins, they are shipping me out a replacement unit for free!  that's what i call great customer service!  this is our 2nd monitor system (the 1st was not motorola and we had countless issues with it).  these things...they just break.  i have been expecting it.  so when it did finally happen, i was expecting a long, drawn out and expensive process.  what i got was the opposite.  thanks, motorola, for some awesome customer service!
it is the best mobile i could imagine for my baby. there are some reasons to buy exactly this model. taking in consideration the short period of time it will serve as an entertainment for a baby (up to 5 months old more less), you can use it attaching to the crib, playard, car seat, and even stroller. my baby does not sleep in the crib during the day time. she wakes up, stays in crib for a half an hour and goes with me downstairs to the playard where i easily attach the mobile and go to do whatever i need to do while she smiles and talks with her mobile for another half an hour. i take it to walk attaching it to the stroller as well and get amazed how long she can follow the little toys with her eyes. she really loves it....
i purchased this item for my baby's moses basket.  the sheets designed to fit a moses basket were not large enough for the style we own, so based on the dimensions given for the bassinet sheet, i thought i'd take a chance.  the sheet is a bit big, but because it is the tshirt cotton knit material, it shrinks a little in the dryer. it is also elastic all the way around, so it tucks underneath easily to fit the basket pad.  (it would also stretch well to fit a larger mattress.)  i am very pleased with the sheet.  it washes well, and would probably fit a variety of baskets and bassinets.<br />the white is a bright white, the pink is a pale pastel, and the sage is more of a dull celery color (very pretty with our pink bedding!).
This is a great little device for easily and quickly sanitizing pacifiers and bottle nipples.  We selected this item because we want our daughter's pacifiers to be as clean and sanitary as possible.  What we didn't know at the time is that we'd be using this more for bottle nipples than pacifiers.  Any new parent knows about the drudgery of endless bottle washing.  Today's high-tech bottles have multiple parts, many of which are difficult to clean well and can't be put through the dishwasher.  We can wash the hard-plastic bottle bases in the dishwasher, but we were handwashing multiple bottle nipples and other soft-plastic inserts every day.  Now we sanitize them all in this handly little device.  It's saved us so much time!
this is maybe one of our best buys so far for our 6 month old. we bough it 3 months ago and he still loves it as much as he did the day we brought it home! he always loved the music and toys above his head, but once he started realizing his feet were causing the music, his face lit up every time! he didn't use the toy bar on the ground as much as above the head, but when he rolls to his belly the bright colors still keep him entertained! plus he can bunch the mat up and chew on it :). he pulls on the toys on the bar pretty hard and we have not had any tearing of the fabric or the loops.<br />i am a huge advocate of buying toys with multiple uses, and longevity of use to save space and money, and this is definitely a good buy.
This is our second wubbanub (our dogs finally got to the other after 4 months). We love this thing.  Our baby was given a soothie at the hospital but we needed a way to keep it off the floor. This thing is a great solution. It is easy to spot across the room. When she spits the pacifier out it will usually just sit on her chest and she can sometimes get it back in on her own even without hands. Now that she is getting older she really seems to like the animal more and more. She pets it to soothe herself to sleep and now that she is interested in toys, she always has one near (even when we forget all her other toys). I have never tried any other pacifiers, but if your baby is a soothie baby, then the wubba nub is the way to go!
I love this binky!  Since it is attached to a monkey, I never lose it.  The monkey allowed me to &#34;prop&#34; it up so it stayed in my sons mouth and it's heavy enough that he didn't spit it out for fun, but could remove it if he wanted to.  I have washed it a couple of times by throwing it in the washing machine and it was basically dry when I took it out.  My son chewed through the first binky after several months, so I bought a second one.  After he chewed through that one I went to the store and bought the same brand of binkies, but instead of the newborn ones I got the 9+ mo (i think) and removed the old ones and sewed in the new ones.  Now I have backups and since he is done teething, he hasn't chewed through any more.
This is the best pacifier that I have ever seen!! I used to nanny and wish that I had seen this then. After having my own child and getting this as a shower gift, I will use them for every child. When my son was first born, the frog helped the pacifier stay in his mouth. As he has grown, it has been great to help him find the pacifier easily when it comes out of his mouth and he loves holding it in his hands. I see him grab at the feet of the frog when he is really tired and it is soothing for him.  I have a small blankie that it attached to it (we call it wonder frog) and it has been great for him to self soothe and hold on to.  I highly recommend this product, especially for babies that are very aware of and use their hands.
One of the best pacifiers we've tried. Both Soothie and the newer version, the Gumdrop, have been real lifesavers for us. They don't cause nipple confusion in breastfeeding infants, and don't cause nipple pain for mommy!<br /><br />They can be a choking hazard, which is why there are warnings that when the baby can fit the entire pacifier (including the ring outside the nipple) into their mouth, it's time to get rid of the pacifier. The company punched holes in the ring in case a baby does try to swallow the entire pacifier, so the baby will be able to breathe until they get medical help.<br /><br />Wonderful item for upset babies or to help a baby fall asleep, but I don't recommend leaving it alone with an unsupervised infant.
ladies, i love this thing. debated buying it for a month or two (since there was little customer feedback on the product then), and finally broke down and got it. so glad i did.<br /><br />i wish they would have had this pillow available a few years back when i had my first son.<br /><br />makes breastfeeding in public much more comfortable and relaxing for both me and my baby, esp since i have huge ta-tas and it's hard to just pop him on and off...<br /><br />the one small flaw would have to be the clasp on the shoulder strap. i see why they had to design it that way, it's just a little difficult to undo while you're holding an infant. other than that, it's amazing.<br /><br />a must have for moms who are out and about a lot!!!
My baby's nurse recommended this pacifier when he was in the NICU.  He is 14 months and still loves to carry it around.  I was worried because the soothie pacifier can't be detached but these have lasted 14 months and I throw them in the washer/drier and they come out like new.  They claim to be for up to age 3-6 months but they are actually quite durable.  Soothie makes pacifiers for older kids but not in a Wubbanub.      We get these for gifts for anyone we know is having a baby.  Because they are attached and weighted down (like a beanie baby) they are great for young babies who can't hold a pacifier by themselves.  It'll save you from having to constantly have to put the pacifier back in their mouth.    I love this product!!
We are on our third wubbanub, and not because of the wubbanub's durability, it's because my son loves his SO MUCH! We have extra just in case we lose one. Our son is almost a year old, and he sleeps with it every night. This pacifier has gotten us through the good times and bad, and I love it! The design in genius, and it is very easy to clean. I throw it in the washer, and I dry it on low. I have been doing this for a year straight and only now has the info tag started to lose it's product info. The wubbanub is well made, and comes in an array of adorable characters. Obviously, the owl is our favorite! I have purchased this product for everyone I knew who was expecting and the results are all the same - the wubbanub is the best!
we had a cheap graco for our daughter for the first 2 years of her life. it would constantly beep for out of range (even though the unit never moved) and was full of white noise. we moved to a four level home two weeks ago and i was desperate for something that could do the trick, no matter where i was in relation to her room. we decided to splurge on this unit and i could not be any more impressed and pleased. great video quality, no white noise, lots of variations on how we listen/watch, and perfect reception from one end of the house to the other on every level. i would highly recommend this to anybody/everybody. (i loved the $40 off coupon from soltech as well.) this has been the best &#34;new house&#34; purchase made so far!
love! my baby is almost 6 months old now. i started with the breastfeeding gift set after research and reviews. the baby switched from breast to nipple and never had a problem. i have never had a bag leak! the direct pump is wonderful when you are half asleep and stressed with your newborn. the bags store nicely in the fridge and freezer and transport great in freezer packs. the costs of the bags seem to be moderate. the warming system, the kozi is a must! it never failed me at all hours of the night. everyone asks me what bottle system i have and i cannot boast enought about this. the pump adapters fit my medela perfectly with no leakage! best bags! best one handed bottle system! quick and safe warming system! you can't go wrong!
I have two babies that started on Nuk brand pacifiers, which worked ok but those have have an asymmetrical design so you can accidentally put it in upside down, those also have a ring that they grab onto and end up pulling out of their mouths.  We have tried a couple others but they did not seem to enjoy them much.  I prefer these because they are symmetrical so when you're fumbling around in the dark half asleep you can get them the pacifier without having to determine which side is up. They have a nub to hold onto with is great because it provides a decent handle to hold onto but the babies don't grab onto them and pull them out so easily.  The glow in the dark feature is great too, makes them easy to locate in the crib at night.
looks great. it's 15&#34; x 11&#34;. works great. easy to use. it needs distilled/boiled water, but i just do a kettle and fill up a wine bottle and use that a week or two. i wash the items and place it on the rack and when it fills up i turn it on. it has a few options. it has the i need it now 10-15 min., the 45 min. w/dry and the 60 min. like new w/dry. i use it for tons of stuff. from baby toys, to feeding supplies, to straws, jar lids, pump supplies, anything i can put in here that my kid puts in her mouth that is plastic or glass. but in reality it's just a lazy tool. i don't have time to boil stuff on the regular, and i don't use microwaves. it's a rich mans accessory, but it's real nice. if you can justify it, i suggest it.
We were given this pacifier in the hospital, and it is the only one that my little girl has ever had.  She LOVES it, and so do I!  I was so glad when I found them to order since we were only given 1 at the hospital.  I have recommended them to several friends who have used them and love them as well.  It is sturdy, yet soft and comfortable for the baby.  Before my little girl was born, I had bought MAM pacifiers since that is what my first daughter used (until she started sucking her thumb), but when I compared the Gumdrop to the MAM, it was so much softer without that plastic shell around the outside.    I would HIGHLY recommend this pacifier to anyone having a baby.  In fact, I think this will be my new shower gift for all moms!!
My son LOVES his Mango Monkey Wubbanub. The original we have had for 15 months. It is starting to get worn out. The pacifier ripped out when it got stuck in the couch a few months back which was totally my friend's fault, and had nothing to do with the integrity of the construction. I resewed it (no easy feat) and promptly ordered a back up. My son still prefers the original, but was excited to see the new one. It washes easily in the washing machine. The size is perfect and the different textures and colors are fun. When he was really little it was fun to watch him manipulate the monkey to get the pacifier back in his mouth. He was able to do that at about 4 months, so no more looking for dropped binkies in the middle of the night.
finally! of all the random products i have not cared too much about over the years, bibs have been a cause of annoyance for me! the cloth ones stain, and some of the &#34;waterproof&#34; ones start to smell moldy after a little. i tried the baby bjorn ones, but those were so stiff they felt like body armor. these are soft silicone, so they sit comfortably on my toddler and they roll up easily to go in the diaper bag. i simply rinse it after use or use a napkin to wipe it down. the pocket is absolutely essential and catches food and milk with every meal. my only complaint is that it doesn't quite get tight enough around the neck, so sometimes food will still dirty her collar. also, the clasps sometimes come undone while she is eating.
I've tried the natural rubber pacifiers on all of my children as they were babies, since the materials they're made out of are more natural. Each child has preferred this style of pacifier, so we keep going back to them. They're definitely cheaper than the natural rubber ones. If you try the rubber pacifiers on your baby and he/she doesn't take them, I recommend this kind. They're BPA free and orthodontic. The curvature of the brim is perfect for not rubbing up against baby's nose (a problem in most rubber ones I've tried) and the holes in the brim make it so very little moisture gets trapped between their skin and the pacifier. Also, the smoothness of the plastic brim doesn't irritate their mouths from friction while they're sucking.
awesome!  i loved it.  it really helped my baby sleep better and longer.  i started using it when she was about a month and a half old. she kept breaking out of the other swaddle sleep sack i had.  she would cry and struggle for a bit when she was first put in it, but that got better as she got use to it.  it also made middle of the night nursing really easy. i stopped using it right at 3 month.  she started getting really annoyed with it in the early morning.  thrashing around and struggling to get out.  it was always really cute when i would first release her from the swaddle.  she would be super happy and stretch out a whole lot.  i definitely recommend this product.  it worked great for us, even it was just for a month and a half.
we previously had a summer infant video monitor but after just a few months of use it started to malfunction and lose signal just feet from the camera. i decided to splurge on this monitor and i have now had it almost a year. i have not had any issues at all with signal issues, malfunctions or anything. it has been a great monitor. the camera is awesome and i can see my daughter breathing while she sleeps. the pan/ tilt option is great as she moves around her crib often and the night vision is perfect. i can see if she has pulled a blanket over her face or she threw her pacifier out of her crib. overall i would recommend this to all parents looking for a reliable monitor that doesn't malfunction like the rest on the market these days.
These things are great. We have had two previous ones (one for the diaper bag one for home)for a long time now and a round of bad luck hit us when we lost both of them just within a couple of weeks because my son threw them out of the stroller and I didn't notice :(. We ordered another right away because my son, now 11 months, loves holding on to the little animal. After losing our last wubbanubs I realized they were a security blanket for our kiddo. The other huge plus is that unless you have a baby like mine who likes to throw them out of the stroller they are so hard to lose, which is good!! These would also make fantastic gifts. I ordered our first one because I thought it was cute....little did I know how amazing they actually are.
My son has tried so many different types and brands of pacifiers, only to find that MAM are the only ones that he likes. The Avent ones are a close second but they fall out easier than these. My son used the smaller MAM ones before but after 4 months or so he wanted something bigger, and this was it. When choosing a pacifier, try to consider the kind of bottle nipple your baby likes. Mine uses the Playtex bottles, so I suppose he is used to a larger nipple. The gerber pacifiers were very highly recommended to me, so your baby may like those if they use a bottle with smaller nipples, such as Dr. Browns bottles. Anyway, good luck and I hope this pacifier will work for your baby too. It has saved us from hours and hours of complaining. :-)
i got this sunshade for my double jogging stroller because my youngest hates getting the sun in her eyes, but won't keep sunglasses or a hat on. yes, it is basically just a large piece of fabric that you tie onto your existing sunshade, but it really works great. my existing sunshade is flat, so the flexible fabric of the protect a bub kind of comes down a bit to protect in the morning or the afternoon when the sun is not straight up. (i wonder why a jogging stroller doesn't have a better sunshade - it only gets used outside! go figure) i have done both a long run and a sprint workout and there is no sign of this thing even loosening up. better yet, no crying from the wee one about the sun being in her eyes. definitely a good investment.
Perfect texture and softness, yet durable.  The closest thing to a real nipple which is why I think my LO took to it (unlike every other pacifier I tried to give her).  The orthodontic shape is the natural shape made when she's sucking for comfort (versus breastfeeding), another reason I think she took to it.  I have 3 of them (2 for home and 1 for traveling) and will easily spend the $9 on more if they need replacing.  I also really like the groove for under the nose so it gives her room to breathe, as well as the size - it's big enough that she can find it in her crib in the middle of the night to self-soothe herself back to sleep.  And because it's soft everywhere, it doesn't wake her up if she rolls over it or turns her face onto it.
It all started at the hospital where they gave us a soothie pacifier. Yes, I know the American Academy of Pediatrics does not recommend introducing a pacifier until much later, but I requested it. Anyhow, I only had a vague idea about the different shapes pacifiers came in. My first reaction when I saw the soothie was what a weird shape this pacifier has! Especially the part where you're supposed to hold it. Of course the looks didn't matter much to our baby. She liked it. We tried the NUK orthodontic pacifier and very soon it was quite obvious that our daughter would only take the soothie pacifier so I bought some more soothies and our little girl likes them very much. We've used them now for two months and have not run into any issues.
there is no volume button do what it is set on permanently is right on the proper amount. the vibration is soft and gentle and so is the music. i just adore the cute elephant and love the colors of it. the whole mechanism can come out which is super plus esp. when we need to was it. i just recommend to stuff tennis balls or some type of object to keep the plush protruding into the space for the mechanism. the women hums the tunes very gently and soft toned. that's another reason why i'm pleased with this. i wish this $$$ out when i had my 1st daughter she loved when i hummed to her. this will definitely stay on our family. i might just get another one. i will even listen to this myself esp. b/c i'm a loud thinker when it's too quiet...lol
I bought these for my daughter, prior to my granddaughter's arrival.  My daughter said she'd already purchased a NUK pacifier and they were supposed to be good.    After my granddaughter arrived, she refused to take the NUK.  My daughter forgot she had these but Daddy reminded her. She tried them and the baby loves it.  It's the only one she takes.     They also come individually wrapped and are already sterilized.  A plus.    Also, as others have said, it's nice because you can put your finger into the pacifier to help the baby get started or just to feel their little mouth.  You can also see through the pacifier too and watch them.    Definitely recommend them.  My daughter doesn't think Grandma's research of everything is so crazy now.
i love the graco my ride!  super easy to install and very comfortable.  the head support kept my son super snug which was great for my 3 month old to feel secure.  after he got a bit bigger and wanted to look around the support can come out with ease.  the seat has enough padding for him to be very comfortable as well.  installing was super easy with the visual indicator on the side.  the seat is very big so if you have a very small car it may not fit well, however i didn't experience any problems with this in my vehicle.  some reviewers said they found it difficult to adjust the straps while in the rear facing position, i don't seem to have that problem.  once your familiar with how the mechanism works you shouldn't have to see it to do it.
i bought this stroller as a happy medium between an umbrella stroller and a full size stroller and so far i am very happy with the purchase.  i was debating on this stroller and the city mini because they seem pretty comparable.  i decided on this one over the citi mini because it wad 50 cheaper and i liked that this one could work as a travel system if necessary.  we haven't used it for that function but have been using it for our 3 year old and also have a 6 month old who will also use it.  what i like most about this stroller is that it is still light weight like an umbrella stroller but it is so much more maneuverable.  this stroller pushes very easily and is great to take on walks and shopping.  overall i am very happy with the purchase.
this pack n play was everything i thought it would be when i ordered it. it is rather large (as to be expected with any pack n play). but the changing table is a perfect height so you don't have to bend and strain your back! :) it's super cute and stylish (we went with a green and brown theme to try and tie in baby's stuff with our established earth-tone living room decor- fisher price has a zen collection swing that matches pretty good). the pack n play folds up nice and compact so you can just throw it in the trunk if you're traveling. (the bassinett part and changer do not fold up, but it's still pretty convenient.) i chose to purchase from amazon instead of target because of the super saver free shipping. (same price at both locations) :)
These are seriously the best pacifiers I have ever seen !!<br /><br />The pacifier part is the same as soothe pacifier but with a elephant hanging off. The small animal attached to it makes it incredibly easy to find compared to a regular small circular pacifier, which is easily hidden under beds, throughout toys, and behind the couch!<br /><br />For my daughter her Wubbanubs are soothing and relaxing and help her sleep, she couldn't live without them!  She has used them since birth and still does at 2 years old!<br /><br />The dentist recently told us we made a good choice in pacifiers, even though he discourages the use of ANY pacifier!  Her teeth are perfect and I credit that to these pacifiers!<br /><br />5 stars and the best of the best !
Got this for my granddaughter and was worried it might not be as good as the other Wubbanubs because of the extra piece of material attaching the caterpillar to the pacifier.  She still needs help sometimes getting these pacifiers in her mouth, but the flexibility of this Wubbanub with the extra material actually makes it easier for her to get and keep this pacifier in her mouth.  Usually one would think caterpillars would be more of a boy preference, but the colors of the caterpillar and the caterpillar itself deserves the name Cutsie because that's exactly what it is.  Even though Wubbanubs are expensive, they are a wonderful aid allowing babies to find and get their pacifiers into their mouths.  I have been happy with my Wubbanub purchases.
Our daughter is now almost 2 and a half and we still use this every day.  When she was tiny, it saved us SO MUCH worry and headache, as we could see what she was doing-we hung it closer to her crib (lower on the wall) and I could actually see her little chest moving up and down when she was sleeping.  It even enabled me to shower-I could pop into the shower, and if I thought I heard something, I could pop out of the shower and get a quick visual.  As she's gotten older, we've moved it up higher on the wall, and now it's almost at the ceiling, but I can still get a pretty clear view.  I cannot recommend this product enough.  It is totally, totally worth the money.  Hopefully Summer Infant will come out with a long range Teenager Monitor too! ;)
after my first pregnancy plagued me with many sleepless nights, and achy hips and backs, i decided i needed to try a body pillow, despite my hesitancy to fork out 50 bucks for a pillow.  but i am so glad i splurged.  i began using this in my first trimester, and slept like a baby right up through delivery.  i never had a problem with achy hips or back and was always comfortable, despite gaining more weight with this pregnancy too!  the pillow is big though, and might make your sleeping partner uncomfortable if you have a small bed, but for my california king, there was still room for my 1 year old to sleep with us too! :)  if you value comfort and high quality sleep despite all the discomforts of pregnancy, i highly recommend this body pillow.
i bought this humidifier after my son was born to put in his room.  it does its job very well! what i especially like about this unit too is the soothing noise.  some might consider this a loud humidifier which i suppose it is compared to others which are silent.  in our case it works out great because we live in a condo where its hard to avoid outside noises from other neighbors, cars, dogs, etc. my son sleeps great with this on because it emits a nice soothing noise that drowns out other noises! in that regard it is great and i would definitely recommend this humidifier to other people.  do not buy though if you are looking for a quiet humidifier!  it is very easy to clean, refill and we have only replaced the filter 3 times in about a year!
After reading a previous post I bought the holder thinking it would only carry 1 pacifier.  I was very pleased to see it fits 2! (see costumer images) I am using newborn size and I have no clue how much bigger the shields are on size 2 and 3, so I can not say with certainty that they will fit.  However, after shaking it around, the pacifiers had room to change positions, so I hope that means anything a bit bigger will also fit.      It is very cute and seems sturdy. I first hit it against my hand, then tried it against the table and desk top. All 3 times the container has stayed shut. It gives me more confidence that I can hook it on my diaper bag or purse with it surviving the day intact (and more importantly, that I did not loose a pacifier!)
This is by far the most genius pacifier I have ever seen.  We are EBFing and didn't allow a pacifier until a solid 2-3 weeks after nursing was well established.  No confusion.  Also, this pacifier doesn't go flying across the room when our daughter spits it out.  It just falls to right underneath her mouth.  As a newborn, 9 out of 10 times she was able to get it back in her mouth by herself.  Also, because there is a stuffed animal attached to it, we never lose this pacifier!  A great investment, as we've easily lost probably 6 other green little pacifiers because they aren't attached to something bigger.  Lastly, it's very cute watching our daughter hold her little wubby friend, now that she's getting older and gaining better use of her hands.
this swing is one of the sweetest and most brilliant things to give a new mother! it offers plenty to soothe and entertain a baby, and i like the fact that the legs are so stable. with an active six-year-old in the house, we want to be sure that there will be no chance of tipping. i like the vast array of music and sounds of nature. it's an entertainment center to snuggle up in for baby -- the fabrics are nice and it also boasts a canopy. (do they make these in adult sizes? this could cure my insomnia!)<br /><br />as expected, the swing has multiple speeds and can switch easily to different positions with the press of a button and adjustment. good news -- there's an adapter so you don't always have to go in search of batteries. really great gift!
I use only the Gumdrop pacifiers with our current baby, mainly for safety, as all she ever wants to do with them is bite on them while teething. Gumdrop ones are all one piece, so there is nothing to accidentally choke on, since there are no pieces to break apart.<br />With our other babies, we used NUK and MAM, which I also love, but we've discovered this brand with our baby and LOVE it! She can stick her finger inside the nipple part and bite down without actually hurting herself...we do this for her as well, without getting bit, and she can gnaw to her heart's content...the are nice colours, and I like that they have changed the design to be curved under the nose, instead of round like the original ones that used to cover over babies' noses...
at least 12 of so far 17 1-star ratings complained of the frame being &#34;bent&#34;.  at least 12 of the 17 apparently did not read the instructions.  the frame is intentionally &#34;bent&#34; so that when properly installed and adjusted, the upper tensions knobs extend to apply pressure at the sides, which not only closes up the gap but applies pressure to the door frame making it nearly impossible to push the gate over. this is an excellently engineered product and operates exactly as described, but only when installed and adjusted according to the instructions (that's why instructions are included and are intended to be read and followed). i highly recommend this gate which i purchased to replace an older, worn out gate of much lesser quality.
i can't comment on this brand compared to others, since this is the only one i have used, but i was solely breastfeeding and went back to work 10 weeks after giving birth. this product was a lifesaver.  and with the hands-free bra (you have to buy separately, but worth the extra $25) let's you pump both sides at the same time.  makes pumping a lot faster and easier.  highly recommend.<br /><br />update: i have noticed that on one side milk is leaking out the bottom of the shield (the funnel part).  i did a little poking around online and apparently the size of the shield can lead to leakage (which is really frustrating if you're producing just enough milk, it's like leaking liquid gold.)  going to try another size to see if that makes a difference.
My 3rd child is a pacifier baby. Didn't need one with my first two. I have tried dozens of them, from Dr. Browns to Nuk, to First years and so on. This is THE BEST PACIFIER Hands down!! My son loves it and it stays in his mouth! No funny marks from the pacifiers that have the harder outer ring that suctions to your babies face!<br /><br />These Avent pacifiers are BPA Free, which is the only way to go! I'm very particular about what my baby puts in his mouth (product wise) He's got a very hard sucking action to him and I am now using the 3 month and older pacifier but let me tell you, you will NEVER go back to another pacifier after purchasing these! Way to go Avent! Great product! BPA Free! Great design that leaves NO facial marks either! The best!
our baby is 35 weeks corrected (he was born premature at 31 weeks) and he has been using this for over a week since he came home from the nicu and the binki that comes attached is JUST LIKE the soothie binkis they use in the hospital so he took to it right away! we love it. he's able to hold it all by him self and he's only 5lbs still! I would soo recomend this paci for any baby! and the extra paci's are super cheap! we bought it straight from pacimals.com and only spent $28 after shipping and taxes and got toutou the dog plus 3 paci's that attach right on. I wouldn't recomend using the adaptor and other paci brands I would just stick with the kind that were made for it. I included a photo of my little man in the pictures at the top with mr. toutou.
Unlike many other pacifiers, these are made of a single piece of silicone, which eliminates most potential choking hazards. In addition, being made of a single piece of silicone means  they are really easy to clean, which is EXTREMELY important, and they dry thoroughly and quickly. (You can even boil them to sterilize them.)  Other types of pacifiers we've tried  ended up with condensation/water droplets stuck inside them... no good.    Also, if you are concerned about nursing issues, that shouldn't be a problem with these pacifiers. They were recommended to us by a registered nurse who is also a lactation consultant. (Incidentally, she was not a fan of the orthodontic pacifiers.)    FYI, these pacifiers work well with the Booginhead Pacifier Holder.
although we are new to the baby scene, and we just activated our wifi baby monitor, it's clear that this a great product. love the app for the ipad and iphone. the visual and audio quality are fantastic and there are a lot of options to play with. the fact that this can serve as a baby monitor, nanny cam and security cam should help to make this the gift that will keep on giving!<br /><br />had some initial hiccups with the setup so had to call support. was so glad i did and highly recommend going this route if not technically savvy. very pleasant experience and informative. everything was explained succinctly and the rest of the setup was pretty much a breeze with a little help.<br /><br />love this product so far and the team that stands behind it!
i just bought another one of these for a gift, because i think it's so great!  i originally purchased for my baby at 6 months old and i wished i would have had it sooner.  there were times where baby would be crying or coughing and suddenly stop.  was she ok?  i didn't know without pulling over until i got this mirror.  now a quick check in my rear view mirror and i can see how/what she's doing (and sometimes she is doing the cutest things in her car seat :).  also, with the recommendations to leave babies rear-facing until age 2, it's extra nice to have this.  my daughter loves this too -she'll make faces or smile at herself in the mirror.  also, this mirror is not gaudy looking - it looks nice a subtle in any car interior.  i would highly recommend.
we loved this diaper on our slender, 8 1/2 pound heavy wetter. the inside looks kind of wrinkly, which seems like it might be uncomfortable, but she doesn't seem to mind. the fit is excellent at both the waist and the legs, which has been hard for us to find, and it did not leak at all. plus the monkeys are adorable! we've had bad fits with the grovia newborn aio and the fuzzibunz extra small pocket diaper - both of those are loose at the waist on her and have leaked up the back on multiple occasions. the only other diapers that have consistently worked well for us are the rumparooz 'lil joeys and prefolds with a thirsties cover. full disclosure - so far we have only used it once. i will update this rating if we have any trouble with it in the future.
This pacifier pouch does the job very well. It easily snaps onto my diaper bag handle and I never had any problem with it getting detached or anything. I like that it has a simple, velcro flap closure instead of zipper closure on a round case as many other pacifier pouches have, so it's very easy to get the pacifier out. I usually have my baby in one arm when I want to take it out, so velcro makes it easier for a quick, one-handed opening. I usually keep one NUK pacifier with a Booginhead Paci Grip attached to it, and it's a perfect fit. I have taken 2 pacifiers and it was kind of tight, but if you don't have the strap, 2 pacifiers would fit pretty well too. The outside fabric is wipable so it's easy to clean if anything gets spilled on it or something.
i love this diaper bag, it is a generous size and fits all my baby's essentials.  the pattern is beautiful and the colors are just as pictured.  this bag is very sturdy and well made, the only thing i noticed was that there was a bit of foam sticking out of the stitching on the changing pad. no biggie, i trimmed it off and it looks good--it serves it purpose.  the smaller bag that came with it is an excellent size also. i got the idea from another review and had my daughters name embroidered on it.  it looks like nothing else i had seen in local stores and i get compliments on it all the time.  this is a great buy and they have so many different patterns and colors to choose from that i'm going to order another.  i would definitely recommend this product.
if you breastfeed, you know what it does to your skin. it makes your skin hard and flaky and sometimes even painful. i knew there had to be a cream out there that actually worked. then i saw this nursing mama nipple cream by anna naturals and knew that it was something i had to try out. this cream is very creamy and soft when you apply it. the smell was a sweet smell, nothing too strong or irritating for baby. this cream has actually done wonders and made my skin softer and less painful. not once has my daughter and a reaction to it, so i know that it is safe for babies. i am very pleased with this product and think that every nursing mother should own some.<br /><br />i received this product at a free or discounted price for my honest and unbiased review.
The happy cloud mattress pad is a very important thing for all cribs. Protecting the crib mattress is very important. Its where you child will sleep for majority of his childhood until they are out of their cribs. The mattress pad is very nicely made. The seems are tight and there was no loose stings hanging from it. The mattress pad stays on nice and secure. After a couple of nights with my son tossing and turning it hasn't moved at all. It is also machine washable for any incident the little one may have! When its time to put it back on the mattress its extremely easy. I would recommend it to all parents and any parents to be!<br /><br />I received this product in return for my honest unbiased review. The discount has not changed my view on this product.
i bought this a month ago when my son was 4 months old. he instantly loved it. now he is able to roll around the kitchen and house and is figuring out the many musical options. i have seen the ones in the stores and by far this is the best one. he once spit up too much on the toy part and it malfunctioned. i took it off and wiped it then let it dry and now it works great. i rotate him from the bumbo seat to this and sometimes the bouncy ( he is getting bored with that one). he gets bored easily and this is the one place i can put him that keeps him safe and happy for some time. the only thing is it is difficult to remove the seat to clean it if there's a diaper leak. it is easier to wash it without removing it. i love this walker and it looks fabulous too.
This is the ONLY pacifier that my child can use, all the others that I have tried caused a gag reflex response. We tried not using a pacifier but babies need something to soothe them. I had tried the Dr. Brown's pacifier stage 1 (for younger babies)  but my baby would just spit it out or it would come out. It was like it wasn't long enough. I figured I just try the ones for older babies Stage 2. I am glad I was able to find these pacifiers because it is not fat or bulky. It is thinner, almost flat and elongated. It doesn't cause my baby to gag at all! I wish they would provide two covers, one for each pacifier but they only provide one for both. I still gave them five stars because these things work for my child. No more sleepless nights or fussy baby! Yay!
with twins we tried about every bottle we could find, and with both babies being a bit different on how they fed it made things interesting.  we had to drive 100-miles to pick these up, but it was well worth the trip.<br /><br />sometimes you won't get any burp from the babies (you keep waiting, and waiting, but nothing), whereas some other bottles were a burping fest afterwards, or spit-up.<br /><br />the nipples do not collapse, and they have been able to go from breast to &#34;boob&#34; without any issues.<br /><br />easy to clean, actually really easy to clean.  you can buy a matching spin brush that works well and looks sleek.<br /><br />our little guys tend to get some dripping out the sides of their mouth, but this was the same for all bottles tested.
Let me start off by saying that Wubbanubs are the best thing since sliced bread!!  They may be a little bit more expensive than your average binky but your sanity, especially in the early days, is priceless.  With that said we are wubbanub addicts in our house.  My son has more than 10 and I will probably buy more (we like to match his binky with his outfit).  'God Bless Plush Lamb' wubbanub is one of the better ones out of the bunch but mine arrived with some stitching and cosmetic defects (I'm hoping this is an isolated issue as we've had no trouble with our other wubbanubs so I'm not deducting from the rating).  I like the way it lays and also the weight, and who doesn't love the sweet innocence of this wubbanub?!  Absolutely precious!  One of my favorites.
we have 2 kids and live in small 2 bedroom condo and space is very limited.  the primary reason i bought this tub is because it folds up and can hang in the shower when not in use.  it works perfect for us for this reason.  the tub is much larger than i expected it to be, but i can tell it will work for a long while with our growing baby.  we bathed our 1 week old in the tub with a foam sponge insert that i bought at babies r us for $8 and it worked great!  i was able to angle the tub by pushing one side completely down and leaving the other side slightly folded.  i would recommend this tub, but if you are going to buy it, i would buy it from walmart.com.  it is significantly cheaper there, i think $34 and if you have it shipped to the store, shipping is free.
This pacifier is one of the top 3 things that got us through those first few weeks/months of a new baby. We have quite a pacifier baby, but the pacifier kept falling. Even when standing up from a sitting position with the baby, a pacifier frequently drops to the ground. With the stuffed animal attached, it give it enough weight that that no longer happens (or happens less frequently). As baby started using his hands more, he could then hold on to the pacifier a little easier. It also rested very well on his chest in the carseat and is larger to grab and put back in baby's mouth when reaching backwards into the back seat. The price may make this appear to be a more extravagant item, but would make an outstanding shower gift. Plus, the little giraffe is adorable!
my son is three and a half and we've been having a lot of trouble washing his hair for about the last year he can't stand water in his face or his ears. when we put the visor on backwards it keeps all the water with his face and ears and giving him a bath is now manageable. i didn't think the visor was going to fit good at first but it fits snug i have to put my hand on it a little just to reassure him that the water wont  push the visor down but i think it would stay on its own. i would recommend this 100 percent it was worth the $25 i spent for sure. i thought about getting those cheaper flimsy visors but i'm glad i did not waste my money on them. this one is made of good material and will last and was well , well worth the money spent! ten stars in my book!!!
of course, there were good and bad reviews for this gate but i thought i would give it a try and i am not sorry.  it arrived well packed and was easily assembled as the instructions were clearly written.  the gate actually comes in 2 main pieces.  the main section and an extension for wider doorways.  i did not use the extension.<br /><br />the instructions said to mount the gate 3 inches off the floor but i didn't want it that high so i used the flat side of a 2 by 4 to rest it on while installing it, making the height about 1 1/2 inches off the floor.  it worked perfectly.  the gate is all metal except for a few small parts.  when the gate is open, i'm sure it is wide enough for anyone to get thru.  so, i give it 5 stars and would recommend this gate to anyone.
we've been using these thermos foogo phases bottles for a while now with our sons. we have the non-insulated straw bottles and the insulated, stainless steel straw bottles. i like the pretty design on this one for our daughter. it keeps her milk cold for hours on end while we are out and  about, especially if i keep it in an insulated cooler bag with an ice pack. i'm planning to take it with us on our flight to maui next month, so she'll have whole milk during her flight, which the airline may or may not carry. the bottle is sturdy and i like the flip-top cap, which keeps the straw clean when not in use. it's also easy to use, so that my 19-month old can open and close it on her own. it does spill, however, so i do have to keep any eye on her when she's using it.
For our first baby we bought a variety of pacifiers. She didn't end up needing one much, but when she did, this was her favorite. I bought hoping it would keep the pacifier in her mouth. She is an active one and her hands would always knock the pacifier out. It did help some but not as much as I would have liked. However it does do something for her because I have a pacifier exactly like the one on the dog and it doesn't do the trick. She is at the point where she wants to grab ahold of something and this perfect. Needless to say we don't leave home for long without it. Oh beware you get tons of comments. Everyone who see her with it thinks it is adorable and just raves about it. My sister thought it was so cute, she bought her 3 more, different animals of course!
i tell you, this product is better than an internal oven lock! because, i am able to leave it in the lock position while i cook!<br />which allows me to do other things around the house and not have to be subject to hovering over the stove for 40 minutes and saving the huge headache of constantly telling my son to &#34;get away from the stove, it's hot!&#34;<br /><br />oh and to top it off, it's very easy to use.<br /><br />however, there is a negative. i have a dual oven. the top oven is smaller (1 rack) than the bottom oven (3 racks). the lock will only fit the top one, and not the bottom door. fortunately, we are a small family of 4 and only need to use the top oven.<br />so, it works for my family.<br /><br />i would recommend this product. i absolutely love it.
this cloth book was such a huge hit with my little girl that i've been desperate to find something she will love just as much.  i haven't yet!  this book has kept her enthralled since she was just 2 1/2 months old.  she figured out how to pull the flaps down, and she still plays with it nearly ever day at 5 months old.  the owl page is a little trickier than the others, but she loves the challenge!  she's starting to understand words a little more and is getting more and more out of this book.  i'd recommend this to anyone who wants to &#34;read&#34; to their little ones.  the only trouble with it, is she thinks all books have flaps that need to be pulled down now.  so i read regular books to her, and she slaps and claws at the pages searching for the flaps.  ha ha!
as a die hard ownder of a phil & teds sport (its 6yrs old and has carried 4 kids!), we were looking for something to use daily to retire the p&t for jogging only as its gotten a bit worn out. we decided on the britax b ready. ordered the doubles seat from amazon on a sunday and it arrived tuesday morning! when i opened the box, i gasped at how gorgeous the color is on the green...very rich. the seat feels very solid, nicely padded and roomy. we didn't get the main stroller part yet so haven't \\used\\ it yet but really it feels nice. i had our almost 3 yr old sit in it and he was very comfy. i like the 5 point harness and the fact that a kid can't unbuckle it (as toddlers like to do).   overall- so impressed with the shipping speed and the color of this is stunning.
My great husband found these online right before my daughter was born, and they are INDISPENSABLE!! The stuffed animals helped to keep the paci from falling out all the time, and my little girl loves to hold them, even when she was a newborn. Now that she is older, I watch her at night when she wakes up, she feels around, grabs her Wubby and sticks it in her mouth, so that mommy doesn't have to go in 4,000x a night to stick the paci back in! Not only that, but we get compliments everywhere we go from people asking about them...they are so darn cute.     We have the ponies (both), the kitten and the duck. The duck is my least favorite because it's wings make it hard to stand up next to your baby in the crib. This is now my standard baby shower gift for all my friends!
I like these pacifiers.  They are nice clean and basic looking.  They are easy to clean and the plastic doesn't get all nasty looking, it stays nice and clear.  The only problem I see is something that is the same with all the pacifiers I have bought...water gets inside the nipple and eventually makes the inside of it have a cloudy look.  That doesn't effect the outside of it though. The plate of the pacifier has plenty of air holes to help with air circulation around the skin.    The best thing about these is there is no top or bottom to it.  This is good for a baby learning to put his own pacifier in his mouth or a half asleep baby grabbing for it in the middle of the night.    These come in a 2 pack of blue and red or green and orange.  Any are good for boy or girl.
Love these pacifiers! Before he was born I got three types - Nuk, Soothies, and Mam - to try if he was indeed the pacifier type of baby. Nuk was immediately rejected, and he was so content with the Mam that we skipped the Soothies and gave them to the neighbor. He seems to like the less molded shape of the Mam nipple and has been a happy camper since. I'm not so impressed with the glow in the dark because they seem to not glow after an hour or two, even though I set them on the windowsill during the day - however we've found that if he has a couple pacifiers in his crib, he'll put them in himself now if he loses the one he fell asleep with - very nice way to offset the issue of the pacifier falling out and it needing to be replaced (usually by you!) at 4am. Thanks Mam!
I always worry about my son's pacifier being dirty when we are out. At home, we can always wash it before giving his pacifier to him. But it is not always that convenient when we are out. I know a lot of people do not quite care about it or think lightly of if the pacifier being super clean. I am so relieved when I found this product - what a great idea. I also use it to wipe my nipples before I nurse my son. It makes me feel better knowing that I clean the stuff that is going to enter his mouth.  He is now 3 months old. I plan to use this to clean all the toys that he will be chewing on later. Again, toys can be washed when we are at home but not easily when we are out. This product really comes in handy when we are out. I carry it in my purse and in my diaper bag now.
If I had to return all my gifts and keep one, this is the one I would keep.  I got it as a baby-shower gift and have used it until my little one was ready to sleep on her crib at 3 months of age(actually, that's when I was ready to let her go to her crib.. :-).  The co-sleeper was very easy to put together and very simple to attach to our bed.  It was great when my daughter would wake up for her middle-of-the-night feedings.  I would pick her up, feed her and place her back to sleep without ever leaving my bed.  The only thing I was not too thrilled about was the mattress it comes with.  I found it to be a bit hard so I purchased a little pad and cut it to fit.  It worked great!    I highly recommend this item to all mothers, especially if you plan on breasfeeding!  :-)
i purchased this in oct. 2009 when i was beginning to pt my son.  i had used a potty chair with my daughter and hated cleaning it.  this was perfect for my little boy to begin using the potty.  now two years later he still uses it to poop.  he is almost 4 and stands to pee, but puts this on all by himself when he has to poop.  it is still great, despite my initial thoughts that it seemed flimsy and wouldn't last.  it has lasted 2 plus years and still works like day one.  it fits fine on our elongated toilet both with seat up or down.  and the only drawback was that when he was learning to pee sitting down, sometimes it would leak out underneath if he didn't point down enough.  not a huge deal, but that was the one downside.  other than that this has been a great seat!!!
we have the older version of the fisher price portable potty (in that version the top does not come off for use on a regular toilet.) it is the single most valuable kid-gear i have ever owned. it is great that you can use any kind of bag. we typically use kitchen trash bags, but in a real emergency, i've even used a plastic shopping bag. you can use maxi pads to absorb liquid if you want, but if you find a trash bag you find reliable enough, it's hardly necessary. (we buy costco's kitchen trash bags in bulk, and i've never had one leak.) i saw one reviewer complain that it is large. i think this is a huge bonus, as i still use this potty for emergency situations for my 6 1/2 year-old daughter without any problem. she would crush some of the comparable products i've seen.
this is my 2nd child that i have breastfed.  i really didn't pump often with my previous son because he wouldn't take a bottle. i was determined to get this child to be able to take a bottle.  i had some issues with nursing and ended up meeting with a lactation consultant. in my meeting with her, i learned there was different sizes for the pump. i never knew that! i dealt with the pinching feeling because i thought that was how pumping was suppose to feel.  she was the one who told me that there was different sizes and taught me how things should look when pumping. i ordered the 30mm thinking it was big enough and found out that it wasn't. i was so glad to find the 36mm...no more pinching feeling! it feels great! it's pretty close to how things feel when i nurse my son!:d
While I know this does not have all of the bells and whistles that some video monitors have, I am very happy with this product.  It does what I want it to do.  It gives me a clear image of my son sleeping in the dark.  The screen times out after a while but the sound continues to work so if you hear something you can touch a button and see your child again.  I do not use the talk or lullaby feature as this only gets my son excited and prevents him from falling asleep.  I also have not tested out the battery yet as I have always left it plugged in.  I think the night vision is perfect.  I have no problems seeing my son in the dark.  It is very easy to use and set up.  I would recommend this product for someone who simply wants a video monitor to watch and hear their child.
this is the 2nd symphony 65 dlx car seat we've purchased. we loved it so much for our older son that when it came time to get a seat for our younger son we didn't think twice! this model is better then the older seat we have. the fabric isn't as absorbent and wipes off easily. the head piece slides up and down to provide support, and the base tilts into 3 positions. my younger son's head still falls forward in this seat when he falls asleep, but as we discovered with other models this is unavoidable in the non-infant seats, and his head falls forward less in this one. the black infant positioner you see in the photo is only good for infants, my son is 1 and too tall for it. i wish the company would come out with a head positioner for this, but all around it's a great seat.
I have the lamb Wubbanub for my daughter and I bought this caterpillar as a shower gift for a friend. The shipping was very quick, maybe 2 days? The package was new, and it all looked clean and neat. She really liked it!  As for the product itself, I think Wubbies are really great pacifiers for different reasons. The toy serves the purpose as something to give the baby to do. My daughter likes to chew on her some and then she'll put the paci back in her mouth. Using the wubbie, she learned just how to put it back in her mouth, which is very nice. It's also hard to lose a wubbie! I hate searching underneath the crib, or in between a blanket or under a carseat for a single pacifier. They clean easily, just wash in the gentle cycle and air dry. They also get lots of compliments.
i have a 7 year-old daughter and a 4 year-old nephew and 3 year-old niece that i knew would i enjoy this. when i was given the opportunity to receive this awesome bath toy organizer and test it out and give my honest and unbiased opinion. it shipped quickly and arrived as promised.  i knew that weekend there was going to be some happy little people at my house. boy was i right.<br /><br />the bath toy organizer is made well and plenty big enough to hold lots of bath toys. it comes with and hangs by small suction cups. the foam letters and numbers that came with it are just awesome. they are so neat. they will stick to the bathtub walls just by being wet. they dry out fairly quickly and can be played with outside of the bathtub also. its a great toy to have. my littles love it.
my poor little baby girl started teething at 2 months old...bummer! she wasn't really  aware of holding things at this time so i struggled to find something she could chew on easily. i tried a lot of things people suggested but couldn't find anything she liked (besides my knuckle). i happened to have this teether on hand since it got so many good reviews. so i decided to work with her on holding it by wrapping her hand around the neck repeatedly and by 2 1/2 she was (somewhat) able to hold it in her mouth all on her own! now at 3 1/2 months she loves it and will chew on the face and leg very happily! i am so pleased!! she also loves the squeaky sound it makes! and with food grade inks and all natural rubber, what more could you want!?<br /><br />what a wonderful teething toy!!!
my daughter got this off her baby registry and i helped her unpack it and do laundry for the new baby clothes. hamper is very sturdy, the colors are vibrant.  the only problem is the lid was so tight it caused the hamper to buckle in on the sides. if we hadn't already opened it and used it, i would have urged her to return it.<br /><br />update:  thanks to another reviewing informing me that the hamper lid goes on the inside, not the outside (duh!  can't believe i didn't figure that out...), i'm updating my review from 3 to 5 stars.  nice for a child or a baby because it holds lots of soiled clothes until you're ready to do laundry and the green and pink colors are very nice.  i like that you can toss your clothes on the lid and it drops right in without having to remove the cover.
We love these. My daughter is 2 and still uses this every day. She has been using them since she was born and they became a life saver for us. There is nothing worse than trying to find a small pacifier in the crib, in the dark. This wubbanub makes it so much easier to find and it keeps the pacifier in the child's mouth when they sleep. When they are riding in the carseat, you can use the plush body to keep the pacifier in the child's mouth. These DO get filthy though... they fall on the floor and the plush part gets dirty. We usually throw them in the wash with a non scented mild baby detergent, let them air dry, and then clean the rubber part with a mild dish soap. Also, the rubber part is NOT removable. If the child bites through the rubber, the pacifier part can not be replaced.
Honestly I didn't think I needed one more convenience item to take up counter space. But the price is low enough to consider giving it a try. Once I realized how simple it was, how little space it actually took up... well I'm hooked. First off I want to say that most of the time there are over 10 pacifiers floating around the house. Someone is always picking them up and putting them on various counters, tables etc. Since putting this handy device on the counter, now everyone just tosses the found pacifiers right into it! Makes it convenient, because I can always find one when I need and I know it's been sanitized. The bonus was that it came with pacifiers, so we have plenty to go around. Overall I wouldn't normally consider buying this item, but now that I have it, I think it rocks!!
I am so happy Baby Brezza made this sterilizer! After we made the decision to sterilize, I wanted to get something that did not use the microwave.<br /><br />Yes, the microwave sterilizers are 1/3 of the cost of this, but I didnt feel safe using the microwave everyday on the bottles.<br /><br />This system has a drying rack that is portable. We use the bottom right option (under the power button) that is the sterilize/dry feature. It takes 60 minutes to run full cycle. We load up 5 phillips advent bottles and 5 nipples in one run.<br /><br />Just make sure to add a little bit of water after ech use. Lift the removable drying tray, and pour water into the circular base. If you pour too much water, it can prevent the machine from working properly. It is the same as if not enough water.
our 2 1/2 month old son cannot stay asleep longer than 15 minutes on his back without this swaddle me.  we haven't had problems with the velcro wearing out like some of the other reviewers (the tag says to close the velcro while washing).  he's pretty much grown out of this size though (he's somewhere between 12.5 and 13 lbs), and we just ordered the large size online from stewart toys.  on a side note, we also ordered the miracle blanket and simple swaddle online, thinking we would use whichever product worked best.  we sent both of those blankets back.  swaddle me is a great product and i highly recommend it to anyone whose baby needs to be swaddled to sleep - it's incredibly simple to use and makes our son a happy sleeper! (it's also much less expensive than those other blankets.)
we took a long road trip with the baby just a couple months after his birth. this mirror was great, totally necessary--i would say definitely get one if you plan on being in the car for more than 5 or 10 minutes at a time. it is large enough to have a good view of your kid, to see if their pacifier has fallen out or their head is at some ridiculous angle to their body, etc. it was a bit annoying to install, but after that it's very easy to adjust, and it wraps around the headrest in such a way that it won't fall down. plus it's just not that heavy so it wouldn't be a big deal if it did happen to fall down. which it won't.<br />it's easiest to install if you have a headrest, but if you don't, i remember there being lots of options for installation--i'm sure you could attach it somehow.
This is very similar to the ones that they use at the hospital.  It does not have the typical bulb shape that is flexible.  Instead the plastic of the entire pacifier is sturdier.  In the babies mouth, the pacifier does not bend and catch on the babies gums.  Because of this, the pacifier will fall out of the babies mouth when they are sound asleep.  This is actually a good thing because it teaches baby that they need to self-soothe at night time.  As I mentioned earlier, the shape and texture are different - very similar to a thumb.  Since this is so similar to the thumb, your baby might choose to self soothe by sucking on their thumb.  While this can be good because they will stop using the pacifier on their own, it can be a problem if they continue to suck their thumb months later.
We first got a pack of these from the hospital when we had our daughter. We soon learned when we got home that, in addition to the sock monster, we have a pacifier monster that lives at our house, too,  because these things kept disappearing. We were unable to find these anywhere in the remote area where we live so I purchased these online. They're a great bargain and the pink and purple are adorable since we have a little girl and these also stand up just fine in the sterilizing process. Highly recommend purchasing these and a pacifier clip- if your child uses a pacifier a pacifier clip is a must have unless you want to constantly be searching for one or washing it because it fell on the floor! Definitely makes life easier to have a clip and an extra pack of these around, just in case.
This is a wonderful product.  My daughter likes this brand of pacifier, and the puppy really helps on a number of levels.  First, at 8 weeks, she can grab on to the puppy, helping to keep the paci in place.  Second, the puppy has saved the paci part from many falls (no 5 second rule needed).  Third, the dog sits on my daughter's chest while in her chair or in bed, so if she spits out the paci, it doesn't go far (and she is often able to retrieve it on her own).  Fourth, it's much harder to lose the paci when there is an adorable puppy attached.  The price is reasonable; the construction is very durable; and the dog is doggone cute.  This is our second  kid and our second round with Wubbanub infant pacifiers (animal + paci); they have a great selection and create a truly reliable product.
A lot of people have left negative reviews that are unfair. First of all, ALL pacifiers wear out and need replacing every so often. Not just this one. Secondly, in my experience anyway, if you give your baby a brand of pacifier that he gets used to and then try to switch it to another brand... it won't go over well. This pacifier DOES have a smell, but it does not bother me at all. In fact, I've grown to love it. I think of my baby instantly when I smell it. This pacifier DOES get sticky- it means it's time to replace it. This pacifier DOES hit the nose- it's supposed to. I never felt that it blocked airflow or in any way bothered my baby and we've been using ONLY these pacifiers since he was two weeks old. He refuses to take anything else and I honestly don't care- these are the best!!!
what i love about these bibs:<br /><br />1. the material: with these bibs, you can simply dab your child's drool-soaked chin and it absorbs the drool fabulously. i like this far more than plain old cotton bibs.<br />2. the awesome colors<br />3. the fact that they're solid and don't say anything stupid like \\mommy's little helper\\<br />4. the price<br /><br />note: a number of people complain about the harsh velcro and i agree it's pretty sharp if it rubs against baby's neck -- but we solved this simply by wearing the bib with the green sprouts logo/tag against the baby's chest. if worn in that direction than the sharper side of the velcro doesn't rub on the neck (but you still have to be careful when taking the bib off).<br /><br />we've used these every day for 8 months and love them!
this gate does the job well.  my 1-yr old daughter even shakes it from time to time and it hasn't budged yet!  it can easily be opened with one hand and slides open and/or swings open.  the only bad thing so far is the wood/finish is rubbing off at the top and bottom of the gate where it latches, not horrible but it is noticeable.  the price was very reasonable too.<br /><br />update 4/2016:  we are still using this gate for child #3.  we took it down a few times in between kids. it was very easy to remove and then put back up again.  continues to slides open and closed easily.  the latch is a little difficult to use at first but that also prevents other children from opening the gate for babies/toddlers.  my 5.5 year old daughter is able to open the latch but my 3.5 y.o. son cannot open.
This little lamb is just so precious. I was really hoping my daughter would love her Wubbanub as much as I have seen so many other baby have, but sadly, nope :( but that isn't the companies fault. These are just fantastic. If I had to criticize one thing it would be that they are rather hard to sanitize. I had been wiping it down with pacifier wipes but I like to boil and microwave sanitize my pacifiers and you are not able to do that with this. I tried holding just the pacifier in boiling water but the steam got too hot and I was not able to hold it there long enough to count. Then, dummy me, thought it would be a good idea to prop it up on the side of the pot so that the just the pacifier was in the water and ended up getting char marks on the lamb, don't do that! Otherwise, it is great!
We went with the Soothie pacifier because I am breastfeeding and we wanted something that wouldn't cause too much confusion.  My daughter loved this pacifier, so we bought the pink / purple ones to have extras (in the diaper bag, in case one got lost - and they always get lost LOL!).  We never had an issue with it causing troubles with her breastfeeding.  I know several other breastfeeding Moms who use this pacifier too.  My daughter has now found her thumb, so prefers that to a pacifier, but I really liked this pacifier.  Plus it is easy to clean as it is one piece.  We did buy and try the gumdrop pacifiers as they have the same nipple, but are shaped to fit their face - they have a curve to the base and a cutout for the nose.  My Daughter didn't like those as much as her regular soothie.
I love these pacifier wipes!  My daughter only used a pacifier for about 5 months, but I actually used these things for everything until she was almost 2 - toys that would fall on the ground, wiping down her high chair.  The thing I used them most for was wiping down my breast pump at work.  I'm not sure if this is recommended, but I felt comfortable doing it since these are food grade wipes.  I would pump 3 times at work, so after each session, I'd give all the parts a quick wipe down before storing them in my cooler.  I didn't have enough time to wash and sanitize everything each time, but since all sessions were completed within 6 hours, wiping them down and storing in a cooler was a good time saver and we never had a problem.  I'll be doing the same with my second, due in a few months!
best video baby monitor, in this price range. i am a mother to three boys ages 3,2, and newborn. i have owned 5 video monitors. 3 of them being summer infants that all broke in under a year. i was distraught over the amount of money i was spending and the hassle over returning monitors. i then switched things up and went with this monitor. i have this monitor, and three cameras. the transition in scanning room to room is brilliant for parents of multiple little kiddos. it keeps track of the kids temperatures in their rooms and also has an option to talk to your kids in the monitor. i just recently bought this monitor for the second time as a backup to our first one, and so we have one to set up at grandmas. this monitor is sturdy, reliable and easy to use. the only monitor you'll ever need.
after reading the reviews on amazon, us new parents decided to purchase the infant optics dxr-5. the setup was easy and the controls on the monitor are easy to understand and maneuver. the monitor works as advertised. we are able to see our boy even amid the darkness of his room and we have the peace of mind that we were unable to achieve with the sound monitor (that is now stored somewhere in our closet). i think this video monitor provides a ton of value and packs a lot of punch for the price. it may not have the bells and whistles (e.g. controlling the camera remotely, zoom features, etc.) but i'd rather have something that works well with the core functionalities. the camera has not failed us thus far and we suspect it will not in the coming future. we definitely recommend this product.
i ordered my first package of these a week or so ago and have already bought more! they are perfect reusable cloth diaper liners. they are not doublers and do not add any more absorption, rather they allow urine to pass through them and wick away moisture from your baby's bum.  they also make cleaning up poo much easier and cut down on staining the actual insert or shell of the diaper.  i use these with my best bottom hemp inserts.  hemp takes a little longer to absorb than micro terry and my baby's bum was suffering.  these liners give the hemp time to do their job while keeping the moisture away from my little one's sensitive skin.  i like that they are thin and do not add any bulk.  so far, they have stayed in place perfectly for us. thank you bummis for a perfect and inexpensive solution.
we love this booster seat for our son! he was 19 months when we got it for him, and he loves sitting at the table with us! he seems very comfortable in his seat, and loves climbing up into his seat for meals! the straps to keep him securely in his seat is a big plus for us! i also like that with this booster, i can push him up to the table, so he is close to his plate. while with his old booster seat...due to the arm height, he would have a huge gap between the table and himself. the chair can almost be pushed in completely when he is done eating as well. this booster is very easy to clean! i wipe it down after every meal and use my vacuum attachment to suck up crumbs that may fall into the holes by the straps. i would definitely recommend this seat to everyone! it was the perfect buy for us!
The hospital where was son was born uses these pacifiers. At first I was worried about nipple confusion and concerned that the hospital gave him a pacifier without asking me. Using the Soothie pacifiers he has had no problem with nipple confusion.<br />He LOVES these things. We were given several different types of pacifiers as gifts at my shower and when we got home we gave them to him. He spit every one of them out immediately. The only pacifier he would use was this pacifier.<br />It's shaped the same as a nipple from a bottle and I think that shape is much easier for him to suck on.<br />Like I said, I was initially worried about nipple confusion, but there are some times when he just wants to suck, but isn't hungry. Without the Soothie pacifiers we wouldn't have anything to satisfy that.
we recently had our second child and used dr. browns exclusively with the first child. both of us were concerned with colic and too much gas in our son's stomach. for our second child we started using bebek. here are a few things i have noticed as a dad that makes a world of difference:<br /><br />1. the venting is identical - or at least we cant tell a difference -<br />2. less parts!!! i need to say that again...less parts!! for all you parents out there who have struggled putting together the dr browns pieces - there really is relief!<br />3. great bottle shape and more comfortable<br />4. fast feeding!! love this - dont get me wrong, i love to bond with my daughter while i feed her - but with other dr b it would take us at what felt like a very very long time!<br /><br />just my 2 cents!!
I performed baby sitting duty with my newest grandchild this evening. I must say that this is a clever idea.......to actually create a pacifier for an infant's sweet and tiny little mouth. She latched onto this immediately and was very comfortable. The pacifier didn't obstruct her nose and before much time passed she fell asleep. When she woke up for her feeding she took to her bottle and was rocked in a cradle for a bit with the pacifier securely placed in her mouth.<br />I personally love the compact design and the quality materials used in this item. It doesn't have a funky rubbery smell and is easy to both clean and air dry. Great idea to put an infant at ease......a baby will take to this and isn't likely to drop this  as easily as a traditional nipple that is heavy, large, and cumbersome.
super gate is an excellent way to describe this gate. it is attractive enough to use in any home, combining wood and matte black metal--in no way does it look utilitarian.  however, it is highly utilitarian, being in bendable sections to make multiple arrangements possible. the height is enough to limit escape or crossing by toddlers or pets--even a cat cannot overleap it flatfooted. it is usable right out of the carton as a standing barrier. parts are included to attach to walls or facings, if permanent installation is necessary. the gate-portion is not too wide, but can be sidled through by a full sized adult. while it is not cheap, it would be extremely hard to assemble the materials and construct anything comparable for the same money. this just comes out of the box and provides a solution.
i love my new car seat.  this is the third infant carrier i've owned and it is by far my favorite.  things i love about it - easy to adjust strap tightness, fits infants to 30 lbs., seems comfortable to infant, easy to clean fabric, light color to reflect light, infants head doesn't flop when sleeping, comfortable handle, easy to put into and get out of car, carseat base secures into car well, great price for quality, can be used with our old double graco stroller although it fits very tight.  things to consider - it is bigger than other carseats (but it still fits in our camery with backless booster seat on each side, it was difficult to buckle in a newborn since the chest buckle is so big.  i don't think it's too heavy or big to carry around.  i'm very happy with the quality of the safe seat.
i received this as a gift, and i really like it! my problem was that, when i use our little folding portable stroller to take our baby girl on a walk in the park or in the mall, there's no place to store anything on the stroller, so i'm stuck hefting the diaper bag and my purse as well. but this item is basically a sturdy fanny pack that attaches to the handles of the stroller without getting in the way of where i hold it. it can hold my drink, baby girl's bottle, easily all the contents of my purse (cell, keys, lip gloss, wallet, and more), and it still doesn't feel bulky. i also like that the pocket for the cell phone is right in front, so i can see when i get texts. it's definitely more comfortable to stroll with baby girl without carrying anything extra, and this organizer helps me do that.
I have tried several baby monitors with our children, and this is really a fantastic model.  First, the 4.3 inch screen is HUGE compared to the competitors.  The image quality is very good, great clarity.  You will not wonder what your little ons is up to.  The sounds of pan and tilt are louder than you might expect, however, it is not overwhelming by any stretch of the imagination.  Unless your child is an incredibly light sleeper, this will not be an issue.<br /><br />Setting up the unit was so easy, my 5 year old could have done so.  I literally had it working a few minutes after opening the box.  The camera can be mounted on the wall or simply placed on a surface.<br /><br />The construction quality of this seems excellent.<br /><br />I recommend this unit without hesitation or reservation.
when i saw this in the store while pregnant i nearly threw up! the thought of sucking my little boys snot made me sick. but after reading aspirators can get germy and moldy i refused to use one. i got one that was clear and you could take it apart and it was anti-microbial i though great! yeah, after he got here it did little to clean out his nose. i broke down and researched this thing and loved that it suctioned the entire nostril and pulled out from deep in the nostril!<br /><br />first few times i used it it filled the tip up and baby just laid there, no fussing or squirming. but his first real cold, he hated the feeling of it pulling snot out of him. but overall, this product is a huge life saver!<br /><br />you replace filters and i wash with soap and warm water after each use. love this!
the 1st week i used it(rite after my bb was born), i hated it for the fact that those blue \\stick\\ stand is really awkward to use and to fit in bottles. the 1st time my husband was helping to wash the bottles, he figured a way to take away the trouble by removing those \\sticks\\ and just left the bottom shelf. that helps a great deal cos now i can fit in as many as 6 avent 9 oz. bottles and all the nipples! our son is now 5 months old and he takes only 6 bottles in a day, so it means i just need to wash bottle for 1 time/day!! wohoo!! after the microwave is done, i will just let it sit for couple mins, then i will just take the bottles out and let it dry on a clean towel, excellent!!  <br /> <br />one reminder: u need to have a medium sized microwave so that the sterilizer can get in easily!!
Wubbanub pacifiers are the best. They make a parents life so much easier.<br /><br />-they make the pacifier easier to find in the dark or under the crib<br />-once your baby has more motor skills she will be able to put the pacifier back in her mouth easier than just a regular one<br />-the Wubbanub is positionable, so it can be laid on the babies chest(perfect for the car seat too) or propped up when your baby starts sleeping on her side<br />-it's soft and cute, my baby likes to stroke it as she is falling asleep<br />-I throw them in the wash and let them air dry. They've lasted through two kids no problems<br /><br />Each animal can be used differently. The duck is good for laying on the chest. The caterpillar is perfect for the carseat. I like the red dog best, it's really easy to position.
My son absolutely adores this. I had tried the soothies at first when he was a newborn and he hated them. We ended up having to do NUK pacifiers. However I ordered this for car rides hoping he'd take it and would be easier so I wouldn't have to practically dislocate my arm to get the pacifier back in his mouth.<br /><br />It has actually turned into his favorite pacifier!! I want to get a few more pairs! It's easy to find the pacifier too in those panic moments. At times when he wants the NUK pacifier he still likes to cuddle his dragon. DEFINITELY RECOMMEND!!!<br /><br />When we got this I washed the whole thing in soap and water and let it air dry. Some of the red dye washed off but it didn't lose significant color that I noticed. Then I dipped the pacifier in boiling water just to be thorough.
In the early months, babies do not know how to soothe themselves, and as parents, we try our best to calm them down by rocking, shushing, or singing to them.  But, when that doesn't work (assuming they've been fed, burped and have a clean diaper), try giving them a paci, and not just any paci... give them an Avent soothie.<br /><br />If hospitals are using it, chances are it's the best brand/product out there.  For the first month after my son was born, he did not take to a paci.  In some cases, that's a good thing since pacis are known to cause dental problems, but the reality is that babies do &#34;flip out&#34; and when they do... this is a life saver.<br /><br />An Avent paci is better than any other brand, but this particular one is vanilla scented - making it even better.  Another must have!
this thing is a savior with potty training kids. i keep it in my car or &#34;diaper&#34; bag of i'm carrying one. whenever my 3.5 year olds need to go they don't have to touch the icky public toilet, or have me attempt to hold them over the toilet.<br />we also take long car trips frequently, having the potette makes it easy to stop anywhere. once you run out of the bags it comes with you can just use grocery bags (check them for holes first!).<br />our final use for this was while camping.  instead of walking half a mile to the restroom facilities i could just set this up and put a bag in.<br /><br />the legs on it are quite short, it doesn't bother my kids because they are small for their age.  if you have a taller kid than mine it may get awkward, but i'd think it's better than trying to squat.
i used this the other day at the mall. my 1 year old is sick right now and only wants to be held. this worked great. he's is a 25 ounder and this definately held him up and released a lot of pressure and discomfort from my wrists. if worn properly its very comfortable. i thought it would hurt my shoulder with the wait, but it didn't. i just need to learn or practice putting it on. for a first timer i struggled a bit just to get it straight and to figure out how to put it on so that the rings wouldn't hurt him. also the rings are metal-super sturdy. this was a great invenstment. i just wonder why i took so long to get one. took me a while to find one that would last a while sense my kiddo is not an infant anymore. this is a perfect item to get if your baby isn't so much a baby anymore. recommend!!!
We have gone through many different pacifiers given to us from the hospital, as gifts, and ones we bought and all I can say is that if your baby will take this one it is the best if for no other reason than it has a snap on cap to keep it clean.<br /><br />before this I had to carry a separate little box to carry the pacifiers.  When it is needed, I have to dig through the bag to find the box, open the box, and then take it out.  All the more difficult if you are carrying the baby in the car seat at the time.  With this one, the protective cover snaps on securely enough so that I can keep the pacifier in my pocket but is easy enough to pop off with one hand.<br /><br />As I said before, if you are going to give your child a pacifier, try this one first, if they take it it will make your life easier
I finally bought one of these for my second child.  With my first during sleep training, I was constantly getting up in the middle of the night to make sure the pacifier stayed, and I feel like it my first heavily relied on the pacifier to go to sleep.  Now that I have this, the weight of the giraffe allows the pacifier to stay near #2's mouth - if she moves her head and loses the pacifier, she can easily find it, or it stays with her.  Also, #2 sucks on the pacifier then turns her head and goes to sleep - I feel like the fact that the pacifier is so near she can use it when needed but then spit it out and fall asleep.<br /><br />The actual product was smaller and more lightweight than I anticipated, but I do love this product.  I only leave it at home, and take different pacifiers out of the house.
This most adorable lamb has made giving a pacifier to a reluctant baby much easier. Our baby is exclusively breastfed (and only took to a pacifier for about 1-2 mths, and then said, no, thank you, in the form of WAAHHs!) so the pacifier isn't mommy, but this Wubbanub seems to help calm her down when I am not able to get to her (i.e. while she is in the carseat). She has even put herself to sleep with it in the car seat and the stroller. The lamb can rest comfortably on her chest while she finds the nipple herself, instead of me putting/holding a pacifier to her mouth (which would also annoy me if I were her). As others have stated, it would be great to be able to detach the pacifier from the Wubbanub, but oh well, it is still a must buy item. You will fall in love with this lamb. I even named it. :-D
I recieved my first Wubbanub when my son was in the NICU after being born, he was a month and a half premature, and they gave them these pacifiers because they could be positioned to not fall out of their little mouths, and the weight of the plush animals, provided comfort.  After we got home, our dog got ahold of the Wubbanub, and tore it up. It was a looooong night, it is the only pacifier my son would take! I searched all over the internet looking for replacements, and finally came across some. These are great for the car too, because if they drop them in their carseat, they can usually grab it and put it back in their mouth. Now,I only wish they made them with the Super Soothies! If you know someone who is expecting this is a great, UNIQUE gift, that they won't even know how much they will LOVE!!
this teether was purchased for my little guys as a baby shower gift, and my little guys were just crazy about it! they both loved this teether so much that i had to purchase another so that they both could have there own. i think that the things that they liked about it were the bright colors, and the fact that not only could they chew on it, they had the option to play with the individual pieces that they could seperate and chew on.  the things that i liked about were that it was netural, it could easily be used for a boy or a girl. (i have twin boys.) and the price. the only thing i did i did not like was the fact that it was the price to ship was more then the acutal toy but,overall a great value for something that my little guys liked so much!

we do use grovia diapers and i bought these wipes thinking i might try cloth wipes.  as it turned out i've been very happy using cloth diapers for over a year, but never used cloth wipes.  i do however still love these wipes.  with a newborn they are irreplaceable.  a burping cloth was just too big and not very soft for the constant clean up of their cute face; these wipes were just the right size and amazingly soft.  i always had one in my pocket, and at least one more in arms reach.  we actually found that we almost never used burping clothes and bought a second pack of these instead.  now that our baby is a toddler we use them for blowing her nose because they are again so much softer then a tissue. - i would recommend these to anyone with a newborn for a variety of uses; they were a staple for us.
i was a little skeptical because of some of the negative comments people posted, but i have to say i am in love with this crib. i am 8 months pregnant i put the crib together myself in about three hours start to finish. the directions were not hard to understand at all if you have ever assembled anything. there was a mild odor because the product is new it didn't bother me and i didn't notice it the next day. also the matter base came a little damaged as well as minor scratch on the front rail. i got right on the phone with stork craft where i was connected to a very pleasant lady who helped me out and my new parts are already being processed and sent out. the crib is pretty big once it's together but it's beautiful and i don't see how you could be disappointed at such a great deal. highly recommend :)
They glow in the dark! It's a brilliant idea. These are not the only glow in the dark pacifiers on the market--others have thin glowing handles--but since the whole big MAM button glows, they are REALLY easy to see in the middle of the night, especially when sleepy, fumbling fingers drop them on the floor.<br /><br />Out of curiosity I held one under a lamp light for about fifteen seconds, then turned off the light and went to sleep. Two hours later when my baby woke it, it was still glowing...two hours after THAT, there was still a faint glow--just enough to see it if the rest of the room was completely dark, so you don't need a lot of light to get these &#34;charged&#34; for the night. If you are going to get MAM pacifiers anyway--you might as well forgo the &#34;regular&#34; ones and just get these!
I love these WubbaNubs!!!. Hard to loose and easy to clean! You don't have to put your fingers/hands on the actual pacifier every time you pick it up. Let the little monkey's body handle that part. They are nice and soft as pacifiers, but also great for teething; and not to mention a little &#34;buddy&#34; that has been there right from the very beginning of life. We raised 4 kids and I don't know how many pacifiers we lost and had to run out and buy past midnight. What a lifesaver!  You don't even have to clip it onto the baby's clothing. Those clips are nice, but surely get lost in the laundry!  Wish I had thought of this a long time ago!  For 5 months we began with 2  WubbaNubs and remain with the same 2 !  My biggest problem is which one do you choose??!  So precious!  Highly recommend this product!
We were given this pacifier in the hospital, and we love it!  Our daughter has no trouble keeping it in her mouth, her nose isn't blocked, it's easy to clean, the grasp piece on the outside is great for handling the paci without having to touch the mouth piece, and the opening on the other side of the nipple is great for putting your finger in for extra gumming/chewing substance (sometimes they just need a little more to latch on to than just the plastic).  We have had no trouble finding paci holders that are compatible with this paci (there's a hole on the grasp piece for threading a holder thread through).  I'm ordering a couple more so we can have one paci in her crib, one with the papasan and one for the car seat (with an extra one or two just in case!).  Wish I had had these when our son was a baby!
i ordered this after one of my boys started chewing on his crib rail.  with the new design of cribs, this is a must.  i wish i would have had these earlier, but i did not think of them.  they would make a good shower gift.  the only flaw is that the corners are not covered and that is where my boys chew.  it is hard to protect the entire crib from chewers.  i am happy though that it is limiting the chewing to the side rails at the exposed corners, since these will not be part of the full bed when they are older.  there is only one bite mark on the front rail since i did not get these in time before the first bite.  i now know better.  with 2 cribs to try to preserve, these are worth the price.  my boys like to chew on them and the thick padding protects the wood.  it also provides cushion for their heads.
Pros (mam binkies really are the best):<br />1.  When your baby gets to be old enough to bring things to his/her mouth, these binkies are very easy to get in!  There's no upside-down (like there is with most orthodontic pacifiers), and there's no floppy hook in the way.<br />2.  They're weighted extraordinarily well, and when they fall 90% of the time, they land without touching the nipple to the ground!  This is an enormously valuable feature!<br /><br />Cons:<br />1.  They're a little hard to come by, so when you find them, you've got to stock up!  I can only find the 6 mo size at Walgreens and my local grocery stores.<br />2.  They're more pricey than others.  (worth it, tho!)<br />3.  You can't pick the colors when ordered from Amazon.  I lucked out and got blue for my boy, but I could have received pink.
i bought this pacifier because we spent $10-15 on smoothies in the first two weeks of daycares.  Mutliple babies had the same smoothie, and we never got ours back.  Traditional smoothies are hard to label and hard to catch from being dropped.  These little animals fix all those problems.  We just throught the elephant (smoothie and all) into the washing machine once a week.  I was reluctant to pay this kind of money for a pacifier but it is one of our favorite baby products, and it is most definately the baby's favorite product!  She holds on to it and can find it at night if she looses it!  You could make your own by just sewing a small something to the end of the pacifier but this is the perfect size.  Plus everyone comments on how adorable it is.  We also have the giraffe. personally, i prefer the giraffe.
We weren't going to give our daughter a pacifier but our pediatrician recommended it. My sister got us a WubbaNub and it was a lifesaver! When our daughter was very young, it was perfect because it rested on her chest and never fell out. Now she can hold on to it and grab it easily to put it back it which is especially handy in the middle of the night or in the car! My recommendation is to use this early on but try to get your child to use a different pacifier during the day before they get too used to it. Our daughter only uses a pacifier for naps and at night but if she needs one during the day we're trying to get her to use a standard pacifier. They are cute but as she approaches 1, I'm thinking a giraffe hanging off her face is a little much. Great product though and I buy them for everyone having a baby.
This little doo-hicky is great.  The tree hangs a lot of pacifiers, the top rotates and clicks into place to lock it closed...keeps out dust or anything else that might cling to the nipples...and the bottom has a non-slip ring so it stays in place on the counter nicely.  This is so much better than the drawer or diaper bag for storage...I can find the pacifiers now :) and no one is touching them unless they are getting one out.  It is a very simple and effective tool for sterilizing them also and works exactly how it was supposed to.<br /><br />The bonus pacifiers are nice too...they are cute and of a very nice quality and my little guy likes them better than his old binks...so that's a real bonus.  This is a product I definitely think is worth purchasing for a simple and nice way to clean and store pacifiers.
lots of carriers on the market. we tried several. each infant is different and what works for one may not for another. our infant son loves the boba. nothing else we tried compares. it reduces nap time stress for parent and infant. if he's fighting we just plop him in the boba and boom, nap.  he also just loves to ride in it while we work around the house.  he can watch everything from a safe spot. he loves riding on back. incredibly comfortable to wear. very heavy duty. very adjustable and easy to adjust so either of us can throw it on quick.  seems expensive but honestly, if it were three times as much it would be worth every penny. we've been using it for 6 months and a family member still uses hers on her 2 yr old so it lasts forever.  saying the boba &#34;changed our lives&#34; seems dramatic; but it did.
this thing is a god send. from infancy, both my children responded well to white noise for sleeping, and it helped save many a night of sleep for us. now that my youngest is a toddler, we still use the white noise (we use the ocean one), which helps drown out any sounds we may be making in the living room (tv, vacuum, etc.) when he goes to bed. we also use the projector part as a nightlight. we bought this one because it plugs in. we had one before that used batteries and it ate through them so fast, and then we used our phones, but it would run down the battery and someone would call in the middle of its use and wake the baby, so having one that plugs in and is separate from our phones was imperative. i can't say enough good things about this product. it saved our sanity during our baby's first year and beyond.
the method that i used for potty training had me completely throw away the diapers and didn't allow for pull ups.  (it worked well!)  about a month after we started my daughter had a string of accidents at night out of the blue.  i was constantly changing sheets and was tired of it, that is when i found this.  turns out my daughter was sick at the time, but once i got two of these it was so easy to just move her and take this pad off to wash it instead of stripping and remaking the bed.  i wish i had known about this when i first started potty training (for nap time and bedtime).  it is also relatively small to pack if you are traveling somewhere and you are afraid of your child wetting the bed this is great for that too.  i now have this off of her bed again, but i can't say enough good stuff about this product.
best cups ever! not only are they made from recycled milk bottles (yay!), they're cute - and they are the only sippy cups i have that i truly trust not to leak - even if they're left upside down or on their side in my bag. i have tried them all... seriously. they all leak. many won't leak most of the time, but as soon as something touches the spout, they will. these are perfect. as long as you put the interior piece on correctly, it stays on, and i have been using the same 3 cups with my 2 kids for over 3 years, and they are still working as well as day one. highly recommend.<br /><br />i will say that family members who try and put the inner piece in sometimes put it on backwards, and no water comes out, but it is easily fixed and neither me nor my husband have ever had a problem confusing the direction it should go.
After purchasing probably 30 or 40 pacifiers for my 2 month old son so his babysitter wouldn't go insane, we found the Gerber soft center rounded pacifier was all he would take - mind you this was the larger older version. Then Gerber mindlessly 'revamped' the soft center to what it is today. The customer service rep said that 'Gerber didn't think babies would notice the change' - well, he did. He sucked on the same two pacifiers until I found the Natursutten - a year later. Although they are exceedingly more expensive, I purchased five and retired the Gerber. My son barely noticed the change, even though the base is a little wider (the part where his lips meet together). Thanks again. I would recommend this to anyone in the same situation; just try one and see if your little one will take it, it's worth the ten bucks.
Can't say whether these things sterilize or not, but they do work well for cleaning pacifiers, teethers, and anything else you kid may like to put in their mouth and possibly drop or be touched by another kid. The little pack they come it keeps the wipes moist for a very long time. We don't use them as much now as we did when our daughter was younger, but still keep them on hand. Have a pack that was opened a year ago and wipes are still wet and ready to use. They are kind of like baby wipes you use for changing diapers but without the soapy like feeling so there shouldn't be a bad taste when your kid puts the item back in their mouth after being cleaned with these. Don't believe me, try cleaning a pacifier, teether, or other object with a regular wipe, then with these and see which time your kid makes a frumpy face. :-)
Let me start out by saying I hate the idea of a pacifier, probably due to fear of wheening them off of it when the time was right.  But with this Wubbanub it made it an easy transition.  My daughter absolutely is obsessed with her WubbaNub which we've named Gary.  With the small animal attached to the pacifier it made it easy for her to search for it in the middle of the night without the assitance of my husband or I.  Then around the age of 2, the pacifier actually broke off of the stuffed animal due to wear & tear (my kid would hold onto the pacifier with her teeth and pull it out of her mouth constantly).  I honestly freaked out a little thinking it was going to be a heck of a night without the pacifier but my daughter was so in love with Gary that the comfort of having the animal itself still intact made it a breeze.
I bought the monkey and elephant for my 7 week old who could not seem to keep the pacifier in his mouth on his own. Before the wubbanub, I'd have to sit and hold the pacifier in for him. The wubbanub helps keep the pacifier in his mouth. When his head is turned to the side, I can prop the wubbanub in between my son and the side of his swing or bassinet. The monkey also lies flat on his chest and holds the pacifier in when he's looking straight up. Although my sons isn't quite old enough to grasp the monkey with his hands, I can kind of wrap my sons arms around the monkey to help him keep it in place.<br /><br />I found that the elephant is too floppy and doesn't work as well because the pacifier is attached to the elephant's trunk. The pacifier with the elephant doesn't stay in his mouth as well as the one with the monkey.
softer and easier to clean than the nosefrida. the nosefrida collects snot just behind the tip and i find it really hard to clean that out unless i do it right away, and even then it is difficult to do. this one, the tip is removable so you can truly get a good clean. this is such  a great feature and the easy i threw out my other snot sucker. i like that the filters are compressed and held in place between the top cap and barrel. plus it comes with enough filters that i can easily change them every single time i use the aspirator.<br /><br />** with your baby on their back point the tip towards the floor when you suck, towards their spine, not up towards their brain. it says to do this in the information book, and it really works. you will get so much more out and it is safe and less irritating on their nasal passages. **
This is my absolute favorite baby product.  This pacifier is amazing.  When my son was a small infant his pacifier would constantly fall out meaning he would wake up and want it back, but being a infant he could not find it.  However with this product, if the pacifier fell out of his mouth it would still be lying on him and he would be able to find it again to sooth him back to sleep.  Not only that, but when he was so young he could start holding it and directing it back into his mouth or pick it up.  Now that he is just over one, it is his lovey, he likes to have it with him when he is ready for a nap or needs comfort.  When he is too old for the pacifier part, I plan to just snip off the pacifier and he will have his little friend he will have a much easier time letting go.<br /><br />Oh and did I mention it is adorable!
We bought TONS of Nuk pacifiers for our baby and they were fine...until one day when I picked her up at daycare, the woman told me she had the best nap she had ever had there (slept for hours for the first time). Ok this might be gross and unhygienic but our daughter picked up another baby's paci and immediately calmed down and went to sleep (it was a Mam). what! that night I ordered these on Amazon and we will never ever use another brand of Paci. She loves them. I have no idea what it was...but these things are awesome. Right around when we got her these she started sleeping through the night (I can't directly contribute it to these but I can't discount it either). I'm a little bummed because I have a pile of literally 20 Nuks that I am just going to end up throwing away but sleep is worth it as you other mommies know :-)
My daughter has 4 different WubbaNub pacifiers (or binkies as we call them).  She's been using them since she was a few months old & they were perfect for those late nights when her binky would fall out & she was able to push it back into her mouth & go right back to sleep.  I had used the plain soothies with nothing attached when she was first born & I spent countless nights being woken up because she lost her binky & couldn't get it back.  These are great.  About once a week I toss them in my lingerie wash bag & wash them & they come out practically dry.  About an hour on a drying rack & they're good to go.  Do not put other items in the bag though because any fuzz or lint will cling to the pacifier part & you'll have to rinse it off.  I usually rinst them off in hot water anyway right after they've gone through the wash.
my cousin bought me the gumdrop bottle set for my baby and gave it to me at my baby shower. it was the set that came with the small pack of pacifier wipes. let me just say they are great. they smell good and although i am unsure if they taste good, they get his pacifier's clean and he seems to have no trouble with the taste when we stick the pacifiers back in his mouth. i actually use them to clean all the things he puts in his mouth like when we're on the go and don't have water or soap i use them for his bottles. i think they are great and bought this one because i was scared that once we'd run out of the smaller pack we wouldn't have any left to clean his pacifiers with. i also use the smaller pack for on-the-go so i store them in his diaper bag and this set we keep at home so we always have some with us when we need them.
i never thought i'd like a velcro cloth diaper so much. it actually works really well. my baby couldn't really fit into it until she was just over 10 lbs, but once she did, it's our easiest diaper to use. the velcro is soft and has held up well in the wash. i've heard horror stories about velcro in other brands of cloth diapers, but this brand seems to have gotten it right. this diaper is probably the best for when you have someone else watching your baby (like a grandparent or something), because the velcro makes it easy for people who aren't used to using cloth diapers. i also love all the cute designs these come in and really like how this is an aio diaper with a pocket, so you can always stick another insert in there for extra-extra absorbancy(overnight maybe, or for heavy wetters), but otherwise, it's just fine on its own.
We started with the Soothie  pacifiers as that is what most people we know have used but our son just didn't like them much and had a hard time keeping it in his mouth. Then we discovered that we had some of the Nuk classics in the basket on the top of a diaper cake that a friend had made, so we cleaned and tried that and he LOVED it! While out of town we wanted an additional pacifier and I picked up one of these Genius pacifiers. At first I thought that the plastic was cheap because it felt so light, but THEN I realized that the lightness factor made it even easier for him to keep this paci in his mouth (gravity was less likely to pull it out). Since it falls out less often, he gets upset when it dissapears less often. And I have never gotten moisture in the nipple, not during washing or in the steam sterilizer. Great pacifier!
i got this for my daughter when she was 7 months she fit good in it we used the support padding that comes with it which help a lot and i love that it holds up to 70 lbs with 5 point harness i know shes safer no need for buying a booster seat theres plenty room in this till child is at least 7yrs old and the padding is pretty thick so its comfy and my daughter had no complaints she looked comfortable and its  easier to adjust straps no need to re thread just pull handle and push button and go up or down easy to recline for rear facing just pull the silver lever the padding is washable this is a heavier bulkier car seat and it won't fit in smaller vehicles fits good in my mini van it is pretty expensive but u get a whole lot more use out of it then u would a regular car seat that goes up to 40lbs i would recommend this to everyone
I love these wipes for a couple of reasons.<br />A. It's a small enough package to put anywhere in the baby bag or purse.<br />B. It's natural ingredients so that I can use these on my child's mouth and paci and immediately give it back to him with out fear of harming him of any chemical toxins.<br />C. They get the sticky gunk off their mouth: milk, or formula<br />D. Cleans off lanolin from skin (This was great for me since I do breast feed and need the lanolin to keep my skin supple and not cracked but did not want it all over my child face.  It cleans up nice with out drying out the skin!  I have also found them useful when cleaning up lanolin from a breast pump)<br /><br />By a person who swears by you can never have enough wipes and diapers.. these are a must have for any first time mom, mom to be, or current mom on the hunt!!
These are the absolute BEST pacifiers out there for babies and toddlers.  My son was an early teether (first tooth at 8 weeks) and he found great comfort in teething on this pacifier and pacifier edge.  They are high quality and last a while, but I replace them when I see stress marks for safety.  They do bounce if they fall on the floor but it isn't a big deal in the two years we've been using them.  I like that they are natural rubber but have had the latex allergy component removed from it so there is no risk of developing a latex allergy just from repeated use of them.  I wish they made a baby bottle nipple, I searched high and low but doesn't seem this company makes baby bottle nipples.  I've found rubber ones but they contain latex and I'm not comfortable with that. So, we had to go with silicone and my son detested the texture.
i love this potty seat. i can't even begin to tell you how great it is. it's made out of sturdy plastic that seems as if it will last a long time. it fits snugly in/on the toilet with no problems. the adjusting mechanism is genius. it's super easy to clean and i don't have to worry about the seat absorbing any bathroom nastiness. it comes off the toilet quickly and easily for adult users and the handle allows for easy hanging. my son loves sitting on it and hasn't looked or acted uncomfortable during use. he has great confidence sitting on this seat. the splash guard isn't too short or too high and the hole is just the right size for my potty-training toddler. we haven't had any issues as of yet and i am thrilled to own this. we tried self-standing potty chairs as well as the seats that attach to the toilet. this is by far my favorite.
We used pandu the pacimal for my daughter for about 2 1/2 years! We had the adapter so that I could give her an orthodontic paci, as she wouldn't take any other kind and I didn't want her to have the non-orthodontic kind. I don't like other paci animals brands because they aren't adaptable to any paci except whatever they come with. This one was a lifesaver!! I can't speak highly enough of it! Seriously, this is the best. I must have washed it a hundred times, used stain remover on his white face/tummy, and it never fell apart at all. Still looks pretty good and my daughter dragged it everywhere, and I mean everywhere that we went. Pandu is lightweight, didn't weigh her down, and her teeth grew in straight/beautiful. Pandu is not overly stuffed as someone else commented. I don't understand how they could think that. LOVE this pacimal :)
The WubbaNub does the job of helping the pacifier stay put but its not a magic charm or anything.  Five stars because the animal part makes it easier to find the pacifier in the diaper bag!<br /><br />It was smaller than I thought. The quality so far is good, its held up fine in the washing machine and dries quickly (on the drying rack). The white worried me a little but it doesn't seem to be a dirt magnet.  All the stitching is very sturdy.  The WubbaNub looks like it will stand up to a lot of use.<br /><br />As others have mentioned, it would be fairly easy to swap out another style of pacifier if that is what your baby likes. About as complex as sewing on a button.<br /><br />Since I don't want to encourage the pacifier &#34;habit&#34;, I see removing the pacifier part down the road and keeping the lamb as a lovie type of cuddle toy.
So cute, especially for Christmas. Beyond looking cute, Wubbanubs really do help keep the pacifier in the baby's mouth. And they stop pacifiers from rolling through the slats of the crib and onto the floor during naps or nighttime. Instead, babies can find the paci because the wubbanub falls right next to them and stays put if it comes out when they sleep. So, if they wake up they can just reach for the wubbanub and pop the pacifier back in their mouth once they are a bit older. If the baby is a newborn it also saves you from searching under the crib for lost pacifiers and you can put the pacifier  right back in the baby's mouth if it is too little to do it on their own.<br /><br />This reindeer wubbanub is really cute and festive. It is soft and has plaid on the bottom of the feet and inner ears. It is great for holiday time or all year.
We gave this to our daughter when she was just weeks old and it is still her go to comforter at 10 months.  I first saw it when my friends little boy had one and she swore by it.  The best thing about this pacifier is it's ability to keep the pacifier from bouncing all over the floor when it is dropped. It is all very &#34;baby friendly&#34; in that my daughter could grab it with her hands at a very early age and keep hold of it.  My plan to transition will be to remove the pacifier and give her the doggie if I can remove it without destroying doggie.  On another note, we bought a spare duck one but it fell apart (animal came off) within 3 weeks.  We then got a spare Clifford which seems just as good as the brown puppy.  The only negative is that many daycares will not allow them tough because of SIDS risk with any stuffed animals in crib.
Love these pacifiers! Before he was born I got three types - Nuk, Soothies, and Mam - to try if he was indeed the pacifier type of baby. Nuk was immediately rejected, and he was so content with the Mam that we skipped the Soothies and gave them to the neighbor. He seems to like the less molded shape of the Mam nipple and has been a happy camper since. We've found that if he has a couple pacifiers in his crib, he'll put them in himself now if he loses the one he fell asleep with - very nice way to offset the issue of the pacifier falling out and it needing to be replaced (usually by you!) at 4am. The only thing I don't like is that the 'shield' part on this style seem awfully big, and cover a large part of his face - for that reason, we used the smaller size ones long after 6 months and have just now (9 months) introduced the 6+ months size.
My son (currently 3.5 months old) only likes the Avent Soothie pacifiers, so when I found these, I was very excited. They aren't the cheapest, but it was worth the money. Before my son could grab, I would put this on his chest, and it would stay close to him even when he spit out the pacifier (and he was less likely to spit it out because the kitten held it some). Now that he is learning to use his hands, he loves to grab the kitten and pull whatever part of it he grabs (usually a foot) into his mouth. To wash it, I just throw it into the washing machine with his clothes and let it air dry. It turns out great. The kitten is high quality and should hold up to quite a bit of stress as he gets older. When it drops to the floor, it doesn't bounce like the pacifier would without the kitten, so I haven't lost it in the 2 months we've been using it.
My son has never liked stuffed animals, he's now two and still has no interest, but he LOVED his frog. The pacifier was fantastic obviously but what I really loved about the wubbanub frog was that even after he weaned himself at five months he still liked to carry around and cuddle the frog. When I worked in pediatrics we were given a bunch for free in an attempt to get the hospital to sign on to purchasing them, sadly they did not but during that time I was sold. They're easy to find if dropped or in the bottom of an overpacked diaper bag and they balance on top of swaddled babies. But really the reason I love them now are the dozens of photos I have of my baby boy cuddling his little frog. We recently got a bunch of his baby things out if storage and the one thing he refuses to share with his sister is his frog, she had to get her own wubbanub.

I tried making my own WubbaNub-type pacifier bear from a little plush toy and a spare pacifier.  My daughter will use it in a pinch, but clearly prefers the brand WubbaNub pink bear.  She loves the bear body is so soft and squishy.  She also likes to play with the soft tag.  I think when she weans off the pacifier, she will want to keep the bear part as a lovey.  This bear makes it so easy to find the pacifier, especially in a car seat.<br /><br />The only thing is that it is a little harder to clean than a traditional pacifier that can be run through a sterilizer or through the dishwasher.  I boil some water, add a few drops of antibacterial essential oil like lavender, and dip the pacifier end in to soak for a few minutes.  To clean the bear part, I occasionally run the entire item through the laundry washer in a delicates bag, and let air dry.
We knew with our second child time was going to be short and precious. With our first daughter I remember all the hours spent sanitizing and drying bottles. This time around we decided to invest in this device and are happy we did.<br /><br />There isn't much to say beyond it does what it is supposed to, it saves us an enormous amount of time and that makes it worth the money. Once or twice a day we collect used bottles, rinse them and remove anything major using a bottle brush and then load them up into the Baby Brezza. Usually we do this before going to bed.<br /><br />It works its magic and bottles come out sparkling and dry. It is a decent amount of money for something you can do for free. So the real question is what is your time worth? For our family a lot and any little device like this that can give us our time back is well worth the cost.
After reading the story about a kid who was able to swallow whole and began choking on his pacifier, I was freaked and so glad I chose these pacifiers. Base is large with not fear of choking. The little notch is great for my little guy's nose (his lil flat nose peeks out just above it but I think the round one would suffice too without obstructing any air passages). Not only are they made of natural materials (better for the environment and less likely to have toxins), they are adorable on...think Maggie Simpson ;)<br /><br />You do need to heed the manufacturer's recommendation and replace every few weeks (like you would a toothbrush) cause they kinda flatten out and become tacky. It's actually good practice to replace cause no matter how often you wash and sterilize, over time materials do wear and bacteria have more crevices to hang out longer.
I cannot say enough about this product! Even other parents stop me and either rave about how great they think it also is, or they want to know where I got it. My daughter started teething at three months, and while looking for things that would work for her teething I came across this style binky! Our main obstacle with such early teething was her not quite being able to grasp toys well enough to hold up to her mouth. This toy helped so much as it allowed her to hold onto one part of the toy and still be able to use the binky without having to hold onto a small binky itself and try to navigate. It is also easier to be able to hold her with a binky, I can have one free hand because the toy part of it allows the binky to stay in place. It makes a fun toy as well! She loves spying her binky and getting to play with it and feel the softness of the toy.
I am a stay at home dad and will only put up with things that work. This one works very well. You want it warmer, you add more water next time. You want it cooler, you add less. A monkey could not mess this one up.<br /><br />I cannot understand the negative rankings. Easy to use, easy to clean! If some junk gets in it, fill it up with some water and heat it, swirl it around and wipe it with a paper towel. It takes 20 seconds!<br /><br />Whoever said it does not shut off automatically is wrong. The burner will stay warm after you use it. Just like a stove does. But it DOES shut off. I leave mine plugged in all day everday. Only an idiot would leave a bottle on the warmer for more than 15 minutes anyway. What the heck are you heating it for, if you are not going to use it? Sheesh.<br /><br />Get this one. It is inexpensive and it works. Bottom line.
this is one awesome toy at an awesome price.its a great alternative to the $40 bar you have to buy seperately for the bjourn babysitter balance.as you know by now,it fits on almost any seat.i use mine on her swing,toddler chair,carseat and bjourn.its flexible so that it can be adjusted to sit wider or higher.it can be adjusted to tilt forward or back.this is due to the ball joints.it seems durable and is secure.my baby loves it.  that said,the toys could be better quality.they are lightweight and have crinkle paper inside that babies love.the vecro is a joke.a baby will rip them off with less than moderate force.the ball for the fan is the only toy that is fixed.  they should have used heavy duty velcro and more of it.  the good thing is the toys can be replaced with ones you already have.it has loops.  id definately buy again and highly recommend.
I have been using these since my now 3yr old was born. They last a long time and don't get all gross like some other brands from daily use. If you get water inside them, they will squeak when baby sucks it and get gross. So I always dip the nipple in water then wipe it clean. Also you will need to clean around the base of the nipple part where it attaches to the hard plastic. There can be buildup of milk, formula, food, etc. you will want to clean out. Again, just dip the nipple part under hot water then use your fingernail or a towel to wipe the buildup away from the base. DO NOT SUBMERGE - or it will squeak when baby uses it (which kept mine awake bc of the noise it made) and grow all kind of nasty mold inside the nipple. Just dip it into hot water. I would check about using the microwave bag for sterilizing - not sure if these are rated for that.
i haven't given this to my daughter yet because it is for her 5th birthday next month but i tried it out. it casts so many stars onto the ceiling. it actually surprised me that it covered the whole ceiling of my bedroom (my bedroom is pretty big). i guess i just imagined it would project enough to cover a small section of the ceiling. my 2 year old son was in the room when i tested it out and he was amazed by all the stars as well. he was mad when i had to put it away. guess he's getting a turtle version of this for christmas. the ladybug is also adorable. i saw that some of the customer pictures featured one with closed eyes but in the main picture her eyes were open. mine arrived with her eyes open and i was pretty pleased about that. i think she's cuter that way. anyway, i think my daughter is going to love it. if not, i'm giving it to my son. :)
I know I know, kids with teeth shouldn't have binkies... but if your kid does and you are worried about binkies becoming a choking hazard I have found that these ones do not break like the silicone ones do. I suppose any latex one would work but with my son and with my eight years working in childcare I have found that most kids really take to these throwback pacifiers. Plus the retro look is sort of in right? ;)<br /><br />On a side note there is a newer model of these that stink. The nipple is smaller and they get stuck when the air is squeezed out. The ones in the picture are the ones that stink. But when I ordered these I received the older ones (not pictured) which are amazing. The older ones look the same except for the they have a ring of the nipple around the plug where the handle is where these ones just have that flat yellow plastic piece.
my husband is the one who found this and i'm very happy that he did.  we were looking for a brush to help loosen my son's cradle cap but everything in the stores was very stiff.  i wanted something soft like the one that was used on me (if only i still had it!). this is the softest baby brush we could find and i love the wooden handle.  my baby is 6 mos old now with a good amount of hair and we still use it on him.  he seems to be happy with it too.  the only thing is it will straighten curly (caucasian) hair but i use cerave on his scalp to help with dry skin and that curls his hair without making it greasy.  i look forward to saving this brush and passing it on.  i'm even considering buying 2 more for my 5yr old & 7 yr old just so they can each have one.  (i'm optimistic that all 3 of my kids will have babies some day but it's okay if they don't.)
i did the research thru word of mouth and consumer reports, i must admit i did fall for the negative review from consumers and purchased another car seat.  i purchased the cosco alpha omega convertible. let me tell you after three hours of trying to install it into my suv, i gave up and returned it.  the seat would slide from side and side after it was properly installed.  i purchased the marathon and after three minutes the car seat was installed.  the seat would not budge.  the latch system is easy to us and since it has individual tension releases on each side it makes it very easy to operate. the car seat is costly but its worth it from an installation and safety perspective.  there are web sites that offer the marathon at a discounted rate [...]  also in nj buy buy baby is offering 10% coupons.  buy this and you will not be disappointed.  <br />
love, love, love this diaper pail. i have used other in the past and found this one to be better in a few ways. first, it does not smell! i'm not sure if that's because of the arm & hammer baking soda that is released from the top of the pail when you add a new dirty diaper or the self sealing lid that twist the bag closed when the pail is not in use. it's amazing, no smell!<br /><br />i also love the face that the bags are huge and can hold up to 2 weeks of diapers. they are so easy to get in and out of the front of the pail and each individual bag snaps and seals at the top. the bags are really strong so you don't have to worry about them tearing as you carry them out to the trashcan!<br /><br />the only thing that would make this pail better would be a foot peddle so that i can quickly ditch the dirty diaper while carrying my baby out of the room.
very good quality and secure baby seat. i found it to be one of the most confortable seats on the market and by far amount beautiful and simple. my only problem with this prodcut was amazon package handling and shippment, i bought it overseas and payed 1/3 of the price only for shipping it. first issue was the color availability, on the site there were plenty of options but only one could be shipped to my country. second issue was the package, i received it on time but totally wet with the box melting down due to exposition to water. gladly, inside the melted packaged the seat was intact besides the bad smelling (due water). i just cleaned everything very well, put it to dry and nice, my babe loves his new seat.<br /><br />i do recommend this seat, i saw one of these keep a baby alive in a very odd car accident before. it is very very safe and strong.
i have two children, ages 2 and 4, and another on the way, so we needed a way to fit all three kids safely in the back seat of my 2005 toyota camry. after a lot of research, the diono radian kept coming up as the best space-saving car seat out there. i originally just bought one to use for my 2-year-old daughter since her 4-year-old brother was already in a booster seat (using the car's seat belt). after installing our graco infant seat behind the passenger seat, putting the diono in the middle, and having the booster behind the driver, i soon realized trying to buckle the car seat belt for my son was going to be a nightmare every time we got in and out of the car. i came back and purchased a second diono radian for him and replaced his booster seat. all three seats now fit great in the back seat using the car seat belt installation method (not latch).
this product is a life saver. our little girl had trouble settling down to sleep she would either cry herself to sleep or have to sleep on moms breast.<br />she also was a colic baby and the the dr. recommended this product she said and i agree that it is good to keep her at an angle. also that it is like a hammock and keeps the baby wrapped tight. so if you swaddle her with a blanket and then put her in it keeps her nice and snuggled. it really worked and she has slept in it ever since. first in our room then moved to her own room for our peace and quiet. the only negative is that she didn't like the vibration but that may be just her. also with a newborn i removed the rattle and wish i could remove the straps. the baby is in there nice and tight it wasn't really necessary to strap them in. also the rocking is very helpful and it is very easy to rock.
Love love love love. There aren't enough words to express how much my 18 month old loves her 'puppies' as she calls them. We'e had to be about  6 since she's constantly hiding them or throwing them in the trash (not because she doesn't like them, just because she's only just discovered the trash). it's just a marvelous invention and my daughter goes to sleep immediately as long as she ha a couple of 'puppies' in her crib.<br /><br />We are great believers in pacifiers. (As is, since 2010, the American Association of Pediatricians). I know they're not for everyone, but taking our five year old's away when she was 2 was no problem at all - and some studies have shown they help prevent SIDS. Whatever you think about the pacifier itself, this is just a genius invention which gives my little girl all the comfort she needs to go to sleep soundly. (Thank God!)
Hey everyone has their problems and our just happens to be that we still use a binky to calm ourselves. The MAM works for adults so well -it's got to work great for kids too right? WELL not so fast, our screaming, burping, puking baby won't take a MAM so we're stuck with the hospital SOOTHIE binky ... until we found this one. He will take this one and helps SO much with the screaming. In fact, it has worked so well I don't have a screaming problem any more. Now I'm left to search out products that will help with the burping and puking.<br />My only con with this binky is that if you tether it to the baby the only place to do so is by the holes in the front of the binky. These can touch the cheeks of my little on an during vigorous binky sessions it can cause irritation. The binky's that I use have a pull ring so I don't have to worry about this problem.
My daughter loved her newborn soothie, but after reading about the dangers of babies choking on them (the material is flimsy enough to bend them in half and shove in a mouth) I didn't want her to have the newborn one anymore.  She was four or five months when we switched and she did NOT like these.  They are more firm and heavier. They would fall out of her mouth and she refused to use them.  I looked everywhere online to find out if most infants have a  hard the adjusting to them and couldn't find any info.  Just wanted to come back and say it took two or three days of using the new ones but she completely adjusted and loves these 3month+ soothies.  I feel better knowing that she is safe with them.  Also they are sturdy enough to teethe on. Hopefully this will give others some hope that even if your child hates them at first, they can grow to love them.
i decided i needed a bag so we could check our our stroller when flying.  we have a maclaren quest.  maclaren sells their own bag for a bit more money, so i decided to try this.  it worked perfectly.  we have used it for both domestic and international travel and it has held up well so far.  the quest fits in it with room to spare, so we are even able to throw toys and shoes in there to reduce some of the weight in our other bags - baby items like strollers and playpens don't count against you as pieces of baggage; defintely helpful in these days of airlines charging for extra bags!  ;-)<br /><br />we haven't taken it through security with us so i can't comment on how easy or not easy it is to maneuver (we generally have our car seat with us and just roll our son through the airport in that, so we don't need the stroller until we get to our destination).
some people have complained that the crib came with scratches - ours looked great! haven't used it yet so i will come back to edit when the time comes. a couple of pointers that other people may find useful:<br /><br />1) doesn't rock with the wheels on. the wheels just pop in and out pretty easily with a good tug, so it's not terrible, but either you're mobile or rocking.<br /><br />2)the mattress height is adjustable but you do have to use the little allen wrench they give you. pretty straightforward but not a click in/out thing like some cribs<br /><br />3)something to consider -- go ahead and order a new mattress when you order the crib. the one inch foam pad that came wiht it will be our  dog's new bed :) but keep in mind the taller the mattress, the &#34;shorter&#34; the crib rails get. i got a 3&#34; rather than 5&#34; deep mattress for that reason.
We bought THREE video monitors before this one and all they did was make that lovely white noise fuzz sound because they clashed with our wireless music system. This one at 900mz is so quiet you don't know its on until the baby makes a sound. But the volume doesn't go down very quietly and then its just silent or off. So we did put a little tape over the speaker in the back just because we have it RIGHT on our bedside table in my ear. :)    the video is GREAT clarity in light (color) or dark (black and white) rooms! LOVE LOVE LOVE IT! Also, there is a A and B channel so if you have two you want to keep track of you can switch to the other channel (after purchasing another camera of course).     Overall we love it and definitely say its a must have! I also like that the video can be turned off and just the sound left on if you keep it in your room at night.
our orbit baby is fantastic!  we had decided on this system before seeing the price (probably a bad idea) - but we don't regret it.<br /><br />our daughter is 4 months old now and really enjoys the stroller seat, hence our need for the large weather pack (we already had the small weather pack for the infant car seat- we keep it in the car so we're always prepared while we're out).  the rain cover is thick and substantial but doesn't smell like cheap plastic like most of the other covers i've seen other people use.  both the rain cover and bug shield are easy to put on and fit like a glove.  and they each have features that make it easy to dock/un-dock the seat from the base without removing them.<br /><br />we've used the small weather pack for the past 4 months on a daily basis and usually twice a day; both the rain cover and bug shield are holding up well.
this monitor is definitly the best purchase we made! being a first time parents we were constantly worried about everything! especially when our baby was asleep. yeah, we tried sleeping in the same room for a while, but around 3 months she started waking up every time we moved. so we purchased the monitor and set it up right on the side of the crib, so that we could see her face. you can hear every breath she takes and the video quality is great: when the lights are off, you can see as good as if it was daytime. we live in an appartment building, but there is hardly ever any interference. the baby is now 1 and half and we moved the camera in the corner of the room, so that you could see the whole crib. i can see her playing and it is so much fun watching her talk to her toys and laugh all by herself. i would recommend this product for every parent out there.
I ordered the Jasmine Giraffe first and since my daughter loved it so much I ordered the Ella Bella Elephant as well. I think these are such cute little comfort objects for a baby! My daughter is six months old and was starting to have a harder time going to sleep so we thought a comfort object might help bedtime go a little more smoothly. She absolutely loves her wubbanubs! She plays with them, cuddles with them, uses the attached pacifier (which surprised me because she rejected a couple other pacifiers we had tried) and holds one while she sleeps. She also figured out how to use it really quickly and will pick it up and put the pacifier in her mouth on her own. I also love the size, perfect for little baby hands to grasp, not too heavy for the pacifier, and doesn't add bulk to the diaper bag for on the go. This has been one of our most worthwhile baby buys!
i bought this for my son when he was about 2 years old so he could sit at the big table with everyone else.  very easy to put together (took about 30 minutes or less) - my son actually helped me do it one morning together.  the chair now has anti-tip plastic pieces that go on the back on the legs on the bottom.  we use it on tile floor and if he pushes the chair back from the table - it definitely will not tip.  he loves being at the table with everyone and having his own chair.<br />the only complaint is that the straps are not super easy to adjust and not easily (or may not be at all) removable from the chair in order to wash if things get spilled on them.  other than that i love the chair and would purchase again and again.<br />we've had the chair for about 4 months now - the finish on the walnut chair holds up great.  it is a very very nice quality chair.
My husband and I received these pacifiers in orange while in the hospital after the birth of our daughter.  We had, as new parents, gone out an bought what we thought were great pacifiers (Tommee Tippee).  We quickly learned that what you think you will like vs. what you actually use is sometimes quite different.  I'm not sure if it was because she was born small, (roughly 5.5 lbs,) or because she just likes the feel, but our daughter refuses the TT pacis and instead prefers these alone. The nipple is more similar to a breast, and to a baby who is exclusively breastfed, I would imagine that it is more soothing. We ended up buying more of the Hawaii Medical Gumdrops because they are awesome.  They have a great one-piece design and a little handle that allows you to manipulate the pacifier in you little one's mouth.  I would highly recommend these to any parent.
I was at my wits end with my daughter. She was using me as a pacifier for her naps and not letting me get anything done. I kept trying to get her to take a pacifier but she would just spit them all out and cry. I tried the one from the hospital, MAMs, Nubi, even the cheap ones from the dollar store鈥othing. Then I found these in one of my shopping bags (I didn't buy it nor did I even put it in my cart). She was only a little less than 2 months and I thought these might be too big for her mouth since it says 3+ months, but they weren't. She took to it immediately and loves them. Now I can actually lay her down for a nap without her waking up.<br />As a plus, the piece that sticks out in the back is squishy and I kind of like chewing on it while I feed her and my hands are full. However the whole for you to attach a clip or binky buddy is small so some won't fit.
i ordered this product i believe it was on a saturday and received within days of my order! i was super impressed!  i love having the added securtiy of watching my (almost 1 year old) son when i can not be in the same room as he is.  our kitchen is off to the side so if i am making his meals or washing dishes, i couldn't see or hear him (if water was running).  now i feel so at ease if i have to step out of the room.  i have noticed that it really does interferre with my wireless internet but if i move it out of the way of the wireless &#34;range&#34;, it doesn't bother it and i will take the interenet compatibility issues knowing i can see that my son is safe.  i love that this specific camera very rarely gives a fuzzy picture and during the day or when there is light in the background, everything is in color!  i love this product and am very satisfied with it!!
i am a mother of two. used these with my daughter who was only breast feeding up to the age of 4 months and had no trouble switching her to these. my son was breast feeding and using the bottle from day one. switching back and forth. i bought a nuk bottle since it was what he was used to in the hospital but he kept chocking on it. them i switched to these again and no problem back and forth with breast and bottles.<br />these are the only ones that are designed like the breast and have no weird shapes all the other bottles have that shoot up the milk on the top of the baby's mouth (very unlike the breast). i also bought the anti-colic ones in the beginning but i really don't think bottles, drops or any old thing can improve colics. i found they where not worth the trouble. im in love with these bottles. i always recommend them to all my friends who are expecting.
bought this before my first baby was born, based on reviews and ended up loving it! it's a smooth ride for both baby and i, and definitely can handle a lot.  it's very easy to fold up but can get quite heavy constantly putting it into the trunk of your car and taking it out. i use this not only for walking/jogging but also at malls, parks, etc. i can fit quite a bit into this except for my diaper bag which can become annoying b/c the bottom storage is so small.  however, i just take out the essentials from the diaper bag and place them into the back pockets of the stroller.  reclines almost flat for baby to sleep, canopy has great coverage and good size window, amazing brakes and hand brakes, etc.    my only complaint would be the weight (which is expected i suppose) and the lack of space for a diaper bag, a small diaper bag.    otherwise, perfect for our family.
a boppy pillow is an absolute must for a nursing mother. i had one with my son, and knew that it was the one thing i would need for my new baby.  i probably got more use out of the boppy pillow than any other baby item (besides diapers!) it's perfect for baby to lie on while you're nursing, or even for baby to sleep on mom or dad's lap. it saves your back by keeping baby up a little higher than your legs, so you don't have to hunch over. it's also great to lay baby on the floor, since it props them up a little bit, but not too much.  the cover on this one is super-soft, and is even removable for washing, which helps a lot. the price is great, considering that a bare boppy pillow is typically thirty-five dollars, and each cover is at least twenty (not including the soft cozy ones, which are a little more). overall great to have, i highly recommend it for a new baby.
We had the old Haba pacifier chains (the ones that detach in the middle) and was surprised by the short length of this one; but we found out that this is the new standard length.  Our son uses the Mam pacifiers, the ones without the little ring. A good way to attach them to the chain is to remove the silicone ring that comes with the Mam holder (usually comes free with the pacifiers) and put it on this one.  So, all the pacifiers can be easily attached / removed.  However, with the european style pacifiers (the ones with the ring attached) this holder takes 30 sec. longer to attach. To get the pacifier off, it's a different story, and depends on how wet the little cord gets!   We've had it for a couple of months, and the cotton cord is surprisingly sturdy and shows no wear!  The clip is slightly loose since our son realized that he can detach it just by yanking it.
So far this video monitoring system has performed above my expectations.  After reading some of the other reviews I was worried.  Yes, the movement alarm will sound every other second when you first turn it on.. there's a dial on the camera labelled sensitivity that needs to be adjusted properly (or disabled) before you use the system.  The only thing that surprised me, but in retrospect shouldn't have, was that in order to use Skype you have to have the video monitor attached to a PC.  I didn't read that anywhere before purchasing, but it makes sense.  It's pretty cool that the monitor acts as a wireless video camera for chatting.  It shows up as a normal webcam.  The temperature does read as warmer than it should, but this can be taken into consideration when setting temperature-based alarms.  For me it's not anywhere near the 10 degrees off that others reported.
amazon doess a terrible job with the pictures and description on this.<br />we bought an older version of this car seat -to-stroller airport accessory over 5 years ago with our first for flights after struggling through airports on our first trip as parents. it has been a lifesaver from day 1! we've now taken it through about 20 airports about 50 times, with kids from 8 to 40 pounds, all with a britax roundabout car seat. still drives easily. still opens and closes easily. it has been years since we found a security gate that it didnt fit through, and if we'd had the quick release wheels then it would have been a non issue. we even have belted it in on the plane attached to the car seat as is. we see many more cumbersome baby transport options at the airport, but never one easier. even my spendthrift husband reported that it paid for itself the first time we used it.
we have a 50' samsung tv that we just purchased and we feel much better with the anti-tip straps connected to the top of the back and the back edge of the tv stand. you want the straps to go straight down to the back edge of the stand, not at an angle to the right or left. when you are sitting in front of the tv, you don't notice the straps as they are pure black. the straps when tightened have no flexibility, so they create a very secure environment. incidentally, i don't recommend connecting them to the wall for two reasons, 1) if the tv stand gets bumped, it can cause the straps to be pulled, and 2) if you want to gently move the stand to clean or work on the wiring in the back, the straps would need to be disconnected from their wall anchors, leaving you without their intended support. and this system is good to have when there are youngsters and oldsters around.
Of all the millions of baby things I got and bought for my child, this Wubbanub was among the most-used and best-quality items that I simply couldn't live without. The stuffed animal helps anchor the pacifier in the mouth. This was particularly helpful when she got to the age where she threw everything on the floor, where it would promptly disappear with the dust bunnies under the couch.<br /><br />She held onto the giraffe every night and it comforted her while she fell asleep and she played with it during the day. It was a lifesaver.<br /><br />Some reviewers have complained the pacifier doesn't detach, but this was a plus for me. If it had, I would have probably lost the pacifier or the animal and they would have never been conjoined again. The whole thing is washable or you can simply wipe down the pacifier part. I now buy a Wubbanub for every baby shower I go to.
this is easy enough to put together (just need a phillips screwdriver) and the instructions are decent enough to follow.<br /><br />the noises it makes when rocking aren't all that loud on ours (maybe they made an improvement over the model they shipped with the ones other reviewers purchased?). the different music options range from &#34;sugar-high play time&#34; to &#34;sleepy snooze time&#34; and then the &#34;i'm lost in the woods and hope a witch doesn't eat me&#34; nature option, but without the weird vibe you'd get from really being lost in the woods and thinking witches are real. the variable rocking speed is also nice, though the high setting could be dangerous if the kid weren't strapped in (my wife says we're just preparing them to be astronauts).<br /><br />we haven't had any issues with it and are happy with our purchase. we also do no believe in witches.
When our daughter was under 2 months, she was FUSSY and we were willing to try ANYthing to get her and keep her asleep. Friends recommended a pacifier, but she was so little (6 pounds at birth), she couldn't keep a pacifier in her mouth, and if she lost it, that only made her 1000 times fussier. And then we found the wubbanub. Even when she was very young, she could hold onto this pacifier. She loves the pattern, and she enjoys chewing on all parts of it. It's also easy to find, and hard to lose - a winning combo. There's something extra special about the giraffe. We have a little duck wubbanub too, but the horns on the giraffe and the weight of the feet just make it perfect somehow....Whoever invented these is genius. Also, if you are concerned, the wubbanub is light enough that a baby can easily move it, so you don't have to worry about a suffocating/choking hazard.
I purchased I don't know how many pacifiers without success. I received my first MAM in a promotional gift bag and then a friend with a two-year-old sent me a gift of her favorite baby things which also included my second pacifier. This is the only brand that my baby has used since birth, he spits the other pacifiers out after seconds.<br />As time goes on it's important to strategically place pacifiers throughout the house so I went on Amazon to purchase a few. These are slightly more expensive than the price Target offers, but with a newborn you don't really want to go to the store over and over again so Amazon Prime delivers much in 1 to 2 days. Of Course in my sleep deprived blur, I've misplaced them repeatedly so I recommend getting the clip<br />In addition to MAM's design, they make the cleaning easier where the sanitation in the packaging has been useful as well.
these washcloths were purchased for adult use.  i was originally looking for a 100% cotton washcloth to replace some worn ones i have.  after reading some of the reviews, i decided to order a pack of the brooklyn bamboo baby washcloths.  when i received the shipment, unfortunately i had a rough place on my finger that snagged and pulled the threads on one of the washcloths.  i went ahead and placed all of the washcloths in the washer and dryer so that my husband and i could use them that night.  when i took them out of the dryer, the snagged place was not even noticeable.  the washcloths were very soft.  i was able to soap up the washcloth for my shower without having to continue re-soaping the washcloth as i had previously had to do with the old washcloths.  this turned out to be a side benefit for saving soap. my husband and i are both very satisfied with the purchase.
This pacifier was definitely one of my best finds while registering for gifts.  It's our go-to car seat pacifier.  It sits on her chest well, making it easier for her to recover after spitting it out accidentally and making it less likely to fall on the floor.  The elephant gives me something to easily grab from the drivers seat while reaching back as she cries on her way home from daycare.  Suprisingly, it also helped in her development of learning how to reach/grab and becoming more coordinated.  She's now four months old and still loves this Soothie pacifier, although she also uses MAM pacifiers in the house.  I held out for a couple months, but just gave in and purchased another WubbaNub last week.<br /><br />It would be wonderful if the pacifier could be separated from the animal for easier cleaning, but this doesn't deter me from recommending it to all of my friends.
the bright starts 3-in-1 roaring fun lion is a great toy for babies through toddler-age kids.  its strength is its versatility, permitting play by sitting in front of it, pushing it from behind, or sitting/riding on it.  it also adjusts very simply between the three modes due to the solid fit and construction of the whole unit.<br /><br />babies can press the lion's nose to trigger music and sound effects while the included ping-pong balls spin around its face.  they can also &#34;feed&#34; it the balls and then watch them come out below for some cause-and-effect play.  older kids can push or ride on it and watch the balls spin around as they do so.<br /><br />overall, the 3-in-1 roaring fun lion provides a variety of play modes in one package while also ensuring that it will get use as your baby grows into his/her toddler years.  it's a lot of fun that's also a good value.
I have a 7-week old baby that loves to suck and soothe with the a pacifier. We have an assortment at our house in a variety of brands and styles.  I really like these pacifiers.  It fits in her mouth perfect and of all the pacifier types we have she does seem to prefer this style the best.  She will take any of the pacifiers, but she has less trouble immediately sucking on the phillips agent ones than the more standard pacifiers.  We bought the yellow ones, since we didn't know the sex of our baby prior to arrival and they are great.  They are easy to spot when she loses them in her car seat or swing.  Also, it is kind of funny to watch her suck it since you can see through the bottom.  Other moms have told me their babies have gotten their thumb stuck in the bottom, but that has yet to happen to us and I don't anticipate any issues.  I would definitely buy this product again.
We ordered these after my 8-1/2 month old son decided to play a not-so-fun game called &#34;throw the pacifier down a drainage pipe.&#34;<br /><br />He thought it was funny; mom and I not so much. Especially considering we did not have a &#34;backup&#34; of the exact type.<br /><br />We ordered these hoping they would be similar to the ones he was use to, but as you likely already know, sometimes little ones can be particular about what they like/dislike. While these were delivered quickly and were exactly as listed, our son will not take these. I would highly recommend these to anyone who is already familiar with NUK pacifiers. If you're not sure if your little one will like these, try purchasing a 2-pack prior to shelling out the money for all 8.<br /><br />And if he or she likes them, then order these in case your little one also plays the &#34;throw the pacifier&#34; game.
I am weaning my 10-month-old and these are the only bottles she will accept. They are easy for her to hold as the bottom is larger and textured (which prevents her hands from sliding down). The nipple has a tapered shape and soft texture, which has has really helped with the transition. Not to mention EASY to clean- wide enough to wash by hand. We have had success with warming the bottle and replacing one feeding at a time. Also using the slowest flow nipple that comes with this set. After a week she is now holding the bottle herself and drinking it happily! There's been no issues switching between bottles during the day and breast at night!<br /><br />As a sidenote, the mam pacifiers are amazing as well. The texture is soft like skin, not slick like other pacifiers. They were my first daughters favorite, and MY favorite because other kinds blocked her nostrils (she was tiny).
My daughter got the Soothie binky in the hospital and would only take that kind thereafter. The Soothie blocks their nose and it doesn't seem to stay in their mouth very well because it isn't contoured to their face. I found this Gumdrop one on Amazon and she switched over right away, no problems. I think it stays in better and makes breathing easier (or maybe it just makes me breathe easier not seeing her little nose blocked). It also has a hole for a binky holder, which is great. Another good point is that it is all one piece for safety, and I don't know how my daughter always falls asleep with the binky wedged between her face and the bed, but with the Gumdrop it's not uncomfortable because it doesn't have the hard plastic piece. The vanilla scent is nice but it does fade after washing a few times. It's not that big of a deal for me because I didn't buy it for the scent. :)
i used this with my first born for 19 months and loved it.  i plan on using it for my newborn when the time is right. i am an attorney and in court a lot.  given my workload and busy days, this machine is a godsend.  this machine is easy to put together and use and i was able to pump 6 oz (3 from each breast) in less than 10 minutes.  i would then pump one or two times more during the day.  i think it is easy to take apart for washing and easy to put it back together, but it may take some practice for some people.  this set does not include a bustier for pumping, but you must buy a bustier separately in order for this product to be truly hands free.  i have seen comments on here that the suction is sub-par.  i disagree.  there are numerous settings to increase suction.  i use level 5, but there are higher levels with more force.  i would recommend this product and have done so.
I did get the product I ordered so I can only assume the people that didn't ordered from a different vender or got confused and ordered the wrong product. That being said, this thing IS sold as a novelty and for the reason I took that into consideration during my review. This thing is too cute, the nipple is too large for a new born but should be usable after about 6-9 months. There is no ring or ledge for removal from a baby's mouth or to attach a pacy clip to. This shouldn't be a big deal because this should probably only be used under CLOSE supervision due to the nipple size, weight and materials used. Let's face it, though it can be used by a child it doesn't look like usability was the main goal when making this. Laughter was. It's built well and will work. If your baby doesn't like the nipple on the pacy try pulling the face off of this pacy can gluing it onto another one.
I'm a new mom and I bought these because I heard that they are great for breastfeeding babies (avoiding nipple confusion, promoting good latching with the shape).  They've been wonderful! Can't beat the price, arrived well packaged, no &#34;funny plastic&#34; smell.  Loop is big enough that you can easily pick up one-handed (thank God) but not too big where it constantly hits things.  My 5 week old loves playing with the loop, working on her coordination.<br /><br />***No breastfeeding problems, baby loves them, mommy loves them.  5 stars for me!<br /><br />I don't know why everyone is so concerned with the colors.  It says colors may vary, pink and purple are colors too! I get that it's a gender-normative thing, but seriously who cares if your boy sucks a pink pacifier if he loves it, it costs less than $2 and doesn't cause breastfeeding issues? A good product is a good product.
I was a bit skeptical about this product early on in baby's life as it seemed hard for her to keep it in her mouth, not to mention she preferred the Nuk brand more. However, I became a convert around the five month mark when I started putting baby to sleep with this guy in her crib and found that she was able to find the pacifier when it fell out thanks to the critter attached. I even went so far as to buy another one because it was working so well. Even though my daughter is now almost eight months, we still use these as her 'night-time' pacifiers for the reason above. Not to mention I think she finds comfort even in holding onto the animal even if the pacifier is out of her mouth. Another idea I read about in a magazine is to cut the pacifier off when you are trying to wean baby. This still allows them to have something familiar and cozy, but the paci is gone. Food for thought!
my two kids have loved these bottles.  my poor son was the tester of many bottles before we found that these were the best.  we trialed about 3 other bottles before learning that the naturalatch was the best match for us. as a stay at home mom, i didn't use many bottles for my kids.  occasionally, i needed one for a feeding, but they were definitely both more willing to nurse from mama.  i found a site that recommended using these as a good match for a breastfed baby.  i would definitely agree.  gave these a try and have never gone back.  my 11 month old daughter has used these and the transition from breast to bottle was very easy for us both.  this was true for my son when i weaned him from breastfeeding at about 13 months of age.<br />i have enjoyed their durability and will admit that i haven't even used the clear plastic ones with the bottle.  they have always used the latex.
I have twin boys, one loves any pacifier you put in his mouth, he lives for pacifiers lol the other hates every paci ive tried. I wasnt looking for a paci for him, just my other son, this one came in 2 packs and my boys theme colors were blue and green so I was sold, lol I put this in my sons mouth who DOESNT LIKE paci's and he wouldnt stop sucking it, kept it in the whole way home and jus loves em. These are the only pacifiers ill ever buy.<br /><br />Funny story, my husbands sister had a baby who is also a picky paci baby, he only likes one with a big bubble on the end, however I gave him my paci to suck because he started to whine and he took it out, looked at it then put it back in his mouth! Til this day he has it... which sucks because it was the moon and sun with clouds version and they were beautiful shades of deep blue and deep green. Either way, this pacifier is AMAZING.
I go to da South side all da time to buy me some jewlereee my man dayday like it when I look fresh. I been puttin off buyin food for da kids to save for da dis. After all ain't school lunch free? I tell em to steal some of da lunches cuz they ain't eating at home.

Well thanks to da amazon ppl dayday and laquonda took da pacifire and left me here with da kids.  But I gots a plan I'm gonna get me a job at da Popeye and find me a man.
My son has never been a diehard binky addict like my older daughter was, but I wanted to try something a little more stylish than the tried & true Soothies we've always used. These were on a special promo & I thought why not. I'm very pleased with them so far (about a week of use). My 4 month loves to grab & he can hold on to the handle  & actually put it back in his mouth (whether intentional or not!). True, the glow in the dark feature doesn't hold for hours & hours, but that's kinda common sense. Truth be told, anything that would retain a bright glow for that long wouldn't be something I'd want to give to my infant anyway!  My son seems to like these quite well for those times when he's in need of a comfort suck & doesn't need a bottle. I like the shape of the nipple & how it's proportionate for his size/age. I'd recommend these.   *Amazon sent me the yellow which is very cute.
My son has loved his Soothies since the day he was born but always had trouble keeping them in his mouth; dropping them and such.  I bought a Soothie Pacifier holder (the honey pot one) but that item failed us.  Soon after I ordered this Wubbanub (my son's first nick name was 'Monkey') at 3 months and even at 6 months old, he LOVES it and uses it as 'security blanket', if you will.  He plays with it and it's very easy for him to hold on to and put in his mouth on his own.  He also gets TONS of compliments on it! It's good to the both of us.  I definitely suggest this product to all mamas!<br /><br />EDIT: My son is now nearly 2 years old. We weened him off this pacifier (THE ONLY ONE HE WOULD USE) at about 12 months by cutting the Soothie out of the Monkey mouth and sewing the mouth shut. He was so over his paci after only 2 nights and now, he and the monkey are inseparable at bed time.
highly recommended especially if you are breastfeeding. there is much needed fat in the breastmilk that your baby needs. (such as to develop the myelin sheaths in their brain which is composed of fat). with the glass bottles, the fat residue slides right off the glass with the rest of the milk. however, with a plastic bottle, a film of the fat remains on the bottle.<br /><br />also, when warming up the bottle, it is much faster because the glass heats up quicker than plastic. the bottles are easy to hold, and are not very heavy. there is a warning on the bottle of possible breakage if the bottle is placed in quickly changing temperatures: but that's only if it was extreme like going from a frozen bottle and then placing it in hot water. i have not had any glass breakage when i take the cold bottle out of the refrigerator and heat it up in a container holding already microwaved hot water.
anyone who has an infant is very aware that traveling light is impossible.  however, some things become invaluable.  i highly recommend this bottle brush and drying rack.  it is totally self contained, and so handy.  the brush is long enough to get into 8 ounce bottles easily, but not so long as to be unwieldy.  it does a great job quickly getting milk residue out of all types of bottles,  i also love the self contained drying rack.  it's a clean surface to let the recently cleaned bottles dry on.<br /><br />we unfortunately travel with a lot of stuff, but we have added this as a must have item whenever we will be gone long enough to need to clean bottles.  it's relatively inexpensive and super handy.<br /><br />i highly recommend this set.  oxo makes great tools and gadgets and this is no exception.  this would be a fabulous gift for a new or expectant mom.<br /><br />highly recommended!
i used bibbity bibs at every feeding until my daughter was two. the catch pocket does a nice job, and the neck opening has three different slots to fit a range of sizes. the bibs went through the dishwasher with no signs of wear, and they roll up nicely for travel. the pocket also serves as a bowl for cheerios and other finger foods; a flight attendant saw my daughter eating cheerios from her bib pocket and declared she was going to buy a bibbity for her grandson. i only stopped using these bibs because they are now too short to cover my daughter's shirt. (this isn't really a design flaw. had they been longer, the catch pocket would have been below the high chair tray when my daughter was younger.)<br />for comparison, i also purchased the bjorn bib and an ikea pocket bib. the hard plastic on those was uncomfortable around my daughter's neck and did not sit well against the high chair tray.
If there were more stars to give I would!  The caterpillar was the first wubbie she had.  We got great use out of it.  My daughter was able to maneuver the pacifier and put in her mouth once falling out at a month or at least a little after one month old.  It's easy to spot if it happens to fall so losing it was pretty slim.  Once we started seeing the fabric starting to wear thin (this was after a year or so use) we replaced it...well that and because my husband and I are 眉ber nostalgic we decided to replace the caterpillar with a new one so that we could keep her first and put it in her memory chest.<br /><br />We receive many compliments and questions as to where to purchase them.  I like to use them as part of a congrats on finding out your expecting/baby shower/new baby gifts because they aren't so mainstream so I find its a gift that stands out...parents love them...babies love them...
this product works great and is very nice to look at. it is so much better than my previous \\paper towels all over the counter\\ drying method. this is the type of product most of us first time moms don't register for because we have no idea how much stuff there will be to wash after baby arrives! it has a very unique look to it, but the \\grass\\ is also very functional. it helps keep everything upright so that things dry faster and allows excess water to drip down to the tray below. the size is perfect for the area next to my sink. i live in an apartment and have a smaller kitchen so i would not want anything larger taking up a huge amount of counter space. despite it being compact, it can handle several bottles, all of my breast pump parts, nipple shields, and baby teethers. i am very happy with this product. i recently purchased the flower extension to add a little bit more surface area.
this product is a must-buy! i originally recieved this as a gift when pregnant with my son...he is now 14 months old and has a little sis on the way and still loves watching and playing with this mobile!     there are two volume settings for the tunes which are perfectly set. of the two volume settings one is set to be fairly quiet for nighttime and napping and then there is the higher setting for playtime. the animals are very vibrant in color and the moving leaves are adorable. there is also a night light setting as well. you also have the option of 3 sets of tunes or rainforest nature noises. this is truly a wonderful item that i recommend for everyone whether it matches the theme of the room or not. my son absolutely loved watching all of the moving animals and leaves...i would joke that he thought going to bed was playtime because he would get so excited to see his mobile. excellent item!
First off, these will only glow if you expose them to light for a while first. Same as any other glow in the dark product. I love the mam pacifiers because my son showed strong favor to them when he was only a month old. Do yourself a favor and don't bother with novelty pacifiers with mustaches and funny sayings. These fit perfectly in baby's mouth no matter how which direction it goes in. Once the baby learns how to put their pacifier in their mouths, it's easy for them to do and since they glow in the dark, it's easy to find in the crib at night. I'm not a fan of the clear ones because they're hard for him to find. To the reviewer who said the pacifiers make her baby drool, that's like saying a specific diaper makes your baby poop. Babies drool. It's a fact of life. Get over it. Also, do yourself a favor and purchase the mam pacifier clips. They're the only ones that work with mam pacifiers.
as first time parents, we were given the choice to use a pacifier in the hospital. after much debate b/c of breastfeeeding, we decided to let our son have it b/c our son was just very inconsolable while my milk came in. nothing worked to soothe him not shooshing, not swaddling, not anything and not even the hospital nurses could soothe him.  this was a godsend! it did not contribute to any breastfeeding problems and has been the best thing to calm our son.  he is now 3 months old and only wants it when is very stressed so he is not dependent upon it all the time, did not have nipple confusion and had learned to self soothe for the most part now by sucking his fingers.  it is really a great product and i recommend it to anyone wanting to use a pacifier for their baby. our son refuses to use any other brand or type but the soothie for the sucking action is calming to him like when he is feeding.
mam is the only bottle I use for my kids. it is amazing for nursing moms.. all my kids transitioned from nursing to bottles and with MAM bottles it seems a smooth one. After my second child i also discovered that you can sterilize the bottles without the annoying bulky microwave sterilizers! you simply take the bottom apart and add some water and then pop it in the microwave for a minute or so... amazing! the only semi-annoying part is that sometimes if you don't put the bottom back properly it leaks... but by the third child, I just wash them in the dishwasher and don't even bother to take it a part (the dishwasher is great since it cleans the bottom very well without any mildew or anything...). My kids also love MAM pacifiers and always look at me if I try to give them a different brand as if &#34;what are you giving me? this is not the one i like!&#34;... great products altogether. BIG FAN!
I bought this for our baby grandson. It is really soft and plush feeling. The sound it makes sounds exactly like an ultrasound of mom's tummy. It has a velcro strap that you can put on the crib, to lull the baby to sleep. Once the baby is older, you can remove the part that makes the noise and use it as bear to sleep with. It looked safe enough to me to let a small child play with. I checked the eyes on the bear and they felt very secure. I thought it was a great value because I wanted my grandson to have a teddy bear and also something that would help him go to sleep.I am a bear collector, so I am picky about the bears I like to buy. This looked more like the old fashioned looking teddy bears because I don't like the bears that have noses the size of a pig's snout. It comes really secured in its packaging and was in perfect shape on arrival. I thought it was an excellent choice for the price.
Recently bought a second bag. No worries, the first one is still going strong - our family has grown and we needed another bag and based on our experience with this car seat travel bag, we did not even hesitate buying one more.   First of all, the material is much thicker and stronger than I originally expected. It holds up well and is easy to wipe clean. The straps are nice and strong, and my husband swears they are comfortable too - he does most of the hauling. It sits well on your back (just the right spot) on an average height person but even a petite woman like me can't complain and I'm barely 5 feet tall.   We were trying to choose between a bag with straps vs. bag with wheels and are really glad we went with straps. We don't use backpacks when travelling so it is very convenient to throw this on your back so your hands are free to pull suitcases, push a stroller or carry a cranky toddler!
this product deserves a thousand stars! i can't even find words to describe my gratitude for it. if you have a difficult baby, you must get this swing! after half a day or night of consoling my baby, my back is too aching to keep holding her. i would feel desperate if it weren't for knowing that i can always put her in this swing and she will relax and go to sleep. it has saved our lives! not all babies need so much consoling, but if your baby happens to be colicky, this swing will become your most precious possession. it is of very nice quality- well constructed and safe, with comfortable soft lining. and it works really well. i don't have a single complaint about it. also, the sounds console baby if the swinging alone doesn't work. and if swinging side to side doesn't work, then often swinging front to back will relax baby. it's amazing. i can't imagine how anyone would survive colic without it.
My son loved his WubbaNub pacifier and so did I!  After a short time, he was able to place this pacifier in his mouth ON HIS OWN!  I can't express in words how happy THAT made me!<br /><br />This frog is the perfect size...not too big, but not too small either.  Washing was a breeze - I just stuck it in the washing machine with his clothes and would let it air dry.<br /><br />Another bonus, around 1 year of age, HE decided to stop using it on his own.  I'm so glad that I didn't have to go through that battle with him!  I think that kids generally don't want large items hanging out of their mouth by that age...so rather than have the trouble of getting rid of a pacifier at 2+, he has learned to self soothe without one.<br /><br />Thanks WubbaNub for making a quality product that we all enjoy! As a side note, these pacifiers are simply cute...so they quickly become a lovable part of your daily routine.
I would definitely recommend these my son really liked these pacifiers. I don't think most people understand difference between these and something from 99 cent store. The fact is that babies feel comfortable when eating or breast feeding and using a pacifier replicates that warmth and comfort. They cant move on their own or use toys so this provides comfort and entertainment. but the bigger issue is sucking creates pressure that can damage structure of babies mouth causing crocked teeth or cross bites. So these are worth the money and that is why after a certain age you have to stop toddler from pacifier habit when they can use other toys and objects for comfort. This pacifier helps prevent dental damage from pacifier over usage. Also it states 0-6 month so after that find another pacifier size or other toys that they will enjoy. hope this is helpful if so please click the helpful link at the bottom.
Our son's name it Pete, so of course he needed a dragon pacifier. We keep two at a time on hand: one in the diaper bag in case he feels insecure when we go somewhere, or to help him fall asleep in the car seat, and the other in his bed. Sucking on the pacifier is part of his going to sleep process. These WubbaNub pacifiers are great when the baby is little because they can hold on to it and keep it in their mouth much earlier than when it's just the plain pacifier. And both our boys preferred this type of pacifier. But now our son is 18mos and it has become like a security lovie. Other than falling asleep, he doesn't need it often, but it sure makes him feel better to have this along. The dragon is unusual enough and bright enough that it's easy to find if he drops or misplaces it. When he was younger and used it all the time, everyone at the gym childcare and church nursery knew it was Pete's dragon.
i did not use this personally but it saved my wife when she was pregnant. she was regularly using 4 or 5 different pillows stuffed and tucked in various positions so that she could get to sleep. i was usually the one doing the stuffing which caused more than one argument when i couldn't get the pillows just right (no fault of mine of my wife's we were just both tired and she was trying to get comfortable for two). we would also be woken up at least once a night because of a pillow falling out of place or because my wife needed a pillow adjusted. a chiropractor specializing in pregnant mothers and infants told us to try this pillow and so we did. all the other pillows were put back in their homes. my wife was able to position this pillow by her self for the most part. it stayed in place almost every night and gave her head, belly, back, and leg support. we both slept better thanks to this great pillow.
My twins just turned two and absolutely love these pacifiers!  Be advised that around two, you may have to switch them from the greenish newborn soothie to the pink or blue harder soothies.  With two year molars coming in, the twins are starting to chew off the tops.  The newborn ones are also so flexible that your baby will eventually fit the whole thing in their mouth.  Still, I would recommend this pacifier to any parent.  My twins are obsessed with them.      A tip for parents who find their babies waking up at night due to lost binkies.  There's a snack tray holder that attaches to car seats (runs around $10).  It wouldn't work for my britex car seats, but it attaches easily to their toddler bed.  I put two extra binkies in there before bed and during the night, if my twins wake up and can't find their binky, they easily access them from the snack tray holder.  Now, I don't have to wake up at night.
had been using the gdiaper cloth insert + pants for my daughter for her first 18 months. at 18 months, she had pushed the inserts beyond capacity.<br /><br />i found this seller through my searches online and contacted her directly about buying in bulk. she was fast to respond, friendly, and courteous. a few days later 30 of these diapers were at my door. yippee!<br /><br />i have been using these inserts since june 2013 (9 months at the time of this review) for my now 2.5 year old daughter and 11 month old son. they look wonderful, smell wonderful, and have not shrunk in size at all. i also love that the dark gray color hides stains (vs. the white gdiaper cloth inserts.)<br /><br />i am also looking forward to see if these gray inserts will dry faster in the sun this summer (vs. gdiaper white inserts in previous summers.)<br /><br />you could not get me to go back to gdiaper inserts even if you paid me!
i bought this for my sister. her baby shower is in october (it's august) and her theme is owls for her expected little girl. she put a boring pink album on the list but said she only picked it because it was the only girl one at her store! i bought this one instead (and told the place to take the other off the registry for me!). it's tooooo adorable! it's got a nice shiny finish on the front and back like a library book would (only done much nicer) to protect it. the pages are great, smooth and you can certainly fit a lot of pictures into it. something i hadn't noticed until i got it was that it has a little spot for a cd/dvd at the back of the book so you can add a dvd of special moments or a cd of pictures that couldn't fit in the book (considering baby's first years are so precious you try to capture every moment on camera!). definitely worth the $18 i spent on it (and a double plus that it had prime!).
i really wish i would have picked one of these up or even been aware of this product when i was pregnant. i am in love with it. i wanted to surprise my sister with it when she comes over with it for her daughter. i set it up (very easy to do) and just waited. i grew so anxious that i called her over. as soon as she saw it -- love! she wanted to keep it but since i have nanny duties for her and her husband i wanted to keep it ... yeah, that's an issue. but what's not is how well her daughter took to it -- rocked what is sometimes a fussy little girl to dreamland. usually, the slightest little noise will just wake her and cause an ear-piercing squeal ... ah, babies ... but nothing, the soft music, rocking just kept her knocked out.<br /><br />what makes it great? well, it's not heavy, easy to move around, not too low to the floor, not a pain to put together and the light show -- whatever, i can enjoy it too.
The reason that these pacifiers are advertised as being for children WITHOUT teeth has to do with the fact that they are made of soft plastic that can be chewed through and that babies with teeth (3 months and up) can possibly chew through them and maybe swallow the pieces. The company that manufactires them makes a sturdier rubber version that cannot be bitten through, called the Super Soothie. However, i tried buying them for my daughter and she HATED them and ONLY uses the Soothie (has never taken any other pacifier.) She LOVES them. She is 2 now so she is ready to gradually wean from the pacifier altogether. And yes she has chewed a hole in one or two of them but no harm done! But thats the reason why the company states that about the teeth. they Are NOT considered bad for your child's teeth and will be comparable in that way to any other pacifier out there.    [...] Is the website of the manufacturer.
worked amazingly well -- we have only used it once, when we went to a fourth of july firework display. looks really nice. long enough to fully extend our legs and lean back (we are about 6 ft tall) and big enough that we weren't crowded. at the end of the night, picked it up, shook it off, and there wasn't anything (no grass, etc) stuck to it. i would suggest looking at how it folds during the day for your first use -- it is really easy to fold. at night without any light and trying to hurry, we didn't get it right and although we got it to close up, it didn't look great. upon getting back home we refolded -- the far end has a cardboard guide inserted inside the blanket, and you simply fold it over that and it looks like we never used it! folded it is about the size of a large purse. the carrying strap is sturdy and very convenient, but not the most comfortable if you are going to be carrying it multiple miles.
i bought two of these, one for my 4 year old son and one for my 1.5 year old daughter.  i commend myself for this purchase because both my children love their twilight turtle.  it has become a part of their bedtime routine.  not only is it educational but it is also of quality construction.  the turtle's body parts are so soft that my toddler loves running her hands over them.  and the twilight turtle is also able to withstand a great pounding because my daughter also loves to throw it around and knock on different objects with its shell.  believe it or not, it hasn't even chipped and it still functions as is expected.    well worth the money.  i highly recommend this to anyone looking for a night light which gives the child comfort; and as the child grows older and more cognizant the turtle becomes multi-functional because it is also educational.  it is fun pointing out the constellations to my 4 year old son.
one of the best things we could have purchased. the dr. brown's bottle warmer works very well and warms a room temperature bottle up in 3 minutes or so. a bottle out of the refrigerator takes about another minute or so, still very fast and much better than using the microwave in my opinion.<br /><br />one suggestion i do have is to occasionally (maybe weekly) dump the water out of the inside of the warmer and clean the inside as well as the part the reservoir goes into and the reservoir itself.<br /><br />we were not doing this initially and it got a little smelly and we had to give it a good cleaning, then rinse with water and a little vinegar then rinse a bunch more to be sure it was clean.<br /><br />obviously make certain everything is dry before plugging it back in and do not submerge it in water or overly drench it around the electronics or you will most likely damage the unit or potentially hurt yourself.
if you are expecting a baby, know someone who is or have a new grandchild due and want something at your house for those short visits, buy one of these!! this is so soft and comfy for baby. a friends baby had colic and she said it seemed to help. it is a very gentle rocking motion and also vibrates if you want. when my daughter finally got to bring her micro preemie home (she had to stay with me for a couple of months for medical reasons) i brought one of these home so we would have a place in the living room for the baby, but not down where the dogs could get in his face (like in a bouncy seat). she wasn't sure about it until it was put together and she placed her precious child in it. all smiles from everyone. it was then in the dining room, doorway to the kitchen, in the hall outside the bathroom while she did her hair.....get the picture? lol much more portable than a pack n play or bassinet. so, give it a try!
i can't imagine having lived without these as burp cloths. baby was super colicky the first three months with lots of reflux and constant spitting up (it took us a few months to isolate his dairy intolerance). i had two packs of these and wished i'd had four. i can't emphasise enough how great they are and how much i've relied on them - and continue to rely on them now that baby is a year old. i'm sure i will use them until they absolutely fall to pieces - whenever that is as they are still in great condition a year later after constant use. i'm now buying them for a friend whose just had her first baby.<br /><br />also noteworthy: when baby got a nappy rash, i used these around the house instead of our regular cloth nappies, just pinned them on both sides. this allowed him to get plenty of air without getting the carpet wet - but i had to change him as soon as he did anything. (obviously didn't use a plastic cover)
i have a number of portable diaper changing pads like this, one is a padded neoprene, and many are just simple fabric with a water repelling side.<br /><br />however, i have to say that this is the softest and most luxurious diaper changing pad i own. i have the vibrant dinosaur print, which i absolutely love, even though i'm usually a black and gray sort of person. the fabric is a very soft, sleek plush and for once i don't feel guilty laying my baby down on it. honestly, the thing is nice enough that you could use it as a little car seat blanket in a pinch. it is that soft and the fabric is that high quality.<br /><br />it did go through the washer well when we got some food smudged on it in the food released from the fabric easily. no stains.<br /><br />i received a sample of this diaper pad in exchange for my honest review. this thing is nice enough that i actually plan on purchasing a few more for my next baby.
these are wonderful. i have the bamboo ones. i had given up on reusable nursing pads after trying two other brands that didn't work well. luckily i decided to try these, because i love them. they are really soft and there's no lint sticking to my nipples. they are absorbent and have a breathable nearly waterproof backing so your bra doesn't get wet but your boobs don't feel hot and clammy. (i don't think it would be completely waterproof, but so far i've been dry. i use it to catch the letdown on the other side when i'm nursing and can use the same one all day.) they don't bunch up in the wash like the other one i tried, so it sits nice in my bra and is not noticeable under clothing (within limits--you would see them if you were really looking, or wearing an unlined nursing bra and a tight fitting, light colored t-shirt). overall i'm really happy with these. i use their cloth diapers too and love all their products.
My son loves his Wubbanubs - he has five different ones, the monkey being the first one we got for him. He loves these so much and I love the fact that it is very hard to lose them unlike his regular pacifiers which are always rolling under the furniture or are just hard to see among his toys.    When he was a small infant, these were the only pacifiers he could keep in his mouth, because he could hold the stuffed animal part. That was a lifesaver for me because I didn't have to constantly give him back his pacifier when he woke up. Now that he is older, he doesn't need the stuffed animal part to help keep it in his mouth, but he loves the various animals he has. We are slowly trying to wean him off his pacifiers, but it is hard to refuse him his wubbas (as we call them) because he absolutely beams when he sees them.    The wubbanubs are very easy to clean and they have been very durable. I highly recommend Wubbanubs!
i won the sarah wells &#34;annie&#34; bag in a giveaway at the end of last year, while i was still expecting, and waited to write the review until i had a pump and could give a full in-action review!  i love this bag.  just out of the bag it is classy and looks like a nice work/shoulder bag, not like a pumping bag.  now that i've been using it for about two weeks, i feel the same.  it holds my pump and all the accessories needed for a day of pumping and also some of my work files and additional stuff.  it is a great bag and i'm so glad that i have it to use!  it's so much easier to be able to carry one bag, and maybe a purse if i need a larger one, than it was with my first child, when i had the pump bag, a work bag and a purse.  i have even used this one with my pump in it as a diaper bag too.  for anyone who is going to be needing to carry a breast pump and need a professional looking bag, this is a fabulous option.
i love these. i was concerned that the printed side wouldn't be as absorbent as the terry cloth side, but both sides are quick to absorbed moisture. i like the small size. depending on how i'm using them, i like to have some large burp rags and some small ones. these ones are great for wiping my baby's mouth, and because they're a little stiff the work great to cup under the baby's mouth when holding her up in a sit for a burp. if your holding your baby over your shoulder to burp, then these will definitely be too small.<br /><br />and of course, the pretty designs are very nice. not exactly as pictured though. i received two with flowered patters and two with the diamonds. no solid. i'm okay with that. i ordered these and the green ones. they came prettily wrapped in a large ribbon that says \\eat\\ all over it - very cute - with a large button on the front, not a knot. great for a gifts, but i got them for myself. :)
this travel cart made our experience at the airport with our 1 y.o. daughter a breeze! we knew we wanted to bring our britax marathon car seat along for our trip and having this cart meant we didn't have to lug a car seat around the airport (in addition to having a toddler, two carry-ons, and a backpack). we were able to use this as a &#34;stroller&#34; and since my daughter loves being in her car seat, she was happy to ride along. attaching the car seat to the cart was easy since it latches on using the car seat latches and anchor strap. we were stopped multiple times in the airport by people with positive feedback on how brilliant of a product this was. we had no problem maneuvering our 25 lb child in her car seat while attached to the cart. when it was time to board the plane, the cart easily folded up and was compact enough to store overhead. we couldn't be more pleased with this purchase - well worth the investment!
i gave this to some friends who just had a baby.  their experiences with it have all been good.  babies, apparently, like it when you hold them.  holding them usually takes hands, but this baby carrier does the whole holding part and suddenly dishes and other basic tasks become possible.  apart from free hands, my friends mentioned that adjusting and fitting the carrier straps was easy.  the only downside is that if the baby does not want in he can make it difficult to use, but this does not sound like a defect which can be held against the product designer as much as it can be held against the baby.<br /><br />my friends' baby is still more interested in looking at his parents, but when he really starts checking out the world they like the idea that he can be turned around to look at what they are doing.<br /><br />a perfect baby shower gift, but for very young or small babies note that there is a minimum weight of 8 lbs.
I'm not sure who loves this Wubby the best...me or my baby daughter.  The weight of the kitty cat helps keep the pacifier from falling out, which allows me some interruption-free sleep at night.    Now that she is a little older (almost 4 months), she likes to play with it, and strokes her hands over it while she is sucking the pacifier.  When it does fall out of her mouth, she tries to put it back in, although at this point she usually ends up sucking on a leg or tail instead.  :)  This little guy might seem a tad expensive for what it is, but I would buy another one in a heartbeat if this one got lost.    The kitty cat is very well sewn.  My baby tugs and pulls at the legs, and the stitching is holding up perfectly.  I'm not sure exactly how the Soothie pacifier is attached, but it is still attached after about 3 months of use.  I've also tossed it in the washing machine a couple of times (in a mesh bag) and drip dried it.
we didn't even own a high chair for our baby, and i see no reason to spend the big bucks or give up the space required for high chairs. plus, high chairs usually have cloth cushions which i do not understand one bit! we were happy using this instead. i love that every bit of it is easy to clean (the only non-plastic part is the buckle straps, which yes those get messy too sometimes). and i love that the white tray is removable and dish washer safe. i wish it had multiple white trays to switch out while the other is in the wash, but oh well. some seats are hard to snap the tray part on and off... we were going to buy a different seat but pulled it out of the box at the store to try the tray and it was so hard to get on and off. we tried this one and it was easy, so we ended up getting this seat instead and i'm glad we did. we also tossed this chair in the car to take along if we were going to someone's house- it was very handy.
i bought this pad to protect our bedding from all the spit up, diaper leaks, and you name it that comes from a baby. after reading the many reviews about the product material pilling, i was a bit concerned but decided to buy it and see for myself. i ended up buying 3 continental quilting waterproof pads to have around the house and also for back up so i'd always have a clean one if the others got dirty. boy am i happy with this product! it is perfectly sized, not too big, not too small, and completely waterproof as advertised. i've sent mine through the wash plenty of times and i'm happy to report that not a single one has had any pilling to speak of, considering that i have 3 of them i don't think it's luck of the draw that all three have not had any pilling. the fabric is not very soft however i just put a thin blanket over the pad so that my daughter is only in direct contact with the blanket covering the pad. love this pad!
love this bag and the color and ordered from elephantearsonline, they have great customer service (i've ordered from them before). i'm not sure if it was them or amazon who packaged the bag though because the packaging got seriously bent from the outside and, as a result, the bottom of the bag was bent as well. it's kind of reshaped itself after being stuffed and stored and amazon worked with me to resolve the issue. the sashay is a great bag, this is the second one i have right now (but i have had a total of five of them; i have a #petuniaproblem)--form and function works well for moms and any time you might have to carry more stuff and would like to at least have the option of being hands free. the *only* things i would caution on are 1. shallow outer bottle pockets 2. it's a deep bag so you need to figure out a system to organize it. personally ppb powder room cases are a favorite of mine and i would recommend those as well.
these are excellent seats.  highly-rated from both a safety standpoint and consumer happiness.  we have twins and had to buy two of these.  they're not the slimmest form, but they're not the widest, either.  in my 2013 wrangler unlimited (4-door wrangler) they take up a good portion of the back seat, but still leave enough room for our 8 year old daughter to reach the seat belt latch.<br /><br />in my wife's 2011 durango, they don't take up so much real estate that it makes my daughter uncomfortable to sit in the middle row, but the base does extend a bit over her latch and she has to push the seats aside in order to buckle her belt, which isn't easy to do considering how tight they're strapped to the seat.<br /><br />our boys are only 16 months old so they're still rear-facing.  the comfort, safety features, and even the design are top notch.  the boys are happy and comfortable and my wife and i are happy knowing they're safe.
Time savings is what the Clevamama Pacifier Tree is all about. This is a really handy contraption that gives the busy parent a quick, reliable, and easy way to keep pacifiers clean, sterilized, and together. Holds and sterilizes up to 6 pacifiers using the microwave as a super fast way to get things done. This is incredibly easier and quicker than boiling them in a pan of water on the range. As far as construction quality goes, it feels plenty sturdy. I can see no reason why it wouldn't hold up to regular use with no problem, provided you don't throw a tantrum and throw it against a wall, in which case you'll probably be needing the pacifiers for yourself instead of for baby. It really is a nice design, it's compact, making it easy to store in a cabinet or on a counter-top without it being invasive. Definitely one of those things you don't realize you need until you already have one, then wonder why you went so long without one.
we received this towel to review and we can't get enough of it! i have a 2 year old and almost 5 year old and we will have to get our hands on a second one. they both love it!! my older kid loves that he can finally control how well his towel stays closed and my younger loved how soft and fluffy it feels on her sensitive skin! the notch for hanging is great, our hooded towels all end up with little stretch marks in the hood from their hooks. it washed beautifully, only getting softer! i can understand the appeal for some with the white, it is classy and good for all ages. we live in a rental apartment and tend to use whatever color we can in things like this so i would love to see some great color options in the future! puj makes a corresponding hook, called a nub. i would have loved if that came with the towel.the price point is a bit high but after using it a few times, my advice would be this: if it's in your budget, grab one!
i fist saw these locks at my son's daycare.  they are amazing and i love that they don't require screws, which would mess up my cabinets.  these are really easy to install and my 21 month old son can pull to his heart's delight and they don't come open.  my husband, however, has managed to pull it open and broke one of the locks, but he had to pull pretty hard to do it.  you definitely need extra keys because there is nothing more frustrating than searching for a key to open your locks, hence the broken one by my husband.  my only problem with these is that they don't work well on drawers, as the drawers have a lip on them and they can't be installed.  they work wonderfully for cabinets though.  i highly recommend them!  i think that they would also work well for a cabinet, such as a medicine cabinet, that you don't want babysitters and other people to get in to.  for that kind of use, i would definitely use the screws to install.
This binky is pricey but a great alternative to all the plastic your baby is probably already sucking on.<br /><br />If your kid is around others who have similar binkies, though, you'll have to label this somehow. You could attach it to a clip, for example, or put a dot at the base in permanent marker. We've &#34;lost&#34; a bunch of these during childcare since they look so similar to other natural rubber ones.<br /><br />Another drawback: Drop it in the middle of the night, and you'll never find it. Good luck if you kick it with a toe while your baby is in your arms. It will find a way across the room to the point of no return until you put the baby down and turn all the lights on (maybe). Do they make glow-in-the-dark pacifier clips? If they do, they're probably toxic, and your baby shouldn't be in the crib with a binkie clip anyway.<br /><br />I still give this 5 stars because it's so well made and a great plastic alternative.
i received my rainier in the color glacier today. i was so excited to finally have it, but i was also somewhat stressed about putting it together after reading countless reviews on how hard it is to install. surprisingly, it wasn't as difficult as i thought it would be. our first car seat was a britax b-safe 5 point harness so we kind of already had a heads up on this system and adjusting all the straps.<br />we skipped right to the short instructional videos on youtube that help explain step by step how to step up the car seat in the car. let me tell you they were a life saver, there's nothing like watching someone actually setting it up instead of reading instructions and looking at the pictures.(i'm more of a hands on person)<br />the car seat looks very well constructed. it definitely feels very safe and incredibly comfy. the color was so nice, which was an added bonus. all in all, i'm very impressed and happy with this purchase!
We purchased this pacifier and the Brown Monkey pacifier for my son, along with other plain Phillips Avent Soothie pacifiers.  The WubbaNubs were by far my son's favorites, especially the Puppy (he even had a name for it), but that was probably because it was the first one we bought for him.  Infants look really cute sucking on these pacifiers and you will get a lot of comments.  We live overseas so you don't see these around here and we got asked many times where we bought them.  Before buying this item, I wasn't sure if it would be worth the extra money for these pacifiers vs. the plain Avent Soothies but I think it is well worth the extra money.  Even though these are easier to keep track of than plain pacifiers, we ended up losing a couple of them and replaced them, and some of the plain pacifiers, with the Brown Monkey, another Brown Puppy, and the Turtle.  We purchased others as gifts and have heard nothing but positive things.
Of my four children this is my first that will actually take a pacifier. She loves the Soothie kind so I got this to help her keep it in her mouth. We've had it since she was a couple of weeks old, she is 2 months old now. It is great. It helps her keep it in her mouth and if it pops out she is able to maneuver the giraffe on her own to get it back into her mouth! She loves holding onto the giraffe too. We also got the cat one but it doesn't seem to work as well, I think because it is shorter. I am going to order another giraffe to have as a backup. Also, we had thrush and I needed to boil it. I used clothespins to clip it to the side of the pan so just the pacifier was in the water. It worked fine, just had to watch to make sure it didn't fall and start a fire. Under normal circumstances you don't need to boil pacifiers anyways so it's not an issue. Generally I just throw it into a laundry bag in the washer a couple of times a week.
this suit was a lifesaver for my son... we started using it when he was maybe 4-5 months old to transition him from swaddled in the rock and play to unswaddled in his crib. the first night in it he slept all night (hadn't been prior to that). he was always so calm in his suit and never woke up transitioning from my arms to the crib. he slept late in the mornings (until 7:30 or so) and generally slept all night in it. the weight of it / fabric was perfect (we had the cotton in va) ... never too hot but kept him warm. fast forward to now... he's almost 8 months and i am trying to wean him off of it. it's going terribly to say the least. he became very dependent on the suit for all night sleeping. after a week of no sleep for me, i put him in it last night to try and let us all get some sleep and after being out of it, he was rolling over in it which he had never before attempted. i guess that's the end of our wonderful days in this suit
i used this daily as a safe place for my child to play for a few minutes while i get ready because it is small enough to fit in my bedroom, but roomy enough for a child to maneuver around.  we have also taken it on trips and found it extremely helpful as a safe, clean place to crawl around and burn off energy in airports, etc.  it is very easy to set up and take down quickly, and the bag is small/light enough to carry for a while.<br /><br />cons: (these aren't enough for me to take away a star, but they may be important to others)<br />- carrying: the bad only has fabric handles to carry the crib.  it would be better if the handles were padded, or if there was a shoulder strap.<br />- size: this is larger than standard carry-on size, so expect to hand it over at the gate like you would a stroller.  we had no trouble getting it on and off the plane un-damaged, but if we did it frequently, i would expect to see something scuffs or bending.
My friend bought one of these for my baby because her daughter loves it.  At first, I thought it was just a gimic and wouldn't be used much, but my one year old brings them everywhere he goes.<br /><br />After using it and regular pacifiers for a few weeks, we ended up only using the Wubbanubs.  My son was able to manipulate them to get them into his mouth at a very young age but had a harder time with regular pacifiers.  He would also drop the regular pacifiers but the fact that the animal is attached makes it harder to lose these. If you place it on top of baby's tummy when he (or she) is in his car seat, he can actually find it himself.  It stays there whereas a regular pacifier would drop to the side.<br /><br />We bought three different animals after the first one but my son's favorites are the monkey and the puppy.  He even tried to use both the monkey and puppy at the same time on a couple of occasions because he loves them so much.
i wasn't sure what to expect when i ordered this amber necklace, but it had great reviews and i thought i might as well give it a try.  i would much rather give my little girl some beautiful to wear than to pump her full of pain medication.  my daughter had been suffering terrible teething pains and all i know is she is doing a million times better now.  she adores the necklace.  i had her in my lap when i opened the package and right away she was drawn to it.  this does mean that the directions need to be followed and i absolutely never leave her alone with the necklace.  however, her whole demeanor has changed.  no more long crying jags.  i put the necklace on her and we sit with a small hand held mirror i have and i tease her, &#34;is that your necklace?  is that your necklace?&#34; and she just laughs and laughs.  so whether it's the amber, or the entertainment, i simply don't care.  i'm just so pleased to have a happy little girl again.
i was on the fence of buying this based on other poor reviews of an offensive odor, however i did not experience anything like that. i even took a whiff close up of the insert and couldn't smell anything offputting (and i'm 38 weeks pregnant!).<br /><br />i purchased this diaper bag insert for my summer tote bags to be converted into diaper bags. my daughter is 1.5 now and i don't have to tote nearly as much stuff as i did when she was younger. there is plenty of room to organize everything for her as well as my stuff in this.  it's really exactly what i needed and it's very simple to remove and transfer to another bag.  the insert fits perfectly into a new tote that i just got from target for only $30.  i like this solution so much more than having to tote around an actual designated diaper bag. it's more practical and i get to reuse my existing bags.  i'm glad of my purchase, and i've been using this for a few weeks now with no complaints.
We used the Soothie pacifiers until my daughter had her tongue and lip tie released at 8 weeks. After that procedure, she just didn't like any pacifiers any more. I've tried 5 different types and she hates them all. :(<br /><br />Sounds like a dream but sometimes it's nice to have something that soothes her other than breastfeeding.<br /><br />I read an article on these pacis and immediately ordered a set. Yes, I received the blue and red pacis instead of the more girly ones, but I don't care. They're pefect! She loves them! At 6 months when we're already dealing with sleep regression issues and a new tooth (and one more on the way) I'm thrilled that these provide comfort.<br /><br />I'm ordering two more sets now so we're not without them.<br /><br />Also, I can't seem to find these in local stores. They have the oval ones but they're not the orthodontic ones. Amazon is the only place I can find these softflex ortho pacis for 6+ month olds.
so this has served a couple of different purposes already!<br /><br />one - we used it at the hospital. with the nurses coming in and out through the night this made it easier without having to turn on the room lights and check on the baby.<br />two - our child is sleeping in the bassinet /play pen for the first few weeks in our room. its great to throw it into the corner of the play pen and check up on him without having to turn on the lights.<br />other intended uses- we plan to use this for traveling too. its small enough to take anywhere. i think its more permanent home will be by the changing pad to change him at night.<br /><br />pro's<br />- great battery life so far. lasts a full night.<br />- like the different colors. except maybe the red but green and blue are nice.<br />- cool to the touch.<br /><br />cons<br />- i wish the timer feature could be changed. then again i haven't looked back at the instructions to see if that is possible
Purchased as a replacement for our now defective Safety 1st 900 MHz Sight and Sound Nursery Monitor System (after 4 years of service), we are absolutely  amazed and impressed with the quality of the image during the day and the brilliant infrared-lit night vision of this camera / monitor combination.  Once you have *color* video (only when not using night vision), you will never contemplate getting a black and white one.    At 75 feet and three walls away, our kids' images and voices are perfectly clear when monitored from our bedroom.    Despite what one reviewer mentioned, we have had absolutely NO interference with our 802.11g wireless setup at home.  802.11g operates at 2.4 GHz, and this monitor is at 900 MHz.  There should not be interference.  Our monitor is literally 3 feet away from the access point, and our computers at 50 feet away and even out to the backyard remain connected and working just fine.    We highly recommend this product.
i would say, all play mats are great. if you are wondering if a play mat is worth it i can tell you that my daughter has been using hers everyday since she was 2 weeks old, now at 5 months she still enjoys it and it truly grows with the development of your baby.<br /><br />i specifically recommend the baby einstein variety because the are made to fold up and away just by picking them up.  it is much easier to keep it out knowing you can fold it up and put it in the closet or even just against the wall.  so far she has enjoyed all of the toys.  they are focused for different ages, the colored poles for newborn, the octopus and rattle for 2 month, the orca for tummy time and propping and teething star for older still.  you can easily integrate other hanging toys, but my kid has been pretty satisfied with the ones in this pack for a long time with only two other additions (lamaze moose and manhattan baby teether).  very easy to clean, quickly dries.
My son is not a fan of pacifiers, but if he's in the mood he'll use this or his Wubba Nub Nub that uses a Soothies pacifier.  I did not like this at first, because the tip doesn't have a radial symmetry that I was looking for, only a linear symmetry.  I was not able to tell true shape of the tip based on the pictures. I was hoping that it would be more like Soothies, but with a more bulbous tip so that it would stay in his mouth better.  Regardless, it doesn't seem to bother him.<br /><br />My favorite part about this pacifier though, is that when he drops it, it almost always with the mouth-part up.  Or 'butter-side-up' as it were.  The oval part is heavier, perhaps on purpose, so it almost always turns the pacifier 'in-flight' and lands in the ideal position.  Of course, a tether would be even better so that it couldn't be dropped on the floor at all.  But as I mentioned my son isn't a fan of pacifiers, so we don't have one leashed to him 24/7.
we purchased this product for our finicky newborn as a hail mary. nothing was helping him (or us get any sleep).<br /><br />i initially had no intention of using the vibrating feature as other vibrating contraptions didn't last long enoughenough or shut off abruptly and woke up our sleeping baby. but in this rocker, it is just an on/off switch. this thing has been going on the first battery install for a month and a half and still going. it vibrates overover night, we've even forgot to turn it off in between naps etc.<br /><br />the first night we put him in it was one if the best sleeps we've had. it didn't solve all our problems, but alleviated them.<br /><br />we have since learned that our little man has acid reflux and the angle if this rocker was just the thing.<br /><br />so in summary:<br />1.  love the angle for acid reflux<br />2. love the continuous vibrator<br />3. it's not a battery guzzler<br />4. love that we now are getting sleep.
after reading plenty of reviews (like you are doing now) about entertainers, i chose this one because of its better-than-the-rest safety reviews.  our 4 month old really loves this and has worked up to about 15 or 20 minutes at a time.   <br /> <br />she can just about stand flat-footed, but not quite, so we put a bath mat under her feet, which works great because the rubber back doesn't slip around when she tries to twist herself, and the rug gives her more traction than just her socks on the plastic bottom. also, we put her in the seat backwards as she doesn't have 100% control over herself yet, and it really helps; she is able to lean against the high part of the seat, yet her arms are still over the top to play with the toys.  <br /> <br />not many cons to this product.  if i had to nitpick, i might take off the hand puppet - it seems to be too close and just gets in her way, and she has no interest in playing with it. this is a great product!
i absolutely love the \\bunnies by the bay\\ line of toys and special blankets and clothing for babies! the animals are as soft as a new babie's bottom, and the clothing is disigned to be comfortable next to the skin...yet styled with soft layers of sheer fabrics that would make a wonderful gift special enough to use in a special occasion photo shoot! i am delighted with the items i bought for my newest grandaughter,\\honny bunny\\ soft toy bunny,and a gorgeous \\bunnies by the bay..pink dressing gown\\! all of the bunnies by the bay merchandise is so irresistable,..i want to buy it all![[asin:b00485c4ca bunnies by the bay blossom's girlie gown, pink, 0-3 months]]the prices are reasonable. i definately will recommend this store to friends and family. it is my new shop for baby showers, birthdays, and any other special occasions. aaa+...forgot to mention...free shipping and very tasteful free gift wrapping! sincerely satisfied customer,@middlesister
i wish i'd known about this pillow from the start. we started using it when my daughter was two months old, after her pediatrician became concerned about a flat spot on her head. (it was to the point that it was messing with the symmetry of her face.)<br /><br />we noticed a difference when we used it, but she started daycare at 2.5 months and we regressed. fortunately, we were able to get daycare on board with using one, too, and it's made all the difference in the world. after two months of consistent use, she is no longer a candidate for a helmet.<br /><br />we own two and use it in her crib (yes, i know the risks), swings, activity gym, etc. you have to be diligent about using it, but if you start early, it can make a big difference. my only complaint is that i think they're ugly as all get out, i wish boppy would make more color options/patterns that aren't so bleh, but it's still better than suffering through a hot houston summer with a helmet.
out of the swing, the play mat and this, my daughter sits for the longest in this before she starts to gripe to be picked up. and for a baby that usually wants to be held all the time, i don't what i'd do without it. before i got this, she would just cry the whole time i would try to eat and feed my son. now she just sits there content while i can get something done. and i don't think the vibrating is too hard like some other people said, when i put her in it without it on and then turn it on, she smiles really big. i also don't see a problem in how deep the seat is or the cushion. and i would prefer this over one that is more stimulating, babies can get over stimulated. i think this one is just right to keep her occupied. she loves to sit there and look at the butterflies. and i also don't take the toy bar off just to put her in and out, i just make sure i hold her low enough and a little to the side while passing under it so they don't hit her face.
my baby girl has been on and off sick with a cold for pretty much her entire short little life. when she was diagnosed with rsv on top of all that snot, i sent my husband on a hunt to find this thing because i tried everything else with no luck. after trying two targets and a walgreens (all were out of this little gem), he landed at buy buy baby and finally brought it home. it is a life saver! i will say that it does take some magical powers to hold the baby down and suck all by yourself and my daughter absolutely hates it but it works great! i usually hold my arm across her chest and arms to hold her down and then suck.  you will not believe all that comes out and she breathes so much better afterwards. i like that i can take it apart and clean it versus that bulb thingie that gets filled up with mold. ick!  i would say that the nosefrida is a must have for anyone with kiddos. i've used it on both my baby girl and my 7 year old and it truly is a gem!!!
my daughter is 4.5 months old and we just pulled this toy out for her to play with...she loves it. the lights really capture her attention and she gets very excited at the music. the songs are much less annoying than most baby toys and there are enough of them that it takes a while before you hear the same one twice.<br /><br />we use this when she's laying on her back sometime but it's best at tummy time or when she's sitting up. on her back and sitting up she loves to reach for it while we move it around. on her tummy we use it to encourage her to track side to side and up and down. she lifts her head up really far and looks up quite high to follow it.<br /><br />its a little heavy for her to hold on her own still...but i expect we will get great mileage out of this toy as she grows. happy i have 2...had thought about giving one away but will keep the second one so we have one to keep in the diaper bag for going out and one to keep at home to play with.
My husband and I bought this for our 2 month old who has been having problems going to sleep at night and seems to hate the dark. After sleeping with a light or tv on we wanted to get some type of night light. I was weary of this since it doesn't play music and it looked kind of generic to me. However this is the best thing we've bought our son yet. The first time turning it on, his eyes lit up and he got really excited. We use it every night now and turn it back on during our middle of the night feedings. He immediately looks up in awe and starts to get sleepy again. I've put this on a shelf, on the floor, and even in his bassinet when he wasn't in it and it's always worked perfectly. For the amber glow to work you need a very dark room, but hey that's what the middle of the night is. The amber glow also seems to be the most calming and puts him to sleep quickly. Worth every penny! Highly recommend for infants who are fussy about going to sleep at night.
I ordered the elephant Wubbanub first. I loved it and so did my daughter. She was about 6 weeks old when I got it, and it really helped her keep the paci in her mouth. It would rest on her belly and give that extra support to keep it there. Unfortunately, my dog chewed it up. I loved the product so much that I immediately came on here to order a new one. The elephant was gone, so I chose the caterpillar. Great choice! I think it helps keep the paci in her mouth even better than the elephant. My daughter is now almost 8 weeks old, and she even looks like she is physically holding the caterpillar when she uses it. It will fall out of her mouth but stay close enough that she can root around and get it back in there quite often. Plus, it is adorable! I only wish it were removeable so that it could be better washed and she would be able to keep the toy once she no longer needs the paci or I could replace the paci if, oh, my dog chewed that part up or something.
We were given this pacifier by a friend who received a box of them when her child was in the NICU. It is the BEST for nursing babies!! I wanted my son to be able to self-soothe without using his thumb or fingers, but was determined to nurse without supplementing. After a week of using the gumdrop and seeing no changes in my son's nursing, we ordered our own box of 10. We were soooo pleased- they are hospital grade and come individually wrapped and sterilized. I am a germaphobe and LOVE that I could just pop open the package and have a fresh, clean pacifier. They are also so light that they never disturbed him at night, so there was NO getting up to give him his pacifier- he just slept on. My son nursed like a champ for a year and we switched to a Nuk when he outgrew the gumdrop. The day he turned 2, he handed me his paci and said No paci, Mommy...and that was it. We will DEFINITELY use the gumdrop again for the next baby, and Gumdrops make great baby gifts!
Wubbanubs are super cute and cuddly. My daughter has used them since birth and she doesn't know any other pacifier. By age 2 her teeth are still perfect and i don't see any indication at this point any teeth being crooked or anything like that. The pacifier is soft and a good quality, nothing your baby would chew and swallow.<br /><br />Would recommend to all new mommy's and daddy's and grandmas too!<br /><br />It makes a great baby shower Gift....one that won't be forgotten!<br /><br />Ive seen ugly red marks on my friends babies faces from using other pacifiers..They are hard plastic so of course they do!!!!<br />Especially when they have been sucking on them all night!!!<br /><br />Long lasting.. My daughter still has two she's had since birth and the nipple is still thick and perfect...<br /><br />Great for teething<br /><br />Helps baby find her paci easy!!<br /><br />PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF THIS REVIEW HAS HELPED YOU WITH YOUR PURCHASE OR INQUIRY! THANKS
i wanted to write a review because i relied a lot on them when buying our second bouncer.  we had the rainforest jumperoo with my daughter two years ago and all the reviews on it were still so good that i almost duplicated my purchase for our five and a half month old son.  instead, we decided to try this new bouncer and are glad we did.  he likes it just as much as our daughter liked hers and i think the toys on here are actually more interactive.  it took him two weeks of sitting in it for 5-10 minute increments to realize that the chair bounced and he could actually bounce around.  he now loves it and will squeal for 20-30 minutes easily spinning around in the chair.  the hanging red monkey is his new best friend and the chew toy frog has been slobbered on a lot already.  although i agree that the base is not quite as sturdy, i'm in no way nervous that he is going anywhere.  you really cant go wrong with either one....pick which theme you like the best :)
I was so reluctant to have my babies use pacifiers, and I waited until well after I had established breastfeeding to really give these a go. But now that we use these (just to help them go to sleep), I can't believe we waited so long. We initially received these in the hospital, but I chose not to use them for a while. But then my lactation consultant noted that the Gumdrop/Soothie nipple is definitely fine for breastfed babies, and so I decided to try to use them in place of me when they needed to go to sleep, especially during the day. My babies were sucking just for comfort ALL THE TIME, and while some of that is good (and good for your milk supply), most women probably can't spend all day serving as a human pacifier. Enter the Gumdrop. My babies both love it. If they are tired, they'll go to sleep immediately after the Gumdrop goes in their mouths. These pacifiers rarely fall out and don't cover up their cute little faces like the Soothies do. Big, big fan.
Not only are these incredibly cute, but it is fantastic for those times when binky pops out of the mouth in the middle of the night and baby wakes up and needs to find it. I spent months getting up in the middle of the night, multiple times, to retrieve a binky that either rolled out of the crib or baby couldn't find it. This one is easy to find in the crib and it won't fall out of the crib!! This is essential to parents' sanity and sleep!! We get tons of comments on this because it's so cute and unusual. I've even washed this in the washing machine (air dry) and it didn't fall apart. After probably a year of solid use, the binky part did eventually come off of the elephant, but I re-attached it with a safety pin and it's still being used. The biggest downfall of this binky is that other kids really want to steal it! :-) I would absolutely recommend this product for you and for every baby shower you ever attend! I can't say enough good words about this product.
this gate is fantastic! not only does it fit perfectly in an ordinary doorway, but it's tall enough to keep my dogs from going over it (even our great dane), which is exactly what we wanted. it was pretty easy to install and i bet the extensions would be as well! we just didn't need extensions because our doorway was the first setting for the gate. we didn't use the hardware with the cups that it comes with to secure it against the wall because we aren't so much using it for safety, but to keep our dogs out of the nursery. however, if you plan on using this on stairs or somewhere that would be hazardous for the baby to get into, the safety cups that secure it strongly to the wall with screws are completely necessary in my opinion. the swing shut gate works perfectly as long as you adjust it to the doorway correctly. it's very smooth and easily maneuvered. this gate is tall, versatile, and perfect for every need. overall, the gate is everything we wanted and more!
i have the recaro seat for two years now and my daughter loves it not only does she like its comfort but she likes having the same kind of seat her mom and dad use my evo has recaro seats and they are great when i saw recaro made baby seats it was a no brainer i immediately bought one it installs in less than a minute securely. the best features are ones you hope you never need like the soft yet firm side crash protectors great if your car has side airbags which can harm a child without side supports and also shoulder pads to help prevent the harness from rubbing the kids face and the best one yet the crotch pad which my daughter thinks is a toy and yanks it off tosses it at me laughing every time while im strapping her in. basically its a great safe light weight good looking seat that can be used for your child on an airplane! yes you read correctly an airplane since small children dont fit in standard airplane seats they can and do use this seat for air travel!
amazing, love, love, love it !!! all 5 stars all the way !<br />i would buy this stroller all over again. so easy to fold, perfect size. my husband is 6'5&#34; and i am 5'4&#34; and new improved handle works for both of us beautifully. it &#34;glides&#34; on the pavement, turns so well.<br />it fits in my toyota carolla trunk with such ease and i think i could fit another one of these strollers if i wanted to. still have so much space of rather large items.<br />it is a bit heavier than i thought, but still happy with the overall weight.<br />also with the car seat adapter my peg perego car seat fits beautifully with just one click it is locked in! i love it, functional, saves time, and made my life so much more easy.<br />also on amazon it was prices the best, lots of other sites wanted over $350.00 for this stroller, amazon has the best deal by far, i also combined it with an extra 20% coupon on top of the deal.<br />i highly recommend this one, it is a keeper!!!
I was anti-pacifer. Then I had my baby. Amazing how things change!<br /><br />My son is about a month old and has reflux, which is apparently really common in newborns. Suckling helps the reflux - which means he was nursing constantly - CONSTANTLY. Sometimes 3 to 4 hours in one session. Now that he is back up to birth weight, he was given the clearance for pacifers and bottles. This is the only pacifer that he took to - and it has saved my sanity. Probably his, too. Now that he's not getting a constant supply of milk, his number of spit ups has decreased. But he is still suckling, which helps the reflux. And he's not suckling on me, which gives my body a chance to recuperate. He flat out rejected other pacifers, except this one. I also like that it has the finger hole - I can hold his head with one hand and still have a finger in/on the binky to help hold it in place, and still have another hand free.<br /><br />Buy one pack. If your baby likes it, too, then load up!
my sensory-seeking 3.5 yr old would chew on his shirt collars when he got anxious. when i first sent him to preschool, he was quite nervous about the new environment and being away from mom for the first time. so, as his favorite color is red, and he loooooves cars and trucks, i bought him this, which he calls his &#34;chewy car&#34;. it helped him immensely in his transition to the new environment, and he loves the thing. (it actually feels like a friend for him, in the same way a stuffed animal might. i make it &#34;talk&#34; about feelings, etc.) i put a red grosgrain ribbon through the hole, and sewed on a breakaway plastic clasp to make it into a necklace for him. he can put it on over his head himself, but it can break away in an emergency if it gets caught on anything. i wrote his name and my phone number on the ribbon. it hangs on his room doorknob when not in use, so he always knows where it find it. it's still in great shape, with his moderate/occasional use.
I can't say enough about these...we had about 6 for the whole time he was using them..no more lost pacifiers and he could easily put it back in himself at a very young age.  Also by a few weeks old he would be petting them as he went to sleep. I had to return to work at 5 weeks and by 3mos he was sleeping 12 hours through the night with the help of this pacifier.  After the first couple of weeks searching for the pacifier in the dark (he was in my bed in a sleeper thingamajig for week 5-10) I found these!! I worried he would have too much of an attachment to the stuffed animal but he was off this and the bottle by 18 months.  Also, the pacifier is the one they use in the hospital so you don't have to worry about switching.  I washed it in the dishwasher and air dried and also just washed the pacifier part often.  we did lose a few at others houses and had to replace 1 or 2 when they were worn but for the extra sleep those first couple of months, it was well worth the $$$.
even if you aren't cloth diapering, or you're using a different system (we're using gdiapers), a good stash of prefolds is an absolute must. we use them as burp cloths, bibs, napkins, makeshift changing pads, pillows, blankets, emergency diapers for the occasional \\oops\\ on the changing table -- you name it. it's our all-purpose, go-to rag for baby goo of all kinds.<br /><br />these bumkins premium prefolds quilted up nicely in the wash and are super soft and absorbent. this is the size you want for a multi-purpose burp cloth, as i find the infant size too small to be effective. we have two dozen, and that's a good stash if you don't plan to use them as diapers. double that if you do!<br /><br />update: the dimensions of these are 14.5\\ x 22\\ before washing. after several washes, they shrink to about 12\\ x 18\\, with a bit of variation depending on how much they quilt up. we bought another dozen, and are using them to stuff our gdiapers for overnight. still love these!
If your child loves their pacifier, then this is a must have item.  I have bought a lot of specialty baby items because they were supposed to be amazing and help their child develop and make parenting easier.  Most of the items I have gotten just sit in a box after being examined by the baby once and then tossed away in a fit of indifference.<br /><br />One thing that my baby has loved since day 2 has been a pacifier.  She is a big pacifier baby.  I learned quickly that even though young babies can't control their movements and can't throw things, a pacifier that just falls out of their mouth still has the ability to roll far enough away to never be found again.<br /><br />Wubbanubs actually solve this problem.  When a pacifier falls, it can't go far.  If it is thrown, it is easily found.  And when babies start being able to control their hands, they can grasp the stuffed animal and bring it to their mouth much earlier than they would be able to with just a normal pacifier.
I got this in the hope to get my second kid hooked on pacifiers.  If anything to maybe enjoy a car ride with an infant, as my first child was miserable to be around when in a vehicle. Six months later: She uses it, cuddles it, loves flinging it around.  The 2 year old loves it and made it her personal mission to be on &#34;kitty fetching duty&#34;, for the baby whenever she fussed.  We love it cause she's happy in the car, sleeps with it when she's not cosleeping, and it's cute.<br /><br />Our first one the nose embroidery unraveled at about 4 months, but I just cut it off, so what if kitty has a pink nose or not.  We got a second and I noticed that old and new were quite similar; with weekly/biweekly soaks in oxiclean, 6 months of wear doesn't really show.  Now one lives in the carseat and one lives in the crib. The product picture is slightly different, the kitties have white &#34;pads&#34; to the feet, not tabby pattern.<br /><br />Happy with our purchase, worth the expense.
my 1 year old daughter has been wearing this all winter. our house drops to about 62 degrees at night, and she is very comfortable sleeping with this and fleece feety pajamas. she's had a few accidents (and a noseblood... and a vomiting incident.. being a parent is so much fun!) and it has laundered very well. the zipper tucks up nicely in the little cloth slot, and it's actually very possible that she'll still fit in it next winter when she's 2.5 - she's a slightly above average height, average weight toddler.<br /><br />it might just be a coincidence, but she was having horrific sleep problems before we bought this, and she's been mostly sleeping through the night ever since. it breaks my heart to think that she might have been cold that whole time and our last double-pjs + blanket weren't sufficient... but who really knows.<br /><br />if you live in a cold, drafty farmhouse and you turn the heat down at night, this is the sleeping bag to get for your toddler. you won't be sorry!
These are the pacifiers that my hospital gave us for our daughter. As a new mom I was TOO careless with them. They were lost within two weeks and I quickly learned that my recklessness was going to come at a cost. These are the ONLY soothies that my daughter would use. We tried others and she would just spit them right back out. I made it a point to purchase a pack of these immediately in store and then order these ones as a back up. It's that critical to have spares. Do not mess around.<br />I found that these soothies work great whether your are breast or bottle feeding. We did both and I found that it helped her transition between nipples well. No latch confusion. It also helps to be able to insert your finger into the hole if your baby is teething so they can alternate between sucking on the soothie and clamping down for their gums.<br />Also, these things are SO easy to sterilize. And I've never had an issue with them ripping.<br /><br />If only I could get my second to use them!
Of the eight of these we have, two are the giraffe. We have used these pacifiers since the day we brought my son home and are so happy with them. He was/is a preemie and in the beginning they were the size of his head- didn't stop him from trying to use them. In fact this is the only type of pacifier my son will take. At eight months he decided he was through with co-sleeping and these have been a lifesaver. If he wakes up he can easily find them in his crib and go right back to sleep. He looks so cute when I go to get him in the mornings. Even if he's not sucking on the plug he's hugging his little friend. :) I just bought another and will probably buy more in the future.<br /><br />If ever there was a perfect baby shower gift this would be it. I think every new Mum should be handed one of these, a swaddling blanket and instructions to put this in their baby's mouth then wrap them into the swaddle with the baby. We've had nothing but good nights since we discovered that little trick!
my son will not sleep in the crib for longer than 20 minutes. he doesn't have reflux and he likes to play on his back, so i have no idea why he won't sleep that way. i tried everything i could think of, including a vibrating matt that goes under the mattress, with no luck at all. i was really at the end of my rope when a friend suggested i buy this. first night i tried it i knew it was going to be worth every penny. my son has been using this now for about a month and a half with great results for both of us. my only complaint is how little padding it has. i put some layers of felt between the cover and the hard plastic back for some extra cushioning. i think that problem is addressed with the more expensive versions.<br />update: my son used this every night for 5 months. it was absolutely the best baby thing i have ever purchased, besides maybe the white noise machine. i moved my son out of it when i stopped swaddling him. if your baby won't sleep in the crib then give this thing a try.
we just bought the small wheely pig for my son for his first birthday. he is a bit young but when the snow melts, he'll be old enough to use it outside. for now, he sits on the floor and rolls it like a car. he also loves to pull the tail and pat its head. just doing that, he has given his wheely a lot more use than most of his electronic toys.  the first thing i noticed is how sturdy this thing is. i feel like i could sit on it and it won't break. the price tag is steep but you can't get this kind of quality from plastic toys. it -will- last you several years, even with a rough kid. it's also super cute and very appealing visually with its simple design.  i had the idea in my head that the child is supposed to have their legs bent a little in order to scoot it around. i think a normally sized 2 year old would fit this just fine and you wouldn't need the larger one. my son is in the 90th percentile in height and he can barely touch the floor on the small- he can't scoot it even if he tried.
these training pants are essentially very thick, absorbent undies.<br /><br />material:  the fabric is very, very soft and feels high-quality.  the stretchy waist and leg openings are also very soft, not binding or itchy.  the inner layer is almost fleecy/fuzzy, but it doesn't pill like fleece does.  the colors stay bright.  the photo shown here of the giraffe print is totally accurate -- it's a bright, happy orangey-yellow print on bright white.<br /><br />absorbency:  these are halfway between underwear and diaper.  there is no waterproof layer, but since they are thicker than undies, they can hold a bit of moisture.  a little pee dribble will stay contained, but the child will feel wet.  a full-on pee will soak the training pants and run onto the floor.  so, be prepared -- don't let your kid wear these on grandma's fancy sofa unless you are very, very confident.<br /><br />fit:  these fit great.  i would say that they run true to size or a little bit small.  if in doubt, definitely size up!
good wet bag, adorable design. i got the foxy frolic print which has a white background, and because this is a single layer bag, it's rather see through. i use this for my cloth diapers, and while i haven't had a problem yet, i could see messes smearing inside and being visible through the bag. while it's not going to go through the material, it'd be kinda gross to see. or, if you have an easily embarrassed child, their wet underwear could be seen through the lighter material.<br /><br />i actually prefer the lite wet bag over the double layer wet bag by planet wise (i bought the double layer style first - 2 large and 1 medium). the double layer bags tends to collect and hold water in the waterproof side during the wash cycle and it's an extra step to get the liner fully empty and reset into the cloth outer bag so it can fully dry. plus, i tend to wonder if the water that is trapped in the liner side is clean or not. this bag being a single layer is much easier to flip inside out and back again.
i bought this feeding chair for my youngest because i was tired of tripping over the regular high chair and wanted more space in the kitchen.  i am very happy with it.  as others have said, it is way easier to clean than most high chairs and it is easy to adust the recline.  i will say that i had to get the hang of using the recline, but once i figured it out, it's a breeze.  my son is 17 mo and he isn't sitting up on his own due to a medical condition.  he can feed himself and so he needs to be in a sitting up position, just slightly reclined.  i needed a chair that had a high enough back to \\cradle\\ and support his head, yet one that was lightweight and portable enough that we could take it to restaurants.  i bought the fisher-price healthy care booster seat, too and the back wasn't high enough for my son who cannot sit up yet.  that chair was more portable because it folds, but for my son, it didn't work.  overall, this chair is great and i wish i had known about it with my first child, too!
after recently purchasing my first set of bellee baby bibs, i used them for the first time tonight.  there were a number of things i liked about this bib, especially how easy it was to use and clean.  i was able to place the bib around my baby girl's neck without problem and she did not seem uncomfortable.  i liked how it laid across my daughters chest and tummy, covering a good portion of her upper body.  for being a plastic bib, it seemed light weight and not took bulky.  the only thing i had difficulty truly determining was how well it actually would keep my baby clean it because she enjoyed chewing on the neckline.  the neck piece has small little bumps along the edge, which she found to be quite soothing for her little teeth.  however, this pretty much made the bib pointless because she got a good portion of her shirt dirty from all the food that dripped down the back of it.  i would definitely recommended this bib and feel that as my baby girl gets bigger, the bib will get better with time!
My friend suggested this little dude and I was hesitant to purchase it after my dismay with a similar binky holder for the Tommee Tippees, but this guy is great!<br />After watching her daughter with hers I thought I would give it a try and I am so happy I did. My little guy uses this at nap time and sometimes at night when he sleeps in his swing (upright). He will randomly spit the binkie out when he is sleeping and freak out during the middle of the night to find it. As long as he has not swatted it away, he can easily find it on his chest.<br /><br />I have heard that it improves when they get a little older and have more hand control, right now he is 3 months and is able to grab it but often tosses it instead of bringing it to his mouth.<br /><br />The monkey is very cute and comes with an avent binkie attached. You cannot remove the binkie, but you can easily clean it with the monkey attached.<br /><br />I will purchase this for many a baby shower coming up as it has been a great item to have.
Great baby shower gifts!!<br />If you choose to use a pacifier this is a must have for infants! With our first child we used traditional pacifiers and we were constantly having to put it back in our child's mouth when it would fall out. But not the Wubba! This toy/pacifier is ingenious! It cuts down the need to replace it in the child's mouth drastically. If baby is sleeping with their head tilted to the side you can gently position Wubba so it is a prop up to hold the pacifier in baby's mouth. When baby is on their back looking up at the ceiling you place wubba on their chest and even if their little mouth relaxes and falls open during sleep, Wubba holds the pacifier gentaly in place so when baby seeks it -it is there! Before you know it little one will be holding on to it (great for helping to develop dexterity) and its too cute! We used to joke about how we wished there was a type of pacifier headgear... Well this is the closest thing to that without the odvious no-no's a headgear would bring ;-)
We had another pacifier that was given from the hospital. The one that we used was really good too except that it was too heavy for infants. Out son is now 8 weeks old and he always love to suck on a pacifier to comfort himself and we needed one to put him to sleep except the old one would fall out from his mouth when he was just about to fall asleep. So we we went to BabiesRUs to get a new one. This is the one that we bought. It's pricy compared to other ones but we wanted to right one so we didn't have to waste money on trying out multiple pacifiers.   This one is great. It stays in!! The only thing that bothers me is that water does get into the pcifier and we have to clean it really thoroughly. However, if we shake the pacifier really well, the water will go out and as I observed the pacifier, the water will not get back to our son's mouth.   We got another one from Amazon so we have 2 handy. However, I would probably go back to the old ones when he can suck on something that's a little heavier.
my husband and i got this mobile to match the hampton bedding set and i have not experienced any of the problems mentioned by other reviewers.  <br /> <br />one thing to make note of however is that the assembly directions that come with the mobile are not for the exact model that this one is, so the instructions are not 100% accurate. there is actually less assembly required for this one since the hanging pieces are already attached to the fabric canopy, so all you do is fit the plastic hanger pieces together... (which you will want to do with caution as the picture illustration is backward to how it really has to go together and if you dont pay close attention you could try to force it in wrong and break it). if your crib has wide top railings or round top railings then this mobile will not work for you as the arm has a lip that helps secure it that will not work on wide sections of railing. <br /> <br />i still rate this a 5 because for us we had no problems at all and it really is a beautiful mobile.
this mobile is outstanding in design. i've had many models for three kids over the last 8 years and this is by far the one i wished i'd had from the beginning. it's really user friendly, very sturdy and safe, colorful, and there is a lot of activity going on. i've read some other reviews, but decided to purchase anyway despite the claims of it being too loud and using up batteries too quickly. i can say that after a year, i've changed the batteries once. the unit is used for about 40 min a day four days a week. i would say that's not too bad in battery costs. the unit is not quiet. the  motor makes noise, the music box has different volume settings, and there are the links clinking as the mobile turns. however, i myself find the whole symphony of those noises to be soothing, even for myself.  there is a rhythm in place that calms you, and i find my baby is really interested and soothed by it. on the nights she isn't exhausted and needs to be calmed to fall to sleep on her own, i consider this a lifesaver.
vehicle i installed this car seat in:  2013 mazda cx-9<br /><br />car seat color: waverly-chose the brown color because it matched my car interior and because of the reviews stating the black/gray got hot in the sun.<br /><br />installation: britax has a bunch of videos on youtube showing exactly how to install this car seat and i highly recommend watching them before your seat arrives.  it made installation a snap!  if you have an older vehicle (pre 2008) i would watch the videos before ordering the seat to make sure you have the components in your vehicle to install this correctly.<br /><br />thoughts:  we own the chicco keyfit 30 and have nothing but high praise for it.  the switch to this car seat was easy and my daughter loves it. it has plenty of padding around the buckle and on the shoulders. the velcro to hold the straps to the side is a nice touch and helps with loading a bit (the velcro could be an inch thicker though).  i would also recommend getting a seat cover to prevent seat marks or rubbing.
this is one of the most high quality, well thought out baby thing i've encountered.<br /><br />it started with unpacking. it actually had repacking instruction on the box (and the manual).<br />this is great they thought ahead so we can pack it away between babies.<br /><br />the instructions are also amazing. a real rarity with baby products i'm discovering.<br /><br />to the important part:<br />i works very well. you can choose the motion types and the speed. you are bound to find something baby will like.<br />baby looked comfortable. it's not rigid, i wish the back support for the baby was a little more rigid so it doesn't curl the baby up. it's good if you keep it reclined all the way<br />the speakers are the only drawback. very cheap/bad sounding speakers.<br /><br />the motor isn't silent or very quiet but babies won't care about that.<br /><br />some extras:<br />you can attache a phone or music player with provided headphone jack<br />you can control the whole thing with your phone with bluetooth.
our 5-month old's neurologist recommended to use a sleep positioner to help him sleep on the less-favored side of his head, allowing the head to round out.  we have tried a few products, and this one works the best for keeping him in position without wiggling out of the positioner.      the material is extremely breathable, so we are not worried about overheating.  the wedges are adjustable with velcro and stay securely in position.  they can be folded inwards to change the angle of the wedge's incline.     we have found that the best way to use the product for treating his head shape is this:  the two wedge pieces are kind of pointy, so we fold one point in (like this:  >)  and leave the other in vertical position (like this: ^).  we set the baby's back/shoulder (not head) on the folded-over (>) wedge so that he will favor the round side of the back of the head.  his other side rests just inside the vertical (^) wedge so that he won't slide out of the positioner.  it has worked quite well--highly recommended!
My son loves NUK at all times. He is 4.5 months now. we try to avoid the paci during day. In the night we let him have one.<br /><br />NUK fits his mouth perfectly. He does spit it out once in a while but mostly he holds it in..<br /><br />Soothie - well he doesn't recognize soothie as a pacifier. For some reason, he doesn't suck on it most of the days. Even when he is cranky, he will not suck on soothie for long. Probably the shape of it doesn't appeal to him. I cannot talk about how habit forming it is, as my son is just 4.5 months old.<br /><br />NUK Pros:<br /><br />My son loves it, he is able to hold it in his mouth for long periods<br />Orthodontic, so I worry less about my sons teeth allignment<br /><br />NUK cons:<br /><br />Water enters the nub when I wash the paci. I squeeze and shake to get it out.<br />Sometimes when he sucks it for too long, the shape of the exterior of the paci leaves an impression around his lips.<br />In amazon, pink color and green color are paired, boy colors are not exclusive.
i love this bouncy seat! i'm a bigger fan of amazon than babies r us but they had this same seat for $25. it's adorable and refreshingly simple. a lot of baby stuff i find kind of obnoxious looking; neon primary colors and things hanging everywhere that light up and make off key noise. i don't think babies need that much artificial stimuli. the baby trend stuff looks like baby gear with a sense of taste. it's neutral colors and low-tech. this bouncy seat is very easy to assemble, it's sturdy, and the material is soft and velvety. the hanging toys are so cute and quiet yet entertaining. and they can be removed to wash or put on different toys if you like. well made, very safe bouncy seat that actually looks good in any room. i don't know how anyone with a baby could live without one of these, you can actually get some chores done around the house with baby happily bouncing away. i also have the matching monkey around play yard which is absolutely wonderful! i highly recommend the whole baby trend monkey around set!
if my sons could talk, they would tell you this is currently their 2nd favorite toy, right after their jumperoo.  they love the bright colors on the mat, and teething on the little stuffed \\feet\\ that are on the worm during tummy time.  their favorite toy is the bug rattle.  i have not had safety issues with this toy. the bar has never fallen over on them, and the toy is lead-free.  zipped up, it is amazingly compact, so it travels well, or stores well in a small space.  i don't think there is a toy in the world that a child under 6 months old could safely be left alone with, so i wouldn't let that comment in previous reviews influence my decision in purchasing this basically safe and very fun toy.  developmentally this provides all the right activities.  if i could change any one thing about this toy it would be that it really only fits kids 0-6 months.  [[asin: b0018979my infantino's monkey's jungle retreat]] grows with the child beyond 6 months, and if i'd known that sooner, i'd have bought that first/instead.
My daughter loves wubbanub pacifiers.  We also have the monkey and have used them since she was 5 weeks old.  I also bought Nuk because that is what I used as a kid but switched for two reasons.  First, a lactation consultant said that these straight-nipple pacifiers are better for breast-feeding babies (or if you are trying to get your baby to breastfeed).  Second, she was given this brand of pacifier (the soothie, no stuffed animal attached) in the hospital and she preferred it to the Nuk pacis.  I tried my hardest for the first 5 weeks to get her to like the Nuk because I bought 3 packages but she loved the soothie from the hospital.  I saw these and noticed they used soothie and figured I'd try it.  She loved it right away.  She could hold it and it stayed in a little better than Nuk.  I will continue to buy these because she plays with them even when she is not putting the pacifier part in her mouth.  They have many different animals and if you check, certain animals go on sale for a few bucks off from time to time.
my husband and i fell in love with this bedding as soon as we saw it. we spent weeks trying to find a bedding for our upcoming son and this, to us, is perfect. it passed the first wash/dryer test with pretty much no problems, all the seams and stuffing stayed in tact. one word for the wise is that the material on the sheet, dust ruffle, diaper hanger, and valance wrinkled in the wash badly, (because of the type of material) so expect to spend some time ironing when done (afterword i thought it may have been better to only wash those things the baby will come in contact with like the sheet and bumper pads and left the rest alone). i consider that a first time mom's live and learn experience. also be careful of shrinking which i did notice slightly with the dust ruffle only. <br /> <br />overall we are extremely happy with the product, its absolutely adorable  (it looks much better in person than in the pictures...which i thought were great!) for the quality and cost for this 6-piece set, i really dont think you can beat it.
i have been cding my baby for eight months now.  i started out with aios but found that i prefer the cost-effective prefolds with snappis and covers.  i used the duo size 1 with small prefolds for seven months and they fit great until baby reached between 16 and 17 pounds, the same time she outgrew the small prefolds.  the medium prefolds fit okay in the size 1 if folded down in the back, and i probably could have stretched them out to fit until the specified 18 pounds, but as stated in other reviews, they are rather narrow (which is great for the smaller prefolds, but not so much for the bigger sizes).  i went ahead and ordered one size 2 duo to find out how well it fit.  these are much wider than the size 1 and fit the medium prefolds great, although i still have to fold them down in the back when the rise is on the smallest setting. i love thirsties for the extra leg gusset, we haven't had a poop explosion that this cover couldn't handle, even when the poop managed to get all the way around the prefold inside the cover!
These are just like the pacifiers hospitals use. So if your baby loved the hospital pacifiers but rejects the standard bulb shaped ones, this is definitely one you want to try. It is important to note that you must let the baby latch on to these just like you do with a nipple or else it will pop right back out (and may look like the baby is spitting it out). You can't just pop them in and expect them to stay like the bulb shaped ones. However once that latch is established I've found it is way more budge proof than the bulb shaped ones are.<br /><br />Another feature I really appreciate is that the handle is designed to sit flush against the base, making it less likely the baby will accidentally pull it out by the handle.<br /><br />The mouth piece is very soft and supple. The base is surrounded by a ring of silicone to increase comfort.<br /><br />My one week old newborn loves these (he loved the one he got at the hospital). He's had no issues with nipple confusion either. But that's also true of the standard bulb designs.
my two month old breastfed baby would not take any of the half dozen bottles i tried - including ones with natural nipples such as tommy tippee and avent. i researched and found these bottles and with three days to spare before i was to return to work we finally got the little guy to take a bottle. it was truly a miracle. these are not only shaped correctly, but they are more malleable as well, which we found was the problem with the other &#34;natural&#34; ones. my son is now four months old and a champ at using these bottles, so we thought we'd give the other ones a try again since we already owned them. the other ones are still a no-go, so i'm stocking up on more of these. i only have two tiny gripes - the cap is a little hard to snap into place and it's very hard to read the measurements on the side of the bottle. but these issues are insignificant because all that matters is he's actually able use these! if you are transitioning your breastfed baby to a bottle try these first. i am so incredibly thankful i found these.
NOTE: These are not big enough to cover entire windows, just a good amount. 13 x 20 sheets  These aren't window tinting, but they are. This is a staticly clung to your window Tint. I just got done installing this and have found that I could play with it seven hundred times to get it perfect, and it was still clinging to the window.   These come packed into a box the size of a cig pack. First thing, take them out and lay them flat in the sun, at night put a bunch of weight on top of them. I put these in the back windows and those were already tinted, and these just add to the darkness. They are easy to cut, easy to work, I used my hand a lot and a credit card. I had no problems, just went from one side to the other. I will update if I have any faults... but for now, Its a great item to cover light from the kids!  UPDATE: Today, Jan 2nd, they are still in place, holding strong. A few air bubbles showed up, but with fingers, they are taken out. Im going to buy another pack, I want to add to the back windows of my SUV.   Good Luck
I can't say enough good about this pacifier! I had planned on not using a pacifier with my daughter due to my firstborn's heavy attachment to his. However, she started wanting to nurse 24/7 a couple weeks after she was born, so I finally broke down and bought her a paci. It became clear very quickly that she wanted nothing to do with one. I tried multiple pacifiers and none of them were even remotely accepted by her. I was pretty beside myself about it and did a search to see what the most breast-like pacifier was and was led to this one. I placed my order right away, and as soon as it was delivered I opened it up, boiled it, and presented it to my daughter. She didn't care for it until she got a little upset later on, but then she took it right away! She definitely knows the difference between the pacifier and the breast, but she has accepted the pacifier as an &#34;okay&#34; substitute until boob becomes more convenient. Soooo, I strongly recommend that any breastfeeding mothers try this pacifier if you need a bit of a break!
i also didn't think a video monitor would be necessary, but my husband--a gadget guy--wanted one, so we 1st got the sight & sound assurance by safety 1st.  the monitor on the safety 1st was always b&w and pretty grainy, also the monitor is very bulky and always has to be plugged in.   <br /> <br />as soon as we plugged in this summer infant monitor we were both amazed at the picture quality.  it is very clear even at night and you can adjust the brightness of the picture to your liking.  it picks up sound extremely well too.  also--for those of you with a wireless network we have had no problems.  love that you can see the video with volume all the way down and that the video turns off after a few seconds (button on top turns it back on instantly) <br /> <br />only negative--a little bit of background static--my husband didn't notice it. <br /> <br />(btw--someone was complaining about the picture being b & w at night--every monitor system would be b & w at night, because there is no such thing as color in the absence of light!)
NUK Genius pacifiers are great! We had trouble finding a pacifier that our son would take without a problem and we tried many different ones before finally getting this one. Our son loves it and we have been using them since he was a few weeks old (we are now on size 2). The pacifier is softer than the regular NUK and is shaped in a way that leaves more space for the tongue. It is also very light and has two slits on the sides to allow more air flow. Yes, it's true that the baby can fit the whole thing in his mouth (my son did it once when he was about 5 months old) but there is absolutely no way that he would be able to swallow it. Plus the slits on the sides would not allow him to suffocate either (the air or saliva can still flow freely). The baby can get a little scared if it got stuck in his mouth but that's about it. And by the way, many other pacifiers out there would fit in baby's mouth as well, so there is no reason to deem this one more dangerous than others.    This pacifier is worth every penny and I highly recommend it.
i love this car seat, and so does my little one. it is easy to use, you can easily put in it your car or take it out. it is also light weighted so its not a problem to transfer it from car to car.<br />the only two things that were not perfect: the product description says you can use this seat from 22 pounds on. we started using it when my little one had around 22, maybe a bit more. but as she is not the tallest, she barely could see over the protection shield, not speaking of holding a bottle or maybe a snack box. when we went for a trip, one of the adults always had to drive in the back seat to give her drinks or snacks. so this was a little disadvantage. but if you are aware of this fact (as i were not when buying) you can take it into consideration.<br />the second thing is that -if i remember correctly- you cannot remove the fabric. so if your little ones spill their drinks, there is no way to wash the fabric and you may have stains in the fabric.<br />otherwise than these minor issues, i am absolutely happy with this product.
I had my son in July and 4 days after his birth we had to take him to the NICU because he had jaundice so bad.  While in the NICU the nurse asked us if he likes a pacifier.  I said I wasn't sure because we had given him one of those Nuk pacifiers and he spit it out and didn't like it.  She then order him the Red Dog Wubba Nub and he has been using it ever since! We liked them so much I ordered the Blue Horse for his diaper bag and got Green Frog for the downstairs in my house.  There is literally a Wubba Nub everywhere and We don't leave home with out it.  Kids love the plush animal and like the other reviewer stated it keeps the pacifier in the babies mouth.  The Wubba Nub for me has been a life safer cuz it has allowed me to give my son the pacifier without having to hold it ---so I can be off cleaning or doing other things and don't have to listen to a screaming baby.  They make a great gift too!!  Everywhere we go people are like what is that?  That is so cool?  I have never seen a pacifier like that.  Buy it you won't be sorry!!!
This toy has saved our car rides with my 6-month old! She would cry and cry, lose her nuk and her toys in her car seat. This offers a great distraction from being away from mom in the back seat. We use the Nuk pacifiers with the handles and they stay in securely. I also used the teether toys which are cute but heavy. I tried to do one teether toy and one nuk but the teether toy made one side too heavy and didn't work well. Either way she likes the teethers on their own. The materials used are soft and the toy itself seems of high quality. The cow design is so cute! My one concern might be that the pulley system have a bit more tension to avoid sliding while my daughter has the pacifier in her mouth. It is hardly a problem but I could see how it might be an issue if you had a younger, less strong baby to pull it down and keep it in her mouth. My pediatrician even thought the toy was a great idea at her last checkup! Baby girl loves this thing I it has really helped cease the screaming in the car. Great little toy and very useful for us!
we got mr. cow. or mr. moo. or mooie. he has been known by all three aliases. we bought these after my infant took so quickly to clutching her cousin's angel dear elephant (also totally precious) when she'd go down for a nap at her grandma's house and summer place. we soon learned that lovies, even at the young age of three months, were a bingo for getting our endless nurser off the boob in less time. we chose moo-cows because heck, it's vt. unlike giraffes, she's guaranteed to see a real one in her lifetime.<br /><br />it's soft, and lightweight, and easy to pack in a diaper bag, but also has some solidity in the head, and little nubby ears and corners of the blankie to suck on. she also likes to drape it over her face, as she gets older, when she's sleepy and seemingly wants to shut out the world. i love these things, and if you have a diaper bag that's constantly in use, or a caregiver that's not in your home, it's super helpful to have three - one that lives in the crib, one for her go-bag, and the constant 'in the wash' duplicate.
If I could I would give MAM bottles 10+ stars. It is my life saver and here is why:<br /><br />I have tried different shaped nipples but my son refused them all until MAM nipple.  I did tons of research for best bottle for breastfeeding babies.  I tried Dr. Brown, Lasinoh,  Tommee Tippee,  all of them have different nipple shapes but none worked for my son. If you pay attention to your nipple after breastfeeding,  it's kinda flat.  MAM is one of the very brands that offers flat and soft nipple. And my son took it right at the first time.  Woohoo!<br /><br />The size matters. It is big enough to clean easily (bigger than Dr. BROWN's) and not too big to fit in my mugs when I warm the bottle.  Tommee Tippee is too wide and short, kinda awkward and doesn't fit my mugs.<br /><br />Gas reduction: I could hear the air coming out from the holes at the bottom without fluid leaking . Genius design!<br /><br />Self sanitizer function: 3 mins in microwave and bum. ... it's done.<br /><br />Love love it. Highly recommend it for breastfeeding babies.
I love the way this little dragon looks, and it's always easy to find the baby's pacifier.  However, I do not feel that it helps our little guy keep the pacifier in his mouth at all.  He's only 2 months old and was a preemie, so he has difficulty holding onto a paci regardless.  The soothie and gumdrop pacifiers are the only ones recommended by lactation professionals for nursing babies, so I feel like if you have to use one of the soothies, why not have a cute one?  To wash the dragon, I've just used a damp cloth with some dish detergent and let him air dry.  It has worn just fine cleaning him with this method.  Just a reminder, the soothie is stitched to the dragon, so you cannot change out the pacifier, unless you feel comfortable sewing and are crafty.  I feel like for the money the dragon costs, I'd be too afraid to botch the job! Overall, I think it's an adorable novelty, but not incredibly useful.  We just appreciate it for being cute and the baby looks sweet with the little dragon laying on his chest, it looks like they're kissing.
This is a must have! We bought a bunch of different pacifiers but the bebe would only take the Soothie that she was given at the hospital. However, she was not able to keep it in her mouth so she kept losing it (and screaming). I was going insane! Then my saviour arriveD - the WubbaNub! Bebe loves it and I love it. Finally, I don't have to give her the paci every 5 seconds. It helps the baby keep the pacifier in her mouth and it's easy to find when it does fall out. The stuffed animal is adorable. It's our bebe's first friend. She absolutely loves it. I just wish I found out about it sooner (it was a looooonnnng couple of weeks without the WubbNub).<br /><br />We have the giraffe and the duck. The duck is cuter but the giraffe works better, in my opinion. It's a little bigger, so it's easier for the baby to hold and it does a better job at keeping the paci in baby's mouth.<br /><br />No matter which stuffed animal you pick, make sure you buy two WubbaNubs because when you have to wash it, it takes a while to dry. I've learned it the hard way!
this was purchased for us as a gift.  i thought that perhaps our twin boys were too young to play with this - wrong!  they were completely enamored with the moving lights from about three weeks old.  they're now nearly four months old, and they're still entertained.  i love the fact that you can hang it upside down.  we have a very basic play mat, and we hang the flower garden upside down from the arch - it's extremely secure.  they are now able to strike it themselves (usually with their feet) to get it to play the tunes.  when one strikes it and the melody plays, the other stops what he's doing to watch the show (even from across the room).  fantastic!  we've even come up with a little dance for them...dorky?  yes, but it makes them smile - and anything is worth those smiles!  oh, and the impact required to activate the flowers is far more sensitive than i thought it would have been.  my boys can lightly brush one of the flowers and the chimes/melodies play.  and the multiple textures and colors keep them staring.  love, love,love this toy!
My daughter only uses a binky to sleep or calm herself since birth (and now still at 6mos).  She was always dropping them and we had to put one back in her hand or mouth, constantly!  We tried straps too which helped us find the binky but was no use for her.  We also didn鈥檛 want to put her in the crib with anything with straps/clips on it to avoid various hazards there.  Then we found the wubbanub and it has exceeded our expectations.  With the wubbanub she can find and grab the body without our intervention and she loves the characters.  We have the giraffe and frog and she loves looking at the faces and then puts the pacifier, head or one of the legs in her mouth (sometimes all at the same time).  We wash it regularly and don't leave the house without it.  We have lots of cute photos too with an animal hanging out of her mouth :-)  Only improvement would be to offer a version with replaceable binkies or at least an option for the 3+ month stronger plastic.  We鈥檝e had both for 4 months and no visible wear and bodies are still solidly stitched.
i received this pillow right on time for my baby girl. we were recently told by her doctor to have her propped up a little to help with her reflux but at the same time she has allergies so the pillows we have will not work for her. so when i got the chance to purchase this pillow during a promotion i was thrilled as i was in the market for a soft, cozy yet not make her allergies flare up.  we used this pillow last night after removing the tags and throwing it in the dryer for a little bit. the tags were easily removed and didn't cause any rips or other damages. my daughter loves her pillow and held on to it since i hand it to her--she keeps squeezing it to watch it puff right back up. my baby slept like a baby with this slumberlux pillow -- or should i say she slept like a husband.  this will clean easily as the material on the outside you can just wipe it off. liquids will not be able to penetrate either which is a big plus with kids i was able to buy this pillow at a promotional rate and all views and opinions expressed here are 100% of my own.
earths answer 100% natural wool dryer balls, jumbo size, largest currently available (4).<br /><br />the dryer balls by earths answer are well made and extra large! i normally use three to four smaller plastic balls for normal size load, but i have used all 4 balls, but i have only found it necessary to use two of these with a normal load, but it is nice to use 4 with the towels and sheets. they just come out so soft. i have used them several times and they have held up well, and my clothes are dryer in a lot less time. i was skeptical as i have issues with wool, but these balls are strong and have held up to the dryer.<br /><br />i have tried other style and types of dryer balls. and they were good, but i have never had anything like these and i sure hope the last a long long time. because they are just super and when it comes to saving money that is always a major plus.<br /><br /> i received this product at a savings price or it is supplied to me for the purposes of a product review. all opinions are 100% my own and they reflect my honest & unbiased opinion.
since the baby just started sleeping in the crib i cannot talk about long term but the mattress fit nice and snug in the crib and is easy to lift out to change sheets, which fit nicely form the get go. there is ample support along the edges for when the baby is going to be standing there and the mattress is easy to clean any wetness or other messes off should they occur. my son seems very comfortable when lying on the mattress. i can't comment on firmness for my son since he barely puts a dent in a pile of cotton when on it but the mattress seems nice and firm to my test. i think for the price it is a great bargain. at the very least you will get a few good years while your child is still growing and putting on weight. i know we want to buy for the long term but to be honest, will we really keep this over 3-4 years? from what i have seen thus far, looks like a great product.<br /><br />i am changing the rating from a four star to five as the mattress has been a perfect fit and must be comfortable as the baby sleeps endlessly on it. very happy with this purchase.
We love this thing!!! First of all...it's adoreable!!!! We have the elephant one - so cute! My son is a wiggler as well, and this helps him coordinate the paci back in his mouth when he knocks it out. I'm a little grosses out by how often he puts the legs and ears in his mouth knowing that it's fallen on the ground more times than I can count - but just read that it's machine washable, so I'm thrilled to pieces!!! I'll definitely be tossing that bad boy in the wash ASAP!!!! :). Great product! Well made! My son wasn't crazy about pacis in general in the beginning, but we just kept this one around (as well as a soothie without the elephant attached) and he's come around (especially now that he's teething!)<br /><br />As for the &#34;I could make this myself&#34;ers... You absolutely could. But by the time you buy the $3 soothie, the $4 plush stuffed animal and figure out whether you should hot glue or sew it... I say just splurge a little. You don't need more than one. Unless you're super crafty and you have everything lying around anyway, we'll then go for it! ;)
i got this today. my baby isn't here yet, but so far i am really happy with this bassinet. it was easy enough to set up and looks like it will be perfect for next to the bed. i plan to use the cover to make sure my cat doesn't try to jump in, but i think it will also be great for the summer, if we ever want to just sit out on the porch or take a trip to the park. the pad that comes with this is not terribly thick, but i think it is perfectly fine for a baby. i ordered a bassinet mattress to go with this but i don't think i'll keep it and will send it back. the one that comes with it recommends not to use additional padding as it could be unsafe if it does not fit properly or is too soft. i'd rather be safe and just use the one that comes with it. i really don't think she's going to be spending the majority of her time in there anyway.<br />overall so far, i'm happy with this purchase. the color is what i expected and could be used for a boy or girl. the quality is good, and the product is pretty much what i was expecting. if anything changes, i'll update my review.
I was hesitant to give my newborn a pacifier at all, but around 4 weeks, she became insistant that she have something to suck on as she fell asleep. I was nursing her to sleep, but it came to point that after I'd try to slip away she'd immediately wake up rooting for something to suck.<br /><br />I bought several [[ASIN:B004IOHN8Q The First Years 2 Pack GumDrop Infant Pacifier, Pink/Purple]] (soothies), but she was never happy with them. When I tried to slip the pacifier in place of my breast after she was asleep, she'd immediately stir & fuss.<br /><br />I bought the Natursutten pacifier because I loved that it's all natural, BPA/PVC/Phthalates-free! I was skeptical that my little girl would take any brand, but this one has worked wonders. The pacifier is large enough that it rests against her nose just like my breast. I'm able to slip away after she's done nursing & slip in this pacifier without a problem.<br /><br />I should note that my little girl has had trouble figuring out how to suck a pacifier but this one she took to very quickly. We are both very happy!
After having a C-section, I was concerned how I was going to handle running up and down stairs to accomodate our newborn daughters sleeping/changing needs.   <br /> <br />We decided to set up the Colby pack and play downstairs and have not moved it since (our daughter is 3 months old).   She loves taking naps in this and it is convenient when I am doing things on the first floor.  The changing station is wonderful and has made our lives so much easier.  We no longer have to stop what we're doing and run up stairs for every diaper change.   <br /> <br />Must admit- the music (sounds) and vibration option are rather gimmicky.  We never use these features.  Also, we took it upon ourselves to add our own mobile on the side of the unit- this provides added entertainment for our daughter while we are busy making dinner or fixing her bottle.  <br /> <br />Though she will be nearing the weight limit soon for the changing unit and bassinet features, we plan to leave it in our living room.  It has truly helped us out and I would definitely put on my top 5 list!! <br /> <br />
i just received the unit, and can't speak to the long term reliabiltiy, but i am most impressed with the quality of the video, audo, range and features. its two way communication allow the parent to remotely turn on different functions in the camera..like music, night light.  the one feature that had me going was a rotary switch on the camera which sets the sensitivity for an alarm in the monitor whenever the sound threshold in the baby's room is exceeded.  it was set for maximum sensitivity and the alarm was reporting continuously.  took me a while to find out what the cause was.  a couple downsides to the system.. if the noise threshold sensitivity level is set high (so you can hear a pin drop in the baby's room, the the alarm will go off when you remotely switch on the music.  also, the camera has a room temperature monitor, but it is mounted so close to the camera, that it reflects more the camera temp than the room's.  so it reads about 10 degrees warmer on the monitor and is virtually useless.  (not a deal breaker though). overall it seems like a great system..
These are the BEST bottle out there for our baby.  This is the only nipple shape our daughter will take.  I was surprised that there are NO other bottles with this nipple shape.  I like the venting feature of these bottles and I like that there aren't too many pieces to clean (like the Dr. Brown's bottles I used for our first daughter - what a nightmare to clean!).  These bottles only have 3 large pieces to each bottle (in addition to the nipple and ring).  It does not require any kind of special cleaning brush.<br /><br />They vent wonderfully.  I like that you get two different sized bottles AND two pacifiers.  For $20, you can't go wrong with this gift set.  To buy each piece individually at the store would cost about $30.<br /><br />You do have to be careful with the temperature of your milk/formula.  If it's too hot, these bottles WILL leak.  Also, since these bottles are very thick, it takes a long time to warm up contents inside the bottle.  I prefer to warm up milk or formula in a breast milk storage bottle and then dump it into the MAM bottle when it's warm.
i bought this product (admittedly from a different website because i found it cheaper).  i got it in the green color & it is adorable.  a lot of reviewers said it was big but it was actually smaller than i had pictured it.  i have an 18 month old & a 4 year old (& my 4 year old is skinny) & i do think that it's barely big enough for 2 kids.  my kids have not tried to sit back in it like lots of other reviewers stated so falling out hasn't been an issue.  i did get the easel & it's on one side.  they love playing with it when they aren't using the learning tower to help me in the kitchen.  the easel has a chalk board on one side & a dry erase board on the other side, so you can flip it whenever you want.  both sides are magnetic as well & it comes with a large magnetic bar to hold a piece of paper for coloring, drawing, etc.  all in all, i am very happy with this.  i've wanted one for a while & waited so long because of the price.  but, it's very sturdy & i believe the price is well worth it.  i'm considering buying another easel so they can each have their own as well.
this necklace looks like a piece of jewelry! it has a really nice color to it, and can be worn by either a boy or a girl. i really like that it鈥檚 all-natural, with no dyes or pharmaceuticals added 鈥?kids could chew for hours and not ingest anything unsafe. the material and construction feels very high quality 鈥?when you pull at the string, you'll feel that ths necklace won鈥檛 break, no matter how hard an overly eager baby may pull at it! this also means that the necklace presents less of a safety concern, since it seems impossible for the beads to be pulled apart and swallowed by accident. the beads themselves are genuine amber, and also feel very durable, and will withstand really strong, forceful bites. teething children will have a great time, and parents will feel confident that their children will be using a safe product. overall, this is a great alternative to other teething products out there. not only is this necklace all-natural, but it also has immune system-boosting properties and actually helps children feel better through the teething process. great product!
i do not currently own the product, but after researching the negative feedback category i will probably purchase it.  a helpful article was this one that is available on pubmed.  [...].  being a doctor myself it was easy for me to follow, however, it may not be suitable for some without a background of health or medicine.  from my point of view it appears that owners are more vigilant in monitoring for torticollis and that cases are caught earlier rather than being caused by the sleeper, itself.  in regards to flattening of the skull (aka deformational plagiocephaly), it is a relatively common condition in societies that put their babies to sleep on their backs.  i, myself, have a flat back on my skull, and no one even knows it is there as it is covered by hair.  i can imagine, however, that in severe cases that a medical skull reforming helmet would be necessary for aesthetic purposes.  just my two cents.  hopefully, some of those researching the item can find this article helpful.  the five stars are only what i expect it to be.  will update as i get experience with it.
I purchased this for our Nuby Soothie pacifiers. I read the reviews and was a bit concerned with many reviews saying that it was very difficult to open, some saying impossible. I was concerned as I have Fibromyalgia and can hardly open jars, heavy doors and other things with my hands. I took the chance and bought one, hey it was only $3.99 with free shipping! When I received the case I immediately went to open it with the provided latch and yes it was difficult but I found a more than easier way to open the case. If you squeeze the two sides of the case, it instantly pops open. I barely have to put pressure on the case and its quickly open. Yes, I realize the latch should be easy to open but I found this way worked and seems to be a great way. This easily fits two soothie pacifiers in the case. The clip is a little flimsy but I believe it's made that way so you can clip it on nearly anywhere. I think an improvement would be an actual caribeanner clip to ensure it doesn't fall off. Although I have not had the problem of it falling off. It's so wonderful I purchased another one!
These pacifiers have proven to be lifesavers. We have multiples, and once your baby loves them you'll be buying multiples too! We have used these since leaving the hospital, and therefore avoided baby waking up in the middle of the night due to losing her pacifier. They stay in because the stuffed animal helps them stay close to their mouth instead of falling out as soon as they stop sucking. As they get older, the stuffed animal serves as a comfort toy, full of texture and appendages to pull. Sometimes baby sucks and chews on everything but the pacifier! They also are easy to wash. We wash the pacifier in the sink, keeping the plush out of the water for quick cleans. Then, when a deep clean is needed (after all that chewing) we wash the whole thing in a delicate laundry bag in the washing machine with her baby clothes. This is why I recommend more than one, so you can wash one and have a back up for baby. The elephant was great due to the big ears, she loves to pull on those. We constantly have other parents asking about this pacifier....once you have one you'll be a believer.
i have had this pillow for months now, so i feel i can give an informed review.  it took about a week to get used to sleeping with it and to break in the part where my head goes, but since then i have been more than happy with it -- in fact, i had my baby over a month ago and i still use it and find it incredibly comfortable.  the best part while i was pregnant was that i slept more soundly with the pillow so i didn't wake up to go to the bathroom as many times during the night, so i actually felt well-rested in the morning.  the best part now that the baby is born is that i can fold it in half in the middle of the night when the baby wakes up and it becomes a backrest for nursing - very comfortable and much better than just leaning against a regular pillow because it has \\arms\\ for more support.  one thing though:  the jersey knit cover is very comfortable and fits the pillow perfectly, but the regular cotton cover is not soft at all and it doesn't fit properly around that curved area at the top so it ends up digging into your neck/shoulder area.  stick with the jersey cover.
my husband and i are both musicians and love this toy for our children! when my 5 year old was about 6mo old, we found this toy at a local general store, and picked it up for her for only $10. she would crawl all over the place scooting (more like scratching, but who's counting lol) it on the floor, and when the music would stop, she'd start it again and keep going. when she got older, she liked to take it with her to listen to music, and played the music every night until she was about 2. then we got her a cd player and she only played with this one about 2 or 3 times per week. when we found out i was pregnant with baby number 2, she offered to give her brother her favorite baby toy (it was sweet!). sadly, the baby dropped it off the table (it had been dropped and thrown more times than i can possibly count), and we had to replace it. i love the design of the new circle. it's easier to push and more attractive for a baby's eye. plus the rings around the handle adds to an already great toy and makes it awesome! i have recommended it to many many people, and will continue to do so!
this is the best baby product we have.  the thing has fit onto every single table we've tried it on--our own dining room table, where it usually sits (saves space), restaurant tables, kitchen islands, and the tables at her grandparents' houses.  best part is that now that baby is 9 months and feeding herself (and making incredible messes), we can take it apart and throw the cover in the washing machine.  the nylon air dries super quickly.  it's incredibly sturdy, and took most of my body weight on the back of it when i leaned on it to check it before we put the baby in it.  i love this thing.  great product, super convenient, beautiful to look at, so it's really about both form and function.  a fantastic product that i've already bought for other friends' having babies.  folds up in a jiffy and fits right into the attached carrying bag, so i don't have to go hunting for the bag or fear losing it every time we take it out with us.  this thing is incredible.  the tray fits great and washes fast, too.  what a fabulous product.  literally the best designed baby product i've ever used.
we originally purchased the inglesina fast chair but i was frustrated with the fact that it had no tray and there was a gap between the chair and table. after having multiple gel mats flung to the floor and food shoved into the gap and onto the floor i purchased the lobster chair. i have used it for three days (we use it in lieu of a stand alone high chair) and am satisfied with how easily it attached and the tray. no more dents in my table from slammed bottles and no more flying mats. hooray! several people complained how easily the tray slides out. i have not found this to be a problem. in the future if little one decides shoving it forward is fun i will slip a piece of non-slip matting under the tray. the bucket seat is a little deep in order to accompany kids of all sizes. my little one is on the small size so i folded a towel and put it in the seat to boost him up a bit. eventually i will not need the towel. over all i am satisfied with this chair. it packs up compactly, is easier and less bulky than the inglesina, has a tray and sits little one closer to the table. win, win.
i was planning my daughter's baby shower (our first grandchild) and had ordered a honey favor from another company online.  it was about a week before the shower was to take place and i realized that the items had not arrived, now approx. three weeks late.  i tried to contact the company several times but was never able to get any response online or by phone ( i immediately went to my bank of course to cancel the charges from this obvious scam).  in a panic i began to search the internet for another company that stocked a similar honey favor.  what a blessing when i found the holy honey company!  i called the telephone number listed and much to my amazement i not only got to speak with a real person but it was the owner of the company.  she was amazing, helpful, kind,  considerate, and assured me that i would receive the product in time for our baby shower.  we received the items days before the shower, they were beautiful and all of our guests loved this unique little gift and of course the tasty honey.  god bless you holy honey for being so wonderful and &#34;saving the day.&#34;
my girlfriend, tammy, and i have been babysitting her grandniece, claire, for months.  we've fed her using an entire \\family\\ of philips avent classic plus bottles.  claire loves them because of the modern technology employed in the design of the nipple.  a valve built into the nipple has been designed to expel excess air back into the bottle rather than the baby's tummy; the valve also works with the baby to allow him/her to regulate the flow of the liquid.  therefore, the valve prevents choking.<br /><br />  claire is a much happier baby at meal time.  she seldom cries when we feed her.  at the baby shower thrown for claire's mom, theresa, a multitude of different bottles were unwrapped.  of all the bottles tammy and i have used, the philips avent classic plus baby bottles are the best.  they are extremely easy for us to clean because of fewer parts and larger openings.  most importantly, claire loves them.  she has graduated from the four ounce to the nine ounce bottles, and now she uses the eleven ounce bottles.  the eleven ounce bottles function just like the smaller versions.
My son is fed via a combination of breastfeeding and pumped milk. We've tried A LOT of bottles and he prefers the MAMs over everything else. For him, the nipples on Dr. Browns and Born free are too long. He hated the Avent Naturals because he had to smoosh his face into them to get a full latch. He is OK with Nuks but he prefers the MAMs. I think that the shape of the nipple just really works for him. It is wider and flatter than most bottle nipples. They say it mimics the breast - that isn't our issue as I use a nipple shield. He also seems to have less gas, due to the venting system. That all said, it is true that these can leak from the base if you don't assemble them correctly. It has happened to me, I know now to double check the base before I pour milk in. In addition, the venting system in designed in such a way that if you heat up milk directly in these by putting a bottle in warm water, you'll get water in the underside that will drip out when feeding. Since the plastic is fairly thick on these, I just heat up the milk in a Medela bottle and transfer to one of these to feed.
Before my baby was born, I had read favorable reviews about the Wubbanub pacifiers, and so I registered for them, thinking they would be nice to have.  Well, now that I have them, I cannot imagine life with out them!  Not only do they use my son's favorite brand of pacifier, the Soothie, which most hospitals use, but the lightweight attached toy is of great benefit by helping the pacifier stay in place!  When my son accidentally spits out the pacifier, instead of it bouncing off of him to who-knows-where, it stays in practically the same spot, just below his chin, provided he does not knock the stuffed animal out of the way.  I like this system better than any pacifier clips I've used because with the clips, he'll spit out the pacifier, and although it is still attached to him, it will likely drop to his side and far from his mouth.  With the Wubbanubs, the pacifier stays nearby more often than not, and any parent who has ever used a pacifier knows that that is a great thing!!!  These are definitely worth the money, and be sure to get at least one for the diaper bag and one for home!
this car seat is absolutely perfect for my 10 month old daughter!! we had to upgrade from the chicco keyfit 30 due to a car accident.  in order to leave the hospital, my husband and i had to go get a new car seat.  we went to the nearest babies 'r' us while my daughter was still admitted, and purchased a safety first similar model, and loved the look of it.  however, when my daughter would fall asleep in it, her head would fall forward every time, looking so uncomfortable, and that couldn't have been good for her developing neck!! so, i returned it and did my research on amazon and decided to spend the money on this seat.  i am so happy with the purchase! the print is beautiful, even more vibrant in person and is a soft, velour type material.  it is relatively easy to install, depending on whether you use the anchors and their position in your car.  its not too heavy, and my daughter is so snuggled and comfortable in it, she falls asleep almost immediately making for a much happier car ride for my family!! i would definitely recommend this, and will purchase it for my future children.
I purchased this product after using the Phillips Avent Soothie Pacifiers for my little daughter. They are the only pacifiers she has ever taken. It's also the kind they gave her while she was in the NICU at the hospital. I am so glad someone came up with this idea!<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. Cute pink animal for girls!<br />2. Easy to keep track of - easy to see in a dark bedroom at night & also when you are holding the baby, they are much easier to grab as they are falling than a Paci alone<br />3. Stays in better than a Soothie Paci by itself - we often prop the animal on her chest and she seems to love holding on to the soft stuffed animal & can even sometimes push it back into her own mouth (and she's only 10 weeks!)<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. Tedious cleaning - I usually wash them on gentle in the washing machine but worry about my daughter ingesting detergent residue so I usually then wash off the pacifier top with a pacifier wipe<br />2. Falls out - not as much as when it's only the pacifier - could just be my daughters tongue pushing it out or something but I think worth mentioning
I ordered the Cutsie Caterpillar wubbanub for my daughter with hopes it would help keep the soothie in her mouth for longer than 2 seconds - and it did!! At 6-weeks old, she was able to wrap her arm around her bug, which helped keep the soothie in her mouth. This meant longer spurts of sleeping for her and me. She's now 5-months old and absolutely loves her bug. She's never far from it and can put it in her mouth all by herself. She'd be devastated if anything happened to it, so just ordered another one for back-up.<br /><br />At first I was concerned about keeping the plush part clean since it doesn't separate from the soothie, but it's a non-issue. The wubbanub washes very easily in the washing machine and air dries quickly. I just zip it inside a boppy slipcover before putting it in the wash so it doesn't get beat up by the machine.<br /><br />I highly recommend this for any parent who is frustrated when their baby's soothie keeps falling out of their mouth. Not only did it help our daughter keep it in her mouth, it gave her something to bond with as she falls asleep or needs comfort.

It's also the kind they gave her while she was in the NICU at the hospital. I am so glad someone came up with this idea!<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. Cute animals for boys & girls!<br />2. Easy to keep track of - easy to see in a dark bedroom at night & also when you are holding the baby, they are much easier to grab as they are falling than a Paci alone<br />3. Stays in better than a Soothie Paci by itself - we often prop the animal on her chest and she seems to love holding on to the soft stuffed animal & can even sometimes push it back into her own mouth (and she's only 10 weeks!)<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. Tedious cleaning - I usually wash them on gentle in the washing machine but worry about my daughter ingesting detergent residue so I usually then wash off the pacifier top with a pacifier wipe<br />2. Falls out - not as much as when it's only the pacifier - could just be my daughters tongue pushing it out or something but I think worth mentioning
In true breastfeeding fashion, we waited until our son was four weeks old before offering any pacifiers to make sure we had good attachment and technique down (don't really believe in nipple confusion, but it helps everyone involved not to be stuffing a newborn's mouth with a pacifier from day one).  One we passed that magic milestone of four weeks, we opened our new Wubbanub and a fast appreciation was had--babies love to suckle!  It calms them and allows them to gather themselves in the middle of a meltdown.  It is great to carry them through to the next feeding when they get older if you are trying to sleep train.  My son falls asleep within minutes when I put him down in his crib, awake with the Wubbanub--he always spits it out after he is asleep, but no need to restuff his mouth.  The little monkey legs and arms lay on the chest and help the pacifier stay put.  He also loves to grab it with his hands and arms in a big hug.  Our other pacifiers have laid useless in the diaper bag ever since we started using this one--would not have bought any other if I had know the power of the Wubba!
this toy is by far the best toy in the toy arsenal. it works as a distraction tool, as a movement motivator, as a cootie shot soother, as a teether, and so much more. this is one of the first toys i opened for the wee man and even though he didn't really know what to do with it right away, he loved it, probably because it's so colorful and noisy. now he discovers something new to do with this every day; it's also been motivating him to scoot and roll in all directions. his older cousins love it as well; i only wish i could find it in a local store so i could get it for them - i guess this toy will also prove helpful in teaching sharing. i got this as a gift, but i'm seeing that it isn't expensive, especially since it'll be an all-time favorite for a long time (all cousins, from a few months to two years love love love this thing), so it makes a great gift for someone else or your own baby. it's easy to clean, links to the stroller easily for road trips, won't get gross in the tub at bath time, and it won't be easily lost. awesome toy. love this and the person who gave it to him. get this!!!!
our son has always been a good sleeper. he would wake up to feed throughout the night and then go right back to sleep. he loved being swaddled, and as time went on he slept better and better. he would average 5-8 hours before waking up to feed. i was very nervous about not swaddling him anymore, and wanted to try to transition him out of yhe swaddle before he began to roll over. at about 14 weeks i started to try different methods of putting him to sleep without swaddling him. i tried a sleep sac, keeping his arms out of the swaddle, one arm at a time, it was no use. i asked about what i could do on a group i'm in on facebook, and this product was recommended to me. i was skeptical at first, and the material looked very warm. i used the merlins magic sleep suit with a lighter sleeper and it was pretty much a seemless transition. he didn't get overheated in it, and he has access to his hands now. this product is great! i've been using it for 2 weeks now, and he's sleeping ever better than when he was swaddled! i highly recommend it for those who are looking for a good transition from being swaddled.
i purchased 5 britax roundabouts 5 years ago!  i am now ordering 5 more for my nissan armada.  i am a childcare provider and we are fairly mobile.  always on the go to the library, bookstore, playgrounds, etc., and i relied on parents carseats for a while.  some were hard to install, many smelled and were filthy.  finally i did a little research and discovered britax car seats and the loyal following from many many parents, grandparents and care givers!  that many satisfied customers can't be wrong.  so, i purchased 5, and installed them in just a few minutes!  who knew!  i am pleased with the roundabouts because they are small enough to allow 3 across and in my opinion they were super easy to install.  love the fact that you don't have to uninstall each carseat to adjust the shoulder straps (kids grow fast).  the kids love them and now its time to buy 5 more to replace my aging fleet of 2008 roundabouts.<br /><br />i will always use britax!  there is nothing on the market like them and i really appreciate having one less thing to worry about when i venture out with 5 children under the age of 5. :)
the blankets are super cute. i got the ecru color scheme; there are several pattern choices and they are all adorable. the blankets are soft to the touch, not too thin but also not thick and rigid. i haven't used them yet (due in a few weeks) but already washed them. they kept their shape very well after one wash/dry cycle (i will update if they loose the shape later on) as opposed to the just born flannel receiving blankets which i also purchased at the same time. in retrospect, i wish i just got two sets of the carter's blankets.  five months later: my baby is 4 months now and those blankets are our favorite. they still look very cute even though the colors faded just a bit.  they keep the shape nicely though. i use those mostly to cover my son on days when it's warm in the house; they are perfect to keep him warm but not hot. i also use them to cover him during night feedings. my mom usually places this blanket under the baby when she rocks him to sleep. she puts him down in his crib with the blanket so that the blanket touches the cold sheets of the crib. this minimizes the chance of him waking up.
My daughter ADORES her monkey wubbanub. She asks for it by name. She has a special laugh for it. If I would allow her to have it 24-7, it would only leave her mouth long enough for her to eat.<br /><br />However, I am concerned about the wubbanub monkey being a bad influence. We were travelling through an airport and as my daughter and I were getting ready to walk through the metal detector, a TSA agent informed me that she needed to x-ray and inspect the wubbanub monkey. I was initially surprised because wubbanub monkey has always been a faithful, comforting friend. He would never harm anyone. But apparently, the wubbanub monkey is the new face of terrorism. He looks sweet and innocent, but I guess those are the ones who look really suspicious. After trying to explain to my daughter why they were taking her monkey away, the wubbanub monkey was placed in a bowl, given a visual inspection, and run separately though the x-ray machine. My daughter still loves her monkey, but I can't look at him the same anymore. I hope that by giving him lots of love, we can deter him from his path of potential terrorism.
Like so many people said before me in their reviews, this pacifier stuffed animal combo is genius. Why didn't I think of something like this! The pacifier is the perfect size for and young infants maybe up to six or eight months old, not too much older than that. It is firmly, I mean firmly attached to the stuffed animal. The little stuffed animal reminds me of little beanie babies, but smaller and a little lighter.<br /><br />My grandson is only three months old and he was a preemie, but when he got his little hands on this pacifier combo, he would not let go. His mother and father were so surprised to see him actually reach for this little pacifier and put it in his mouth himself. He wont let ho of it. They love it too because they don't have to worry about him spitting it out or dropping the pacifier to the floor so much. The weight of the little stuffed animal, even though it is really light, does keep the pacifier near or on the baby when he lets go. The little animal is not so big that it would be too much weight on his chest or cause worry of it occluding his breathing. It's just the right size.

Pacifiers!  A baby's best friend!  (Not all babies...my daughter couldn't stand them.)  Like food, clothes, and cars, binkies (aka pacifiers) are a very personal item for a baby.  I know some parents buy a binky only to have their little one spit it out at them.  They then buy another one and the baby loves it!<br /><br />These particular binkies aren't heavy and are geared toward newborns and up.  They're pretty small for little mouths so sucking shouldn't be an issue.  Parents can hold the pinkie in to help the baby get used to it.<br /><br />Fortunately, they're BPA-free and can be washed in the dishwasher.  Personally, I would rather wash it by hand like I did with bottles.<br /><br />Will your baby like these?  It's hard to tell.  Babies are very picky about their binkies.  The only thing you can do is buy the set and try them out.  Amazon doesn't charge too much so testing them out won't break you.  Hopefully your baby will like them and, if he/she does, get more of them!<br /><br />Did I mention the colors?  I like that they are in the &#34;neutral zone&#34; so they can be used for boys and girls.
we bought this to replace the flimsy old pad that came with our used changing table. we were sure to measure it before ordering, since changing pads come in various sizes. this fits the table perfectly, and i love that this is the nicest one we found here on amazon. many of the others looked flimsy & not as durable as this one. they all seemed to be very thin in the middle, unlike this one. i also love that this particular pad doesn't dip way down in the middle like all of the others, it's just a nice gradual indentation. i also like that it has the belt to ensure that baby won't fall. the only thing i didn't like about this was the stinky smell of chemicals that the bag it came in had. the pad itself smelled a tiny bit like that, but once i had it out of the bag and allowed it to air out for a few days, that was no longer an issue. i would suggest doing that either before baby arrives, or allowing it to air out for a few days before using it at the very least, so that baby doesn't come into contact with the chemical smell. overall a very great changing pad, and the nicest one we could find here on amazon.
bought this for my son's nursery, and i'm very happy with the purchase. the quality of the paper, and the print is very high. to install it, all i had to do was soak it for a few seconds in water, take it in the bedroom, and press it into place where i wanted it. i do recommend having a helper with this, because it made it made it much easier to put into place with help to support it's weight. after it was in place, i only had to wipe it over a few times with a wet rag to smooth out the bumps.<br /><br />though i've painted, hung drywall, and done alot of dyi projects over the years, this was my 1st time ever attempting wall border. it was really no problem at all, as long as you have a little bit of common sense. everyone who has come to my house and seen the nursery has really complimented the character this border added. it's a little pricey at $17 per roll ( i needed 3) but it's well worth it for my son, and with the quality, i know this border is going to stay right where it is and look good until i decide it's time to take it back again someday.<br /><br />overall, worth the money and work to install.
my husband talked me into getting this pump after my electric one wasn't cutting it. i finally gave in after reading the amazing reviews on it. i am so glad i got this pump. here's why;<br />this pump is so much quieter. with the electric one i couldn't even watch tv while i pumped, it was so loud. some of the reviews talked about this pump squeaking... that is nothing compared to the noise my electric pump makes.<br />this pump is so much faster than the electric and i love that i can control the length of the \\pull\\ on me. it works the best if i compress the handle for 2-3 seconds before releasing. this allows me to pump in about half the time<br />if you are contemplating a manual pump just give this one a try, it works so much better than i thought it would and it doesn't tire out my hands as i thought it would.<br />please know i only pump twice a day,in the morning because he only nurses on one side then and i pump for his last feeding of the night so he can get a good feeding in and so my husband can get in on the feeding action; so i'm not sure how well it would work if you need to pump all the time.
i have a very deep, long, straight-sided fiberglass jetted bathtub which is not easy to climb out of.  i bought this handle to use as a balance point rather than something to carry my weight.  as with many similar tubs, each side has a wider, flat section and this 11.5 inch bar fits perfectly.  it is the same color as the tub and blends right in.  i do test it to be sure it is firmly attached before using it, but i am amazed at how powerful the suction is - there is no way i could remove this bar from the tub surface without releasing the two catches. it has been the perfect solution for me.<br /><br />i bought my first 11.5 inch safer grip in 2009 -  it  is still attached to my tub and cannot be pulled free.  i test it regularly, but the original suction (which is now 4 years old) still holds.  i'm so happy with it that i've ordered a couple more for tubs and tile showers at my house and at my mother's. it sticks as well to my tiled shower walls as it has to the tub. please note this review is for the 11.5 inch version only.  i was disappointed in the larger 16-17 inch size which did not adhere well to my tile.
i use diapers to clean my house. they do not leave any lint behind and they are great for cleaning windows, mirrors. no streaks are left behind. they leave a great shine on my furniture, glass table tops, and my bathrooms. i was them first before using them when i first purchase them. i only use degtergent and bleach. no fabric softener. i rewash them after each use the same way. if you use fabric softener, they will not absorb. i just use luandry degtergent and bleach and wash them in hot water. they sure save on other cleaning cloths due to you can use these diapers over and over again until they are worn out. it takes years for them to wear out. it is worth the price and i am happy i was able to find more. where i usually purchase the cloth diapters, they do not sell them anymore. they are also great for waxing your vehicle. after you give your vehicle a wash, just take a clean diaper and wipe it down to dry it off and does not leave any scratches or streaks. best to use in the shade. same when waxing your vehicle. your vehicle will shine and sparkle and make it look brand new. no lint left behind or streaks.
we loved using the city mini bassinet for our baby and got so much use out of it. we started using it as soon as we got home from the hospital, and took her for many walks in it. it is padded with foam and our baby slept very comfortably in there during walks. it easily disconnects from the stroller base, and is not too heavy. i used bassinet sheets to line it, they fit perfectly and made it easy to clean. the mosquito net that it comes with was also excellent for blocking out sun and anything from blowing into the bassinet. we used it until she was about 3 1/2 months old...because she was so tall and grew out of it. i would have kept using it otherwise.     the only issues i had with the city mini bassinet are 1. the price--however, we were lucky enough to find a gently used one on craigslist that was in perfect condition, for half the price....i definitely recommend doing this. and 2. the hood is sometimes a little tricky to put down because you have to press both buttons down simultaneously...while also pushing down the canopy, which is hard to do....i figured out a system that worked, so it wasn't a big deal.
for all moms who suffer with this type of problem, i understand that any experience to alleviate the pain of our little ones to be valid.<br />amber is a traditional and natural remedy used in europe for centuries, prized for its anti-inflammatory, healing and immune-stimulating analgesic properties.<br />today, the amber necklace is used worldwide to relieve the symptoms associated with baby's teething pain, fever, swelling of the gums, red cheeks, ear infections, rashes, sleep problems and restlessness.<br />besides of teething, the amber necklace can have a positive effect on allergies, eczema, rashes, cramps, respiratory diseases and improves sleep and immunity.<br />i was a bit concerned with the beads, but the use of amber necklace should be done under adult supervision, as the baby should never be alone when wearing it. try to wear on the ankle with a sock covering it, so it could be a lot safer.<br />with basic precautions, you will achieve more success with the amber necklace too. remember that we are talking about our baby and even with this little help from mother nature, it is important to keep safety first!
My husband and I recently purchased two sets of these blankets to supplement the various store brands that we own. These receiving blankets are superior to all the other brands we own.<br /><br />They are larger than brands bought from Kohls and Wal-mart. They are a solid 30 x 40 inches which is more than adequate for wrapping up a small infant. None of the other brands came close to this size and they drew up substantially in the wash on the first washing. Not so with these Carter blankets. They can handle multiple washings with little shrinkage.<br /><br />I don't know about you but receiving blankets take some abuse here. When you have a newborn, I've found that anything will do in a pinch...so receiving blankets get put through the ringer as towels and burp cloths, etc. These blankets seem well equipped for the job. Overall, they are of great quality.<br /><br />They are pretty shades of 100% cotton flannel in mixed prints of brown and pink. They are soft on baby's skin.<br /><br />I am happy to have bought these in two sets. They are a little hard to find online sometimes and I wish I had bought a couple more sets.
i was startled when i pulled this out of the box because it was so much bigger than i thought it would be.  i saw the pictures other people posted of their babies using this in the sink, and figured i could do the same.  i was completely wrong -- it's way too big for that.  i guess some people have really huge sinks!  so i was initially disappointed that i had to use this in the tub with a 2-wk-old baby -- but i loved it almost as soon as i tried it.  it's soft with plenty of cushioning so she's relaxed and comfortable.  the material holds in water and stays warm.  the head is slightly angled upward so it's harder for the standing water to get into her ears.  it's easy to squeeze out and hang up to dry on the shower rod (though it takes until the next day to get completely dry).  i haven't had any issues with it getting smelly, after 4 months of twice-a-week use.  but the directions on the tag clearly tell you how to wash it, if it does start to smell.  now that my daughter's bigger and her feet reach past the bottom, she loves kicking her feet in the water.  i think i'm going to start gifting these to pregnant friends.
It's 3am. It's been an hour since the baby ate last and you have finally slipped into REM sleep. Beautiful sleep... you start to dream and BAM! The baby lets out a cry and you look at the clock. Letting out a groan you roll out of bed and stumble to the baby. The baby is still asleep but that won't last long if you can't locate the pacifier. Thank goodness you thought to buy a MAM Night Glow pacifier. Instead blindly feeling around the bed... then crawling around the floor hoping you can find it in time... You spot the pacifier immediately, pop it into baby's mouth and he/she makes that classic Maggie Simpson sucking noise. Silently you tip-toe back to bed and hope it lasts...<br /><br />Bottom line: Even if it's been hours since the pacifier has been exposed to light, it still emits a decent glow so you can locate it in the darkest of rooms. I only buy the glow in the dark pacifiers now. Unlike many other pacifiers MAM pacifiers can be put in two ways.... there is no &#34;right side&#34; up. This makes giving it to baby in the middle of the night that much easier. I love MAM and will continue to buy these for my babies!
i'm a full-time mom, so i only needed a pump for occasional use, to build up a little stock in the freezer or for the odd day when i was going to be away from the baby. this pump is perfect for that.  it's plenty powerful - the variable suction strength more than exceeds what i need to pump as efficiently as possible.  i usually use it plugged into an outlet, but i've had to run it on the batteries probably a dozen times so far and i'm still on the original set of batteries.  it's compact and comes with a carry bag so everything stays together in my day bag when i'm out of the house.<br /><br />some other reviewers had problems with the flange - i haven't had any issues so far, but medela includes an extra two or three flanges with the pump, so it's an easy fix if something happens.  and yes, condensation builds up in the tubing during a pumping session, but i've never had the condensation reach even halfway down the tube toward the motor.  and the instruction book clearly says that if you run the pump (detached from the bottle) for a few minutes after you're done pumping, the condensation clears out.  works like a charm!
We've been using these pacifiers since our daughter was about 6 weeks old.  We never switched to the super soothie (which is the 2 pack of pink ones you see in the drugstores) because my daughter never took to them.<br /><br />The pink/purple set is a fun change- I originally got them to try broaden my daughter's horizons a bit after my friend mentioned that her daughter was so obsessed with her green soothie that even at 2+ years old she is enamoured with anything that turquoise color!<br /><br />The downside is that now my daughter LOVES the purple one and insists on it by name (papo one!), so to have another onhand, I need to buy a whole new package!  You might be thinking that if one's child is old enough to demand the soothie by name and color she is probably too old to be using this thing?  I say I would think the same thing.  Don't do what I did- break your little one's addition in the 9-12 month timeframe, becuase if you leave it until 20 months (where we are now) it's probably become your child's 'lovey' by now and they are well addicted.  We'll tackle this issue soon, but til then, I need another purple soothie.
we got this as a christmas gift for my 18 month old, and i stored it. i finally pulled it out when my goddaughters came to spend a week with us, and i needed something to entertain 4 children while i washed the entire crew down. it was a huge hit. reviews that there are few bubbles may have to do with poor or old bubble solution. it does use a lot (but it makes lots of bubbles,) and when i went to get more bubbles out of my closet, the old bubble solutions and the cheap ones, did not work nearly as well as the newer, better quality ones.  the difference is dramatic... gobs of bubbles with one, hardly any with the other. of course, i have dropped it into the water already, and it is still working. you do not want to leave the bubble solution in after you finish using the toy.  i did and when i started it up again after 5 days of non use, part of the solution had evaporated, leaving a thicker fluid and the motor had a hard time moving the wheel around - it also produced minimal bubbles.  so, empty it if you are not using it at every bath time. if it broke today, i would buy it again. at only $12-13, what do you really expect?
We swore we would never use a pacifier.  8 weeks later, we've now tried 4 different pacifiers (AVENT freeflow, AVENT orthodontic infant pacifier, AVENT soothie and NUK classic), and this is the only one our 2 month old son doesn't spit out instantaneously.  The material seems very durable and it's easy to clean.  We think he may like the shape because it's closer to simulating a nipple or a pinky finger.<br /><br />The shape is a bit different from the 3 other brands we have, but I actually find I like it better.  It doesn't lay flush to the baby's mouth, which allows saliva to run or dry.  With the other pacifiers that curve with baby's face, the saliva just pools around his mouth and caused a little bit of skin irritation.  Our baby may have sensitive skin, but it seems better with this soothie.  One disadvantage is that it pops out easily and has nothing to keep it in place - though I guess we could get around this by fastening it to him, but we were paranoid about having anything hanging around his neck.<br /><br />I guess every baby is different, but our little boy gives the Phillips AVENT soothie for 0-3 months 5 stars.
i've had this rack since our daughter's birth in february 2009.  we have the dr. brown's bottles with all their attendant pieces (which are really annoying to wash over and over again, but that's a different issue!), and have gone through the 4 oz. size and now use the 8 oz size.  in both cases we have had around 8 bottles \\active\\ at any one time and this rack is truly awesome in its capability to hold all the parts for that many bottles, due to its 2 tiers.  if we didn't have the tube-like inserts which go inside the bottle (to de-bubble the milk/formula), it could hold more bottles, but we use the top tier tines to hold those inserts, and it's perfect.  the bottles mostly go on the bottom rack tines, and all the other parts (caps, nipples, etc.) go in the middle.  other things like pacifiers, etc. can go there, too.  yes, the tines can come out pretty easily but in everyday use this has only happened a few times to me.  and no, this is not a good rack for glass bottles.  all in all, an awesome rack which appears to have much larger capacity than others, while still being (relatively) space-saving due to the 2-tier design.
i have a rambunctious 17 month old that finds a way to destroy everything in my house. i had two high-end, expensive gates from a popular baby chain store that did not last one year. i replaced them with two other high-end, expensive gates of a different brand. i thought that in order to get good quality i had to pay a lot. finally, after four broken gates and a large credit card bill, i bought this gate. i paid $35 for it, received it in two days (thanks to amazon prime) and have loved it since the day i installed it! it looks great, swings effortlessly in either direction, has thus far withstood my 26lb baby boy climbing and swinging on it, and even stands up to my 65lb dog who constantly jumps up on it. we have had it for about four months loved it so much i bought a second one for my home, and one for my dad's house too. my favorite part is that it does not have a bottom bar. perfect for the doorway we put it in, which has a threshold already. and great for my dad's, as he was constantly tripping over the bar on the previous gate. so happy i found this! going to recommend this gate to everyone i know with kids and/or dogs.
I added this to my baby registry and my daughter loves it! She is almost 5 months old now and she cannot sleep without dragon. My Aunt bought it for her and it is by far her favorite paci! I have tried others when dragon needs washed (by hand) and I had to buy a red and yellow puppy wubbanub because it closely resembles the dragon...<br />The pacifier is very securely stitched onto the dragon and it is relatively easy to clean. Just wash it in the sink with mild dishsoap and a cloth.<br />Ultimately this is a great paci, just wish they weren't so expensive.<br /><br />UPDATE: My daughter is now almost 2 years old and she still loves this binky. It is her absolute favorite! I had to buy a second one just in case the first one needed cleaned. Now, she sleeps with both and will NOT sleep without at least 2: 1 in her mouth and the other in her hand.<br />The stitching has held up wonderfully through the extensive use. I have not had to do any mending to it at all. I also started throwing the binkies in the washing machine on cold (delicate) and throw them in the dryer on low. Cleans them and they have stood up against the washings!
i recently ordered &#34;yourecofamily&#34; fitted crib sheet in beige. i must say i am very pleased with this purchase. i love the fact that it is 100% organic cotton, free from any chemicals, as i feel this is better for an infant, especially one that may have allergies or breathing problems or sensitive skin. organic has become highly recommended for children as well as adults. the size 28&#34; x 52&#34; x 9&#34; fits a standard crib mattress perfectly and has a really nice feel to it. i hope that they will come out with some different colors but for now the beige will work just fine. in fact, it would be perfect as a shower gift ... to be used for &#34;unisex&#34; gift.  also available is the flat sheet, pillowcases, and crib skirt, also &#34;organic&#34;.  the sheet comes packaged in a gift-style box, ready to give. i look forward to ordering more as needed. this was an excellent &#34;amazon&#34; purchase and as always, i am never disappointed. i did however; receive this product at a discount price in exchange for my honest, unbiased review. the price however does not affect my opinion of this product. you will love them :)
old review:  I bought these because my baby likes soothie pacifiers and I thought these were cuter.  As I read the packaging I saw they have a polycarbonate base surrounded by silicone.   BPA is used to make polycarbonate.  The BPA is surrounded by silicone, but if the silicone barrier fails you are giving your baby BPA to suck on.  I did notice the packaging very carefully says pthalate and latex free, but no mention of BPA because it is not BPA free.  Too bad because I do like them better than the soothies, but for me it's just not worth even the potential risk of spending a good part of the day sucking on BPA.  edited to add:  I noticed that they are now listed as BPA free on the website and emailed them.  They sent me back a note that they made a change to the internal guard last year and no longer sell the ones with polycarbonate!  I found that very very reassuring and would now happily use them.   From their email:  Our GumDrop is BPA Free.  We had made a change to the internal guard last year and no longer sell the GumDrop with the polycarbonate guard.  I really respect a company that responds to the concerns of worried moms!
we debated baby monitors for just about 9 months. we went back on forth on the brands and if we should get one with a movement monitor. at the end of the day toys r us had a sale on this monitor. the picture is great day or night. we can get about 100-200 feet away from the house out in the yard or garden before signal is lost. the sound is very clear. the color sound bar lights up when baby makes noise which is nice if you have the tv up a little louder or generally don't pay attention very well. we have the camera hung on the wall above the crib and it pans and tilts just fine. i used it to &#34;spy&#34; on my wife while she was nesting in the nursery before the baby was born. since then the novelty has worn off. the zoom is digital and we don't use it much. this camera has only a single green led visible at night and it is small. you cannot see the infrared lights at all. we have not used the night light mode at all, but have accidentally turned it on once or twice. the two way voice is nice, but our 8 month old doesn't really seem to care. seems to be a solid product. does not suffer any noticeable interference from nearby wifi.
This is a very nice diaper bag. It doesn't have much padding, but is lightweight. There are  lots of pockets to help you organize your baby's stuff. Two of the inside pockets are large enough to hold diapers and/or wipes. This bag features a swivel hook for keys.<br />The bag can be used as a shoulder bag. It also has straps that are designed to attach to a stroller. I love that feature.<br /><br />I haven't had to test this, but the bag is advertised to be waterproof, made with waterproof 600D microfiber. Of course, it is water resistant too & easy to clean.<br /><br />I really like this bag. It's neatly stitched, is lightweight, waterproof, has several inside & outside pockets, comes with several accessories: changing pad, bottle & pacifier cases, PVC bag for messy clothes, a hanging swivel hook for your keys, & stroller straps.<br /><br />The shoulder strap is not padded, but the carrying handles are. The main zippers, all the straps & handles are dark brown.<br /><br />My daughter, who will be using the bag, loves the Black Bird design.<br />I think it would make a nice crochet tote too.

love the mat!  so happy about the purchase.  rolls up, very light and travels easily.  we take it to other people's houses and on vacations (haven't taken it on the plane yet).  awesome on vacation because you don't want your baby crawling and playing around on gross hotel room carpet.  perfect size.  cover washes great and easy to get on.  it also is a great neutral color that works well with the d茅cor of most rooms.  it works great on rugs, tile and wood floors.  i've never seen it slip on tile.<br /><br />note - i saw some reviews saying that the cover was hard to get back on once it had been washed but i completely disagree.  super easy and i'm usually terrible with stuff like that.  i wash it once a week and i've never had a problem.<br /><br />recommendations to manufacturer: (1) sell replacement covers so i can use the mat while the i'm washing the cover, (2) maybe offer a bigger mat option if people want to fill up an entire room.  a more permanent mat solution.<br /><br />the only con is the price.  very expensive for a play mat but worth it.  organic, high quality and made in the usa.  would purchase a dozen more if i could!!
This is an excellent product. It may look a little expensive for a thermometer, but it's a good price if you consider the peace of mind the can bring to your life, especially at night when you have a sick infant or toddler having fever episodes due to a virus or other reason. When after struggling to give them some medicine and help to go to sleep, They finally feel better and go to sleep, the last thing you want to do is to wake them up by trying to check on theirs temperature. When my 1 year old daughter was sick with flu like symptons, including fever, it was a big relief for me and my wife knowing that we could just get close to her and check her temperature without touching her body; that made a world of a difference. We compared this thermometer we many others we have and find it to be as accurate as any good conventional thermometer could be. Thank you AJ WHOSALE for this wonderful product.                                         ***Feb 25, 2016.-- Still Wonderfull after about 3 years of use. Working p erfectly. Thanks one more time for this device. It's been a really useful tool the past 3 years.  Part of my best invested money.
Our 16 month old loves her WubbaNubs we've used them since she came home from the hospital. These are much easier for her to hold onto and not lose than a regular pacifier. The animals make it easier for her to carry them around without dropping. The make it easier for mom and dad to spot them and keep track of them. At night she loves to cuddle them in her crib meaning she's had no need for a separate security blanket or doll or stuff animal.<br /><br />The animals themselves seem to be sewn very well. With constant use for 16 months I think only one has started to shown a stitch starting to break. As the baby's teeth came in she eventually chewed through some of her oldest most used ones. At that point we just took scissors and cut off the pacifier part of those. Then she still has the ole familiar stuffed animal to play with.<br /><br />As a dad, I can stuff the animal in my pocket like a handkerchief and leave the pacifier hanging out so it doesn't get nasty.<br /><br />These limited edition ones are very cute. This is one of those items people stop you in the store to say how adorable they are and wish they had them when they had kids.
we, my daughter, grandson, and i love avent bottles and now theses cups.  we have tried others and they just don鈥檛 make our baby as happy as avent.<br /><br />he is mr. independent and really likes to take care of things without help if he can.  i told my daughter that she has a two-year old attitude in a one-year baby.  since he was about four or five months old he has wanted to eat or drink what we had to eat or drink.<br /><br />i have tried many different kinds of sippy cups, expensive to cheap, but nothing i tried worked until i found this one.  he wants what we have, but he is just not ready to give up the nipple.  he really likes drinking out of these.<br /><br />yes, he can hold a bottle, but with the handle these are different from a bottle and more like the cup that i have.  if we fill these with water, what i drink, or juice he really likes these.<br /><br />he will now drink with the spout, but there are times when he is tired that he still prefers the nipple.  we like that we have the option.  for our baby these saved many problems with a child that wants to be independent, but is not quite capable of doing it all by himself yet.
as new parents we purchased this video monitor on amazon in early 2010. the audio/video quality was very good (too sharp you can even hear the slightest noise made by the baby). the frequency range is excellent too. one time i had to go down to pick up something from the car and my baby was sleeping in the 3rd floor and so i took the monitor with me. being in the ground floor i was still able to watch my baby sleep with no difficulties in the video/audio. i would have given it 5 stars then, but i forgot to write the review. one day i accidently dropped the monitor into the bath tub and i freaked out!!!!!!!!! i immediately removed the batteries, wiped out clean and let it dry in the sun for a few hours. i checked the monitor to see if it was working and it still worked great with the same excellent quality!!!!!!!! i never really thought it would work and i was already cursing myself for the mistake i did. this happened in june 2011 and now even after 6 months, its workin fine. i decided its definitely time to write a good review and here it is! we still use it everyday and its definitely one of the best purchases we've made. best video monitor!!!
i am very pleased with this product. it definitely makes me feel more comfortable with our little one following us around in the kitchen. it prevents him from grabbing the pan/pot handles, and possibly dumping their hot contents onto himself. it keeps his hand out of the fire. it also keeps what we are cooking out of his line of sight so he isn't as interested. i also like that it does warm up enough to warn him that he shouldn't be messing around with it, but not enough to hurt him.<br /><br />the installation is very easy. i did have to pull our stove/oven away from the wall to fit the velcro attachments, but it was a breeze otherwise<br /><br />my only complaint with this purchase was the lack of prime shipping options. i'm definitely spoiled by amazon now. i almost didn't buy it specifically because of the ~$10 to shipping (which increases the cost of this item by 1/3). i'm sure they are losing a significant amount of sales due to this. it also took 9 days to arrive which seems absurd now that amazon has conditioned me to think 2 day shipping should be free.<br /><br />aside from the shipping cost/experience, the product itself is wonderful.
Being a first time working mom I needed to get an electrical pump so that I could send milk to day care.  I had planned on buying the Medula because that is what anyone I know used.  When I got to Babies-R-Us the sales lady talked me into the Playtex.  She said they had just had a demonstration at the store about the pump and if she was to buy a pump over again she would go with this one.  She said she has a Medula, but after the demonstration she really liked this one.  So, on her advice and the basis that this would be cheaper for me because I had coupons I went for it! <br /> <br />I find the pump to be very comfortable and I use full speed and suction.  I do not get sore like I used to when I used my manual Medula from the hospital.   The storage is great and it is very easy to clean! <br /> <br />After about a month of use I did have a problem where the pump would randomly shut off and eventually stopped working.  I called Playtex and they overnighted me a new pump nad sent me a tag to return the old one free of charge.    I went less than 24 hours without it.  They were great to deal with. <br /> <br />I would recommend this pump to anyone!
We bought every binky known to man for my daughter, and she was not having ANY of them. I could tell she wanted one, but just couldn't find the right way to suck on any. By the grace of god, we found one our first daughters binkys mixed it with her baby clothes. She took right to it. We were so happy. It was the gerber soft center pacifier in the big round bulb shape. I looked for 5 months EVERYWHERE for the same binky. No luck. I even called gerber, and the lady lied to me saying they never sold a bigger version of this kind of binky. She said it must have swollen to that size. Please. I have read quite a few blogs about other moms trying to find the same bigger version. Makes me wonder what they are hidding....I was so frustrated and ready to give up. Finaly I came across this site and it looked very similar to hers. After I read 2 reviews saying the same thing about the gerber binkys, I thought it was worth a try. As soon as I gave it to her, she loved it!! YEA!!! I also love the fact that it is one piece and natural. I have read about another mommy who has this for her kids and she says you most certianly can go longer then 4-6 weeks to replace.
we have been using this motorola mbp36 monitor for over a month and it is great!! this is actually our third monitor and by far our favorite. for our 2.5 year old, we started with a sound-only monitor. it worked well but we realized how helpful it would be to see him. our first video monitor broke so, when we had our second child, we decided to try motorola and i'm so happy we did.<br /><br />pros:<br />+so so easy to set up! we just placed the camera on a book shelf in our daughter's room and used the buttons on the side of the screen to get a good picture.<br />+the picture is really clear and our camera isn't even that close to her crib. if i hear her fussing, i love being able to see if she is standing (not going to go to sleep) or laying down (going to go to sleep). such a huge help!<br />+great range. i can take it in the backyard or the basement when i'm with my son and still see whether my daughter is asleep.<br />+easy to navigate and i love the color indicator on the top to see whether she's crying if i have the sound turned down.<br /><br />cons:<br />honestly, i don't have any. i'm really happy with this monitor. third times the charm. :)
gorgeous and simple. perfect for a little baby girl. i've given one to both of my god daughters at their baptisms. hoping to start a family tradition, i'll be ordering a blue one in a few months for our next addition, and his too will be brought to church to be blessed alongside our family during his baptismal ceremony.   a little extra info on the product itself, since i've had 2 now, for those like me, who'd like as much info as possible when ordering online: the little porcelain case each rosary sits in is slightly different each time, and does not close tightly. it is meant to just sit on top, so it will not &#34;secure&#34; the rosary. the pieces will come in a small box, perfect for wrapping or putting into a tiny bag (gift idea...i usually add a crib ornament with this and it's a complete gift for any newborns' baptism). the inside is wrapped in small bubble wrap, so it is packaged and shipped very nicely. there is a little pink pillow, blue for boy, and then the little rosary. it is literally sent to you ready to be wrapped up, or hand delivered as is. i hope this helps. th trees really nothing else to mention about this product. feel free to ask.
We purchased these in preparation for our new baby.  They started holding baby and diaper supplies for us to use and now a year and a half later have turned into toy bins for her.  We were able to re-purpose some of our existing furniture to make it more kid friendly.  We've used a combination of these bins on bottom shelves full of toys and the smaller bins on the above shelves with smaller toys and books.  I have also found them handy on a self near our front door for all those extra things you need quickly as you're running out the door with someone in your arms.  We now have 6 larger, 4 small, and 2 matching hampers used through out the house; and in the brown they match both in her room and in the public areas of the house.<br /><br />We also move every couple years and once the bins are emptied into moving boxes the bins themselves are inconvenient to pack and we have broken numerous different types over the years.  I look forward to our next move with these, and being able to collapse them all and put them in a moving box as well.<br /><br />--  Simple but great product, the uses for them are endless; and so good so far holding up to a toddlers use.
I first bought this item when my son was a little less than 2 months old. He loved Soothie he got from the hospital but he kept dropping it. I wanted to get this one so that my son could hold it. He absolutely loved it! He went everywhere with it. He also played with it like a toy. Most of the time,this paci was the only way to calm my son down. I washed it in the regular washing machine with rest of his clothes and dried it in a drier with high temp many times and it was still fine. I ended up buying total 4 of them for my son. The difficult part was to get rid of this pacifier from him. He didn't go to sleep with out it. He became so fussy without it. However, last month when my son was 20 month-old, he chewed the soothie badly and tier all of them off. I didn't buy another one for him but I gave him a little teether just to keep something in his mouth when he gets fussy. First 3 days without this paci were very rough but he became fine without it after a few days. Now he is 21 month old, and still chews on teether a few times a day just for a little bit, but he is completely pacifier-free. I am very happy. This pacifier helped my son and my family a lot.
i researched high chairs forever! i had heard so many things about bad fabric, poor design, ease of use that i wanted to make sure we got our choice right since we will be using this high chair for a long time. and i overanalyze everything. first of all, the fabric is easy to clean. spilled prune juice on it and i didn't notice for a couple hours and it came right out with water. i also really like that the entire fabric portion is easy to remove and can be thrown in the washing machine. there are handles to release the tray on the sides and front, which is really convenient. the harness system works really well, and it's easy to strap them in. the top portion of the tray come completely off and fits in a dishwasher. it is on wheels which i found to be very handy. the whole back of the seat reclines, which is great to use while learning to drink from a sippy cup. the height of it is adjustable too. i haven't removed the seat portion yet, but when we go on vacation we will be taking it with us, and i love having that option.  overall, awesome highchair and the price is great. and like i said, we looked at them everywhere for months and i did a lot of research!
first, i don't agree with the reviewer that said that it doesn't go through bag screening.  i went from madison, wi to honolulu and to kona and back with absolutely no problems.  and that included 2 small regional airports.  i have a britax marathon carseat.    this worked like a breeze for our trip...our first one with our 14 month old...and yes we picked hawaii (nuts, i know).  anyway, we left the cart on for the shorter flights but removed it for the minneapolis to honolulu leg.  most of our flights with first class, we did have one leg in coach...and i would not recommend keeping the cart on if flying coach in less you have the bulkhead row or no one sitting in from of your child.  our son was able to easily kick the seat in front, but only when the car was on.  plus, it makes the car seat sit up really straight, so our son was uncomfortable until after take-off when we could tilt his seat back.  but, if you do have to take the cart off, but practice at home a couple times and it is really easy.  i can put the cart back together in a matter of a few minutes...the same amount of time that you would have to wait anyway to get a stroller back from gate check!
My daughter absolutely LOVES her WubbaNub! I introduced it at a little over month originally because she had such a horrible time keeping pacifiers in her mouth! She would get so frustrated and angry. While the WubbaNub didn't solve ALL of our issues, it certainly helped. My daughter is exclusively breastfed and isn't really fond of pacifiers, but she absolutely adores her WubbaNub tiger. Now that she's older (4 months), she likes to hold on to his little legs or pet it. She honestly spends more time with the stuffed animal part than the pacifier!<br /><br />Her caretakers at daycare noticed how much it soothes her. We forgot it one day and well, let's just say that wasn't a good day for anyone... I think it's adorable that it gives her both something to suck on (and sometimes gnaw on), as well as comfort with the stuffed animal. I'll be sad when we have to take it away when she actually starts sprouting teeth! We'll probably just cut it off the pacifier and sew it closed, ha.<br /><br />To clean it, I usually just wipe off the pacifier. Since she takes it to daycare, I'll handwash the tiger in Dapple soap at least once every week or so and then hang it to dry.
I got one of these at the hospital, and it is the only pacifier my son has ever accepted. Highly recommend you at least try it if you haven't already. It's great, because you can stick your finger in and babies tend to latch onto it better when you do.<br /><br />And they look like a suckerfish, as you can see by looking down the translucent nub. It's entertaining AND useful.<br /><br />And I totally don't laugh at my child.<br /><br />---------UPDATE 10/18/2013----------<br />My second son is now four months old and he has never once liked these pacifiers. It is true that all babies are different, and they all have mouths of different shapes and sizes. It always seems like it is awkward for him to latch onto the soothies (I've tried both the 0-3 month and next size up). They work okay if we can hold our finger there, but once we let go he spits it right out.<br /><br />I am leaving my rating at five stars because they were still a lifesaver with my first-born. They are a quality product made out of a sturdy material, and the shape is brilliant (it is never going to get swallowed). I also recommend trying a few types, though. NUK is his favorite. Hope this helps!
We received a Wubbanub as a baby shower gift for our now 5 1/2 month old baby. She loves it! Initially I thought we would not use it, but as it happens, grandma popped it in her mouth while we were out one night when baby was only a few weeks old and it was an instant hit (we had previously only tried a couple other brands, which she rejected)  History was made and we have a slew of pictures to document her fondness! Only at over 5 months old now, it has become a bit of a distraction when trying to get her down: she loves to play with it (giraffe is what we have, which is totally cute) and the stuffed animal is something to tug on, thus pulling it out of her mouth.     I vowed to give this as future shower gifts and just sent the Ella Bella elephant one to my sister. I hope her new little one likes it, I haven't gotten any feedback yet. I have now been searching for a binky that is of similar feel but without the stuffed animal - something that won't be distracting for when we are trying to put her down. We will still use this one for awhile yet, though. Cleaning is not too much of an issue - can either throw it in the washing machine or hand wash to clean the animal.
this may be named a toddler pillow however i would like to deem it as my universal pillow.  i actually use this pillow as my go to pillow when rest my weary head. it really depends on my circumstance for the evening when i lay down to sleep. if my shoulders or neck hurts i will use this pillow as a wedge between my head and neck in an attempt to give myself comfort when a level head is needed. or if my back has been bothering me, i will use it as a wedge between my legs/knees. in my opinion this pillow works well for it's' intended purposes. i actually did let my 4 yr old use it the night i first received it. he used it while watching t.v. downstairs with the family. it was after i took him up to bed did i need something to ease my discomfort and the pillow was the closest possibility to me. i have not used this for travel, we don't travel in the ways that would require pillows; but have found the perfect use for my needs. it also comes with a removable case, that is washable. which is a lifesaver, as these style and size pillow cases aren't readily available. i was able to test this product out as a promotional purchase for review purposes. i actually use this pillow
it's pretty comfortable. i'm a big woman and i've passed out on it whilst reading to my kid a few times already. my 6-year-old loves it too. it did set me back, so i bought a bed bug cover, but no extra padding or anything special to make it softer, and i have no idea what the other reviewers are talking about that it's too hard. it's firm, as it should be.<br /><br />here is something to know: when i first got it, i wasn't sure if it should have these weird black flecks all over the mattress. the answer is yes. i called naturepedic to ask. the cotton is unbleached, and you will see wheaty and black flecks that look kind of ew. but it beats the hell out of toxins, imo.<br /><br />delivery was fine. two guys came and delivered on a saturday (because the delivery service calls to arrange a time you'll be home), and they were pretty flexible. the box was beat up, but on the inside, the bed was clean, in a factory sealed bag, with all the tags and warranty stuff. so it worked out fine to order something so huge in the mail.<br /><br />i can't imagine regretting having bought my kid a non-toxic mattress. seems worth the price and the hassle of going out of my way to buy it.
Mr Monkey as we call him, has been one of the best investments that we've made since our daughter was born. We got our first one even our daughter was 4 months old and we haven't looked back even though she is now 17 months and well past the she listing on the package. Mr Monkey helped our daughter learn to self soothe early on as it was easier for her to find in the dark of her crib at night and even before she could figure out how to get the pacifier back in her mouth she was at least able to pull his foot or arm up to her face and that seemed to calm her. We've glove through a few of them now that she has most of her teeth but it's well worth buying replacements as her monkey still is her favorite soother. When she's fussy we just ask her to go adds find Mr Monkey and that usually does the trick to calm her down.<br /><br />For those with concerns about keeping it clean, I just throw the whole thing in the washer (we also have the giraffe version of this so we always have one available while the other is being washed). When it comes out of the dryer I just hand wash the pacifier part to rid it of any fuzz or residue and there you have it, a fresh clean wubbanub. ;-)
My daughter has been using the original gumdrop pacifiers since she was a month old and we do also have a few soothies just for back up even though those aren't her favorite... she is now almost 19 months old and just gets the pacifiers for bedtime and naptime and she also teethes on them.... the gumdrops are really wearing and not holding up well (i know we've been using them awhile but we've had 14 of the gumdrops) .... when i ordered these first years gumdrops i didn't realize that i was ordering something different than the original gumdrops... when they came in the mail today i noticed that they seem alot more sturdy and durable than the original gumdrops!... now we just got them today but i think i like them better than the original just because the material seems like it will hold up better and my daughter was very excited to get them in the mail too, she didn't seem to notice a difference! also i accidentally ordered a newborn pack as well as an infant pack but i really don't see a difference.... possibly the original gumdrops would be better for a newborn and baby who is not teething?... but i would definitely recommend these, especially once babies are getting teeth!
we now have two of these bibs! i ordered our first several months ago and was so happy with it that we ordered this second one.  i love that it's large enough for my almost 2-year-old to use while eating (she is messy!), but also big enough for my 3 1/2 year old to use while finger painting (she isn't quite as messy...).  a great bonus is the ability to throw these in the wash.  i try not to do that too often since i would like to preserve the velcro as long as possible (washing them with soap and water in the sink has kept them fresh as well!)  once the velcro does wear out i will use my kam snap device to convert the velcro to snaps.  we have tried and gotten rid of lots and lots of bibs over the years and this is one of the few that i will likely buy even more of as my 3rd child begins solids.<br /><br />a side note - others have mentioned the pocket being sewn down the center rather than being completely open to catch food.  i haven't found this to be a problem, and it might be that it's because the bib is long enough that the pocket is sometimes under the table - tucked in, per say.  i tend to use a shorter, stiffer bib when my kiddos are little and just beginning to eat solids.
i have now purchased this gate three times!  once as a gift and twice for myself.  when we initially tried to install the gate, we couldn't get it to latch together.  we thought it was defective and needed to be returned.  that was not the case!  they actually have a paper that says there is a gap (i can't remember the reason) and they tell you how to fix it.  if we had read the paperwork carefully, we would have known this from the start.  unfortunately, we have not had to use the extensions so i cannot review the extension at this time.  also, i cannot review this product in terms of a toddler.  we are currently using it to keep pets out of bedrooms as we don't have doors on the hinges right now.  we have had no problems passing through these gates late at night without lights and i do imagine this will make an excellent gate whenever we eventually have children.  the height is very nice.  we had a wooden gate but our little yorkie was able to jump high enough to pull herself over the gate.  the wooden gate also had places where i felt she could get her little claws/paws caught, which is not the case with this gate.  we this gate daily and have had no problems with the latches or anything else!
My son was a preemie, and the NICU gave him the GumDrop preemie and full-term pacifier to use during his long hospitalization -- he absolutely loved it! Designed by a medical company, and made of hospital-grade silicone, the GumDrop is lightweight, very soft, and features a unibody construction, so there are no parts that can come loose. The shape of the pacifier allowed him (and all the other preemies in the NICU) to use it in the side-lying position, even with all his tubes (i.e. CPAP, nasal cannula, nasal gavage tube, etc.). You can put your finger in the open end, allowing you to easily control or hold the pacifier; it also allows you to feel how strong your baby's suck is. NNS (non-nutritive sucking) is very important for a baby's development, and our baby got to practice a lot of NNS with his GumDrop. It helped him to self-soothe himself as well when we couldn't be at his cribside.     Following his discharge, I have purchased two full-term mango colored pacifiers for his use. The company has since introduced full-term pink and blue colored pacifiers, but I would purchase the mango colour again. Overall, I highly recommend this product. The price is great, although the S/H charges are high.
there is nothing better than looking back and seeing your little one safe and sound. rear facing is ideal for longer than most are aware. often times babies are turned around sooner than they should be because moms and dads are trying to keep an eye on them, or can鈥檛 see them, or their kiddo wants to see them. for their safety it鈥檚 best to keep them rear facing as long as possible and having a quality baby mirror makes that a bit easier to do.<br /><br />they made a mirror that has a clear view, and lets you see your precious baby in their safe rear facing car seat. the view is so clear that your baby will not have a difficult time seeing you as well.<br /><br />this baby mirror was super easy to install, and can be used with almost every vehicle as far as i can tell. the design provides for a large visible space, it is not heavy or bulky. i love affordable, quality baby items. if you don鈥檛 have a little one, you might consider buying one of these for someone you know who will be having a little one soon or has one! i think the design is actually really cute, and the soft rounded edges seem more appealing to me.<br /><br />**i received a free product for a review. my opinions are 100% honest and my own.**
i am a mother to 5, including 12 week old twins. this is my first time using bottles (older kids breastfed exclusively), so i started with the ones made by the pump manufacturer and used at the hospital. one twin was having a tough time with those nipples, so we switched to dr brown. that twin seemed to do better with dr brown, but the other twin didn't like those (the nipple is narrow), so i ordered these born free bottles. both twins did so well with these! i really like that they are wide mouth, which makes cleaning easier. although they do have five parts of you count everything separately, it is so easy to take them apart and put them together --- really it only takes a few seconds --- that i personally don't consider it a problem whatsoever! i think the system for preventing air gulping a highly effective, and that and the nipples work so well!  i did move onto the glass version of these but still use the plastic and like to take the plastic in the diaper bag just because they're lighter. i love both the plastic and the glass and highly recommend these to anyone. i quickly put away all of the other brands and have been exclusively using the born free since about a week after i bought that first set.
i got this \\baby food storage\\ item to freeze liquid leftovers such as pasta sauce or my chili con carne that i make by the pounds on weekends. i hesitated to spend almost twenty bucks on something that ziplock bags could do, but eventually figured that a reusable container would be cheaper in the long run, and more convenient immediately.<br /><br />i can confirm that the almost-too-good-to-be-true product description is accurate: the silicone cleans ridiculously easily with just soap water, it doesn't warp in the dishwasher, doesn't smell at all, and it remains amazingly supple when frozen to -22c/-8f (that's what my freezer can do; spec says -40c/-40f). getting the frozen food out was initially a bit of a struggle, but one vendor's tip was golden: if i let it sit for one minute at room temperature, the still rock- hard pieces push out easily.<br /><br />the one thing that took a little getting used to was securing the lid. basically, it's a floppy rubber piece with eight latches that are a bit hard to put on, and if you nudge anything while putting it into the freezer, it'll come undone easily. but that's just the price of having a freeze- proof, sealing container, so i won't ding my rating for that.
. I had purchased EVERY SINGLE brand and style of pacifier.  My daughter refused them all except the soothies. The Wubbanub is a Soothie pacifier with an animal attached. I saw a friend with a Wubbanubs so I ordered one to try. It's been a life saver!! At 6wks old she clings to the animal. The weight of the animal helps the pacifier stay in her mouth especially when she's laying on her back or in the car seat. A tip when using the a soothie style pacifier,  put a finger in the whole while she's sucking on it, they like the way it feels.  We have the monkey, giraffe and duck. The giraffe is her favorite. Not sure why its more expensive though. And, babies r us carries these for only $10.95<br /><br />Regarding cleaning, there are 3 ways to clean/sterilize them.<br />1. Boil : Put a ziplock bag around animal, dip pacifier part in a bowl boiling water and let soak for 5-10 mins. This sterlizes It. At the end of each day  I take a a paper towel with soap and hot water and wash the pacifier part.<br />2. Dishwasher : I used the bottle basket and put on top shelf of dishwasher. Then let air dry. I washed our monkey this way.<br />3. Washing machine : put in garment bag and wash.  Let air dry. Do not put in dryer.
These were the first WubbaNubs we purchased & since have bought several more so they are always laying about!<br /><br />I purchased this product after using the Phillips Avent Soothie Pacifiers for my little daughter. They are the only pacifiers she has ever taken. It's also the kind they gave her while she was in the NICU at the hospital. I am so glad someone came up with this idea!<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. Cute animals for boys & girls!<br />2. Easy to keep track of - easy to see in a dark bedroom at night & also when you are holding the baby, they are much easier to grab as they are falling than a Paci alone<br />3. Stays in better than a Soothie Paci by itself - we often prop the animal on her chest and she seems to love holding on to the soft stuffed animal & can even sometimes push it back into her own mouth (and she's only 10 weeks!)<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. Tedious cleaning - I usually wash them on gentle in the washing machine but worry about my daughter ingesting detergent residue so I usually then wash off the pacifier top with a pacifier wipe<br />2. Falls out - not as much as when it's only the pacifier - could just be my daughters tongue pushing it out or something but I think worth mentioning
i was so hesitant in ordering these seats, but i am so glad i did.  the other reviews said how helpful they were for bathing more than one small child at once.  i was worried my boys wouldn't like them and would feel restrained.  i couldn't have been more wrong.  they love them!  they are now one and have been using them for over 6 months.  i went with this design since it has the slanted front that allows the boys to lean comfortably to splash or reach for toys.  the seats do float up or move pretty easily when you try to put them in since they only have suctions cups and we have a textured surface on our bathtub.  this is not an issue since they are always supervised. we would not be able to give them baths at the same time so easily any other way.  they were also great for the summer time.  we took them to the beach house in the summer and they doubled as safety seats in the plastic swimming pool when there were not enough hands to hold both.  they probably could even be used as feeding chairs when traveling if need be.  our boys will be out of them soon once they figure out how to try to get out of them and stand up in the tub.  we have gotten so much use out of them and they are easy to clean and hang dry.
These are great pacifiers. We tried several types/brands before these and my daughter likes these the best by far.<br /><br />Advantages over others:<br />I really wanted to use the avent soothies but they just wouldn't stay in my daughters mouth. They bumped her nose and in general just looked too large and slightly uncomfortable.<br /><br />I also tried other nuk pacifiers. What I liked about them was the shape. The heart shaped shield seemed to fit better and just looked more comfortable. The shape of the pacifier nipple was shorter and the shape seemed easier and more enjoyable for my daughter to keep in her mouth. She loved it but it wasn't my favorite because it couldn't be sterilized and water would get trapped in the nipple. It just didn't seem as hygienic as I would have liked.<br /><br />Then I found these. The orthostar pacifiers are the best. They are all one silicone piece, similar to the avent pacifiers. They can be sterilized and there is no way for water to get trapped anywhere. They have the great shape that is more comfortable for my daughter's face and the nipple is just the right size and shape to make it easy for her to keep it in her mouth. This is by far mommy and baby's favorite pacifier!
bought this when our son was 3 months old.  wish we'd bought it the day we brought him home!  our baby was a massive spitter-upper and more than once choked on spit-up.  he also insisted on sleeping on his belly - screamed and threw a fit if he was on his back and just refused to sleep; he learned how to roll over at a very, very young age as well as he was so adamant that he sleep on his belly.  before we bought this i could not get a decent night's sleep for fear that something was going to happen to him - i kept waking up constantly to check on him and every little noise would send me into a fully awake panic.  this product works like a charm!  the alarm did go off a couple of times and woke him up enough to start breathing again or got us up in time to help the baby (it sets off the alarm if no motion is detected for 10 seconds).  it saved my sanity and most likely my precious baby.  i would strongly suggest this to anyone - it may seem expensive but after having used it i would have happily paid a great deal more.  the only thing to remember is when they wake up to eat in the middle of the night you need to remember to shut off the monitor or you will scare your spouse to death when the alarm goes off.  :-)
my wife and i were against buying a bassinets simply because it would only be used for a few months then it would just take up space. not to mention most bassinets are ugly and the only decent looking ones are crazy expensive. when we both saw this play pen we knew we found a happy medium.  set up was easy right out of the box. the instructions make things go really fast. snap the arms up, then push down on the middle. the stages pad has slots that metal bars slide through. these metal bars snap into the top corners of the crib. it is light and easy to move around. it is about 2ft wide by 3ft long and this fit perfectly in our bedroom without getting in the way.  i really like the fact that we will be able to use this play pen for many years to come. it compact enough that we can take it anywhere with worrying about space. it's big enough that i think even an 18month old could use it as a play pen with out feeling claustophobic.  i would highly recommend this play pen/bassinet to any shop savy parent who wants their baby in their room for the first couple of months, but doesn't want to feel like they're wasting money. let's not forget the fact that it is also a play pen!  bottom line- great item for a great price.
So.... my baby girl started with the gumdrop pacifier from the hospital when she turned 1 month old. I tried until 8 months old to switch to other paci that i thought would be better shaped for her mouth since she loooooooves to suck all the time...<br />well not other would do as the one from the hospital. So after buying so many others I bought those ones hoping they would do the trick (when she was about 7 months).<br />Well it is perfect! They are of hard but yet soft plastic so no fear of her breaking them, they have a little handle with a hole so I use a paci holder, they are the exact same size as the gumdrop we got from the hospital.<br />They are great for breastfed babies from my experience, as they reproduce the nipple quite nicely.<br />They do not leave marks on the baby face while sucking on them, and fall of the mouth easily when they stop sucking - i like that as compared to some others that they keep the whole time even after they passed out.<br />So far I have still been using the same one for the past 2 months so they are durable.<br />They also wash well : dishwasher or mild soap, the water does not get stocked into it so I feel it is healthier/cleaner than other ones.<br />Overall very satisfied
So this was a lifesaver for my newborn! He was breastfed for the first 3months n it really helped to not confuse him. But also he was an extremely fussy baby n still is.but we made the mistake of giving it to him for fussiness,sleeping everything. He became attached to it very quickly and wouldn't take any other pacifier when we were suppose to transition him off of it. But I thought no big deal what could it hurt. Well he is now 5months old and he did what they he could do. I had read of babies being able to stick the whole thing in their mouth n I too was a little skeptic about it but today he accomplished it! N thank goodness I was holding him when he did it because I had been putting him to bed with it and it could of been a lot worse. So yes some moms say that they have older babies taking it with no problems which might be the case BUT don't take the risk! Because when your baby starts teething like mine they want everything in their mouth and they get aggressive with it and believe it or not but they can fit it in their mouth! I hardly write reviews but I felt it was really important to let others know so no accidents happen! So a great pacifier for the beginning but make sure you transition into a new one!!!
As is common in these free-thinking, immoral days an unwed single mother left her unwanted child on my doorstep. At first I tried to phone social services they called me a racist homophobe and hung up. The police were similarly unhelpful. What was I to do? My wife suggested drowning him, but the council forces us to sort our rubbish at gunpoint, and which recycling bag do babies go in? It was clearly not the answer.<br /><br />Several times I tried leaving him at the local park, but no-one would take him - not even the strange homeless man with the 'Jesus is Love' sandwich board. It looked like we were doomed to a life or depressing parental drudgery.<br /><br />Then we discovered the 3ct Diamond Pacifier. At first we were skeptical - diamonds are mined in the third world, where poor people live! But we did notice it is pleasingly shiny and pacifier-shaped. Anyway, for less than the price of buying up the whole planet's nuclear weapons, we were rid of our problem! We simply popped it in his mouth and left him in what the proletariat call a shopping mall. He was gone in seconds!<br /><br />Thank you! If only all of life's problems could be solved by buying a $17,000 diamond pacifier. Unfortunately only most of them can.
we have 3 little ones, and a car seat for each of them in 2 different vehicles, and i've never seen a car seat look as comfortable as this one! the headrest is extra super padded, and i feel extra comfort that my baby is safe in this seat. my youngest is 9 months now, so we changed over from his infant seat to this one. (he's still rear-facing.)<br /><br />i like that this seat will carry him through the years, and we won't have to buy another one now. it is much chunkier than a typical infant seat, as you would expect. we have a 3 row explorer. my two oldest sit in the third row, so we let down the 2nd row seats to let them get out and in. we have this seat in the middle of the second row. letting those side seats up and down is now much more difficult, but it still works.<br /><br />another great feature about this seat is the fact that you don't have to take the straps in and out to adjust them. you just pull the headrest up and down depending on the height of your little one, and you're all set. i love that! we've adjusted a lot of straps through the years, and this is just an awesome time/pain saver!<br /><br />overall, this is a super padded/super comfortable(at least it looks to be...i haven't sat in it;)) seat!
i have had my joovy caboose ultralight for almost a month and love it. it is light weight and easy to fold and unfold. i have a 3 year old and a newborn, this stroller fit my needs perfect because my 3  year old doesn't like to always ride in a stroller, yet she gets tired of walking. the \\stand\\ part of the stroller is perfect for her, she can even sit down on the little bench if she wants too. the only problem i've encountered so far is that when using with an infant seat the older child does not have a lot of room to sit. however, that seems to bother me more than my 3 year old. i have a peg perego infant seat and it's fabulous that the joovy caboose compatible with that seat. i wish there was more storage, but i new before buying that storage was limited and made adjustments. i bought the j.j. kole diaper bag system that hangs on the handle (works fabulous). i also bought the parent tray for the joovy caboose and that holds everything i need at arms length . . . bottled water, keys, bottle, pacifier, phone . . . i am very satisfied with the stroller and would advise anyone looking at double strollers to consider this. especially if you have a toddler like mine who doesn't want to just sit in a stroller all the time.
This was the brand given in the hospital. I went home with two. It was a bit of a frustration for the first 6 weeks because my baby could not keep this in his mouth for too long without assistance. However, I wanted to stick with it because it's the only pacifier shaped most similarly to a real nipple, and I didn't want to introduce the chance of nipple confusion with a different pacifier.<br /><br />Right at 6 weeks, he was able to handle it much more consistently. At 8 weeks, he could keep it in his mouth all by himself. Now, at 11 weeks, he's quite a pro! I no longer have to reach over and help him keep it in his mouth.<br /><br />One day I gave him a different pacifier brand (received this different one as a gift), and I noticed that he had some difficulty latching to the breast for that whole day. Back to the Soothie, and no problems since then!  I ordered two packs of the 3+ month size from Amazon. I saw them in Rite Aid, but they were a bit more expensive. It would be perfect if it came with a case. I ordered a separate plastic case.<br /><br />Any basic pacifier clip with Velcro attachment can work to clamp it to baby's shirt. The pacifier has two holes so you can put the strap through the hole and keep it at hand.
I purchased this product after using the Phillips Avent Soothie Pacifiers for my little daughter. They are the only pacifiers she has ever taken. It's also the kind they gave her while she was in the NICU at the hospital. I am so glad someone came up with this idea!<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. Cute animal for girls or boys.<br />2. Easy to keep track of - easy to see in a dark bedroom at night & also when you are holding the baby, they are much easier to grab as they are falling than a Paci alone.<br />3. Stays in better than a Soothie Paci by itself - we often prop the animal on her chest and she seems to love holding on to the soft stuffed animal & can even sometimes push it back into her own mouth. She has also learned over time to guide it into her mouth on her own.<br />4. Durable - after several washes in the machine, it seems to be holding up just fine.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. Tedious cleaning - I usually wash them on gentle in the washing machine but worry about my daughter ingesting detergent residue so I usually then wash off the pacifier top with a pacifier wipe.<br />2. Falls out - not as much as when it's only the pacifier - could just be my daughters tongue pushing it out or something but I think worth mentioning.
i am a mother of 3 kids and this is the 3rd play-yard i have purchased. the 1st two were  both graco winnie the pooh models.  both graco models neither were easy to wash due to the metal bars and the overall way the were both constructed so i had to always wipe it down with wet cloths or baby wipes.<br />the ingenuity washable play yard  has removable fabrics that zip right off so you can throw them in the washing machine whenever you feel like it and this is a great feature! the main play center has a very strong/durable mesh fabric that is safe and strong but not as harsh as previous play centers.<br />it also like many play yards has a changing table but as well comes with a &#34;dream center&#34; with hanging toys so your young infant can have a nap or just amuse themselves for a while. the &#34;dream center&#34; is right next to the music player which features: 5 melodies and 3 nature sounds designed to relax and comfort your baby.<br />it is extremely easy to assemble and once assembled it is easy to pick up and transport with you wherever you may go, to a babysitters to grandma's or a day at the park with friends this is ready for any trip.<br />my baby boy loves this and i'm happy he's happy i would highly recommend it.
before my twins were born, i purchased another brand of bottle, thinking it would be the perfect bottle for them. however, after being born premature with some reflux and colic issues, i was struggling to find a bottle that was the perfect size and also helped prevent air from getting through. i received a 3 pack of these as a baby shower gift and since opening the box, this has been the only brand of bottle i have used! i have purchased several sets of these (in both the blue/clear combination as well as the pink/purple combination) and so far, at 9 months i have yet to have to replace any of the bottles or pieces. i know some people say these bottles have a lot of parts (bottle, stem, rubber &#34;cap&#34; for stem, nipple ring and nipple) however they are all extremely easy to clean (i just put everything in the top rack of the dishwasher with the smaller parts in a smaller basket made for baby items) and you can assemble quickly. after 100+ washes in the dishwasher, they still stand up well. a few bottles have started to &#34;warp&#34; - meaning the bottoms of the bottles have become more rounded vs. flat, but they still stand up on their own. (which we can't expect them to last forever, right?) i highly recommend these bottles!
sometimes it's the small things that are the most impressive. case in point, the glow in the dark feature on this little paci's! i thought it was a &#34;nice idea&#34; when i purchased them, only to realize that the practicality of them with my new little 4 week old newborn is awesome!!! i didn't realize how difficult it was for me to see at night when his paci is in his mouth, or if he's spit it out or pulled it out with his fist while sleeping. now i can quickly see if it's in his mouth. it glows just as bright as the photos show, if it is charged up in bright light (flashlight, cell phone, etc) prior to putting it in the baby's mouth. otherwise, it produces a very dim, low glow. you'd think that it's too low to see, until your eyes adjust to the dark at night, then you can see it clearly. the case they come in are able to have a little water added to the bottom and placed into the microwave to kill all germs on them. i personally like to clean them myself with hot soapy water, but that's just me. and they also have the same nipples as the mam pacifiers that we received in the hospital, which prevents nipple confusion. all around, i really love this little things and will get more if/when we lose either of the two we currently have.
i did a lot of research and this stroller was exactly what i was looking for.  it's extremely light and rides super smooth.  the turning radius is great as well.  i love being able to access the basket from the front and back.  i also love the child's tray can be opened on either the left or right side.  my daughter loves being in it.  another positive is the way it closes.  it actually closes yet remains standing so it's very easy to pick up and put it in my car.  my other maclaren umbrella stroller wold crash to the ground when i tried closing it.    my only negative would be that i can't seem to get my daughter to sit up as much as i like.  since the adjustment for the relining seat is a strap, it won't allow me to pull it tight enough to have her sit up straight.  that makes it difficult for her to get her drink or snacks in the tray.  i also have a bob duallie which i love but it's very bulky and heavy.  this stroller is perfect for quick trips to the store.  i also purchased the [[asin:b005pk1g76 diono buggy buddy stroller organizer, black]] and it works perfectly.  great for holding extra drinks, cell phone, keys, etc.  don't hesitate to buy this stroller!  highly recommend!  and as always the shopping experience with amazon was amazing!
great quality product, solid and very stable/sturdy. it did take me a bit to set it up, i would definitely recommend getting a level to make sure it is straight, otherwise you might have trouble with it closing/opening such as i did. i made some adjustments and it works great now. i actually bought it as a dog gate, not for kids, but it works great and looks great, like i said very stable and it feels like it would hold up really good against quite a bit of force. my concern when i purchased it was if it would hold up to getting pushed, my dog likes to push things open and he is very strong but i have no concern with this after installing it, holds up very well  it comes with sets of screws, long ones and short ones, depending on the type of wall you are mounting it on. also it comes with two strips of paper that has an image of the mounting pieces, to help you with lining it up on the wall and drilling/screwing the holes in the right place. also, it is adjustable with three different lengths when attaching the 2 pieces of the gate together as well as the ends of the gate has pretty long screws that you can adjust as well.  i would most definitely purchase this product again if i needed to and i would recommend it to anyone. great quality product.
Firstly, This Pacifier has a round end on it. So if your baby is not used to this type of pacifier, they might Not like this one.  It is Permanently attached to the stuffed animal, it does not detach for cleaning!  The stuffed animal is lightweight, stuffed with cotton. I like the Wubbanub because it is Easy to Find, no more going crazy trying to find the small pacifier!  Even very young infants can grasp at the animal pacifier, it is amazing to watch them, holding onto the  Wubbanub, thusly holding onto the pacifier!  Somehow it keeps the pacifier in babys mouth, especially while baby is lying down.  At night it is invaluable for a parents good nights sleep; if your baby loves the pacifier!  I've found the perfect way to keep the pacifier clean, just buy the pacifier wipes and use them to keep it clean and sanitized. This Giraffe is Loved so much that one  stays home and  one is even kept in the diaper bag, heaven forbid we loose one!  I really like the Giraffe because it is so easy for little hands to hold onto so many of the little legs. This Wubbanub should be looked over occasionally, just to make sure there are no holes or stuffing coming out, this is Not a Teething Toy!, remember it is, just a pacifier with an attached stuffed animal!<br />.
My son loves this paci.  It is the only kind he will use.  We tried the Soothie brand but he had a hard time keeping it in his mouth.  It was like it was at the wrong angle in his mouth because of the circular shape and it resting against his nose.  I discovered these and thought I'd give them a try.  They worked like a charm.  He has never had an issue keeping these in his mouth because there is nothing pushing against his nose when he sucks, and because of the contoured shape.    Now I will say that it would be nice if the entire pacifier was solid silicone like the Soothise pacifier is.  I had 2 of the Gum Drop pacifiers begin to peel away along the inside where the internal hard plastic form is.  I contacted the seller who directed me to the Manufacturer.  They were more than appologetic and sent replacements and also a return envelope for the damaged pacifiers.  They seemed genuinely shocked that this had happened to 2 of my pacifiers.  Despite this issue with a few of the GumDrop pacifiers, I still think they are an excellent product.  When you manufacture thousands, if not millions, of pacifiers there is bound to be a few defective ones that slip past quality control.  I do not think that should negate the fact that this is an awesome product.
as most new parents, we were faced with the fear and worry of &#34;what if she stops breathing??&#34; our baby was born premature and so this fear was/is very real as we have seen it happen in the nicu...of course, they have monitors to warn them when this is happening...<br />why shouldn't we have the same warning and peace of mind that we can prevent it also? i searched and searched for an answer and stumbled upon safetosleep. i debated for a long time whether or not to purchase this item as its no small price tag but then what price would i pay for the safety/monitoring as offered in the hospital? i read the reviews and jumped the gun. this item says what it does and actually does it! the alarm will go off for her slight movements but that can be fixed in the sensitivity settings, it has warned us of a drop in her breathing, a rise, and when she gets picked up off the mat ( or rolls off later on). all of these are very useful! i love that i can talk to her using the monitor...i love that it tells me the temp of the room because we can mimic the nicu temp...i love the ease of setting it up and using it!!<br />things i would improve are: 1.different alarm sounds for different things. 2. a backlight. 3. longer battery life (lithium?)<br />4. size options
this is our first diaper pail we've ever purchased, but we love it. yes, it's not that large as other reviewers have said, but i like to keep things tidy in my house so we typically take out the diaper trash within 2-3 days. if you fold the dirty diaper and close the velcro flaps over the waste, it is more compact and you can stuff quite a bit of diapers into the pail. when my little one was a newborn, if we got lazy, it would easily store up to 5 days of diapers, but when she got older it went down to about 2-3 days. we used about 7-8 newborn diapers a day and now about 5-6 size 2 or 3 diapers (6 mos old) a day. it does keep the odor in without any issue - some odor will escape but it is transient. i like that fact that i can use this diaper system as a trash can in her room in the future. also, you can use as much or as little of the liner that you want. we've bought refills for the diaper dekor, but we haven't needed to use the refills yet (almost 7 months). it's also easy to change out the diapers and you don't have to touch the diapers at all! great and convenient for those on a budget and don't mind changing out the liners a little more often. i wouldn't want poop in my bedroom over a week anyway (let alone my baby's). it's a keeper for our family.
for our first two children we had a bulky graco. for our third one we wanted a lighter stroller. after doing a lot of research on peg perego, city select, other european upscale strollers as well graco and chicco - we decided to buy britax. the decision was based on reading reviews, and visit to the box and mortar stores to experience the stroller.<br />we were already in love with city select before starting stroller research, but didn't like some of the nuisances with city that are talked about in reviews here at amazon and elsewhere.<br />we found that britax is everything that city select is, with the flaws of cityselect removed. the britax stroller is great and the car seat is safe and sturdy, albeit a little heavy for wife.<br />we also bought the britax stroller organizer for $20 and $6 \\mommy hook\\ to complete our system.<br />our baby girl is now 5 months old, and we have been putting her in the stroller directly without carseat as well. in these 5 months, the stroller has been used in many a visits to mall (smooth floors and tight turns), a full-day visit to a pumpkin farm fest (ruggid terrain and lot of dust), and a week-long visit to disney and sea world parks in orlando. so far we love the stroller and couldn't be happier with the purchase.
I was introduced to this model/brand in the hospital where I came home with 2. Every baby is different and mine took this one immediately after the 2nd day she was born (thank goodness). It is extremely durable and easy to clean. I with either place mine in the microwavable sterilizer I used with bottle parts or wash with hot, soapy water & rinse.<br /><br />My baby has rejected a couple other brands (by flat out spitting them out or I take it as &#34;rejection&#34; when they don't &#34;pacify&#34; her and she keeps fussing). This one always works so when I find something that works baby-product-wise I stick with it!<br /><br />Why I ordered more here on Amazon - quite simply - the small size makes them easy to lose and I have a laborador that I have to be quick about grabbing them if I drop them since she has likened them to one of her toys (sheesh!). So there is no fault of this product - I just care to stockpile these. I keep them in the nursery, in my nightstand drawer, in my diaper bag and in the car.<br /><br />They have 2 good-sized holes where I can easily string a paci-clip through, too. I will for sure re-buy and highly recommend to expectant mothers trying read reviews to determine what to get in advance. This would make my top 5 list of must-haves.
my mom bought me this wipes warmer because my newborn cried during diaper changes. i didn't get it out of the box or set it up for a month because: my baby stopped crying during changes, the thing is way wider than a regular box of wipes, and i really didn't think it was necessary. i finally set it up today, and i'm so glad i did. i don't know why i waited so long.<br />i can get through a diaper change without fully waking up my baby now! what a lifesaver!! until this morning, i was warming wipes in my hands or sticking them on my stomach. if you are like i was, and are thinking wipes warmers are a silly luxury, try sticking a wipe on your stomach at 4am. they're freaking cold!!<br />the wipes don't seem to heat uniformly, but they're still warm. and yes, they do lose some of the heat when you take them out of the container, but they're still warm enough to not shock your little baby's bum.<br />totally worth the extra space it takes up.<br /><br />oh, mine also came with a little plastic container filled with a roll of green baggies, and a refill of the baggies. there was no description of these anywhere, so i can only assume they're for the diaper bag to contain dirty diapers and wipes. but i could be totally wrong, that's just how i've decided to use them.
Our little guy, now 7 months, LOVES his wubbies. He has 3: the giraffe, the monkey, and the puppy, but this is his favorite. We put them in his crib at night and if he wakes up crying, he finds one, puts it in his mouth, and goes back to sleep about 90% of the time completely on his own. He's been able to put them in his own mouth for a couple months now. In the morning, he wakes up and collects all three together and plays with them for about an hour which lets us sleep in, another huge plus :). If he's tired or fussy, his wubs soothe him right away. Because of the little animal attached, he doesn't lose or drop it very easily at all, and it gives him something to hold on to which is very comforting for him. He also loves it for teething now. I am very confident that learning to pick these up on his own and put them in his mouth has really increased his manual dexterity. They wash really easily in the washing machine and you don't even have to stick them in the dryer because they dry so fast. The only downside is if you have pets the hair may stick to the pacifier part, but we don't have this problem. Did I mention we get TONS of compliments on how cute they are? You really can't go wrong with these little guys!!! They are probably my favorite of all our baby items :).
We purchased this pacifier and the Brown Puppy pacifier for my son, along with other plain Phillips Avent Soothie pacifiers.  The WubbaNubs were by far my son's favorites, especially the Puppy (he even had a name for it), but that was probably because it was the first one we bought for him.  Infants look really cute sucking on these pacifiers and you will get a lot of comments.  We live overseas so you don't see these around here and we got asked many times where we bought them.  Before buying this item, I wasn't sure if it would be worth the extra money for these pacifiers vs. the plain Avent Soothies but I think it is well worth the extra money.  Even though these are easier to keep track of than plain pacifiers, we ended up losing a couple of them and replaced them, and some of the plain pacifiers, with the Brown Monkey, another Brown Puppy, and the Turtle.  We purchased others as gifts and have heard nothing but positive things.  One other note....when we weened our son off of his pacifiers, we got him a blanket with a monkey head attached to it (it's cuter than it sounds) to replace his Monkey pacifier.  Did going from the Monkey pacifier to the Monkey blanket make that transition easier?  I don't know...it seemed to us like it did but it's just a single data point.
I wish I had found out about this pacifier earlier for my older sons, they never like any pacifiers, same as my newest baby, until I gave him the Naturautten. I believe it's the softness and shape of the paci that makes it feel like the breast. My baby cries for the paci as soon as he feels full from the breast, that's how much he loves sucking it. It's also a great chew toy for him, when he's not soothing, he likes to take out the paci and chew all around it, the round flap, the ring at the back. Guess the bouncy rubber is so fun to chew on. I wish they would make actual chew toy out of the same material!  I bought two 5 months ago so that I can have a spare, and baby has been using them this whole time. The paci did turn brown, and gets sticky as soon as it dries up, but rinse it in a little water when it sticks and its good to suck on again. That's why I would recommend anyone to buy a couple at least to switch around if one gets dirty/sticky. But there's really no need to replace them just because of this. Even says on their website, this is normal and absolutely no harm to baby to suck on an old paci ~ [...]    I see other review says that it bounce when dropped on the floor which makes it hard to find. I laughed, coz this totally happen to me all the time. Hahaha...
UPDATE: We've used this for about two and a half years and it held up well, functioning as intended, until now. The reason it ripped is both my children decided to hang on it at the same time.<br /><br />I was able to repair it using dental floss and a sewing needle, then covering the sewing with duct tape to deter my little ones from trying to get to the threads.<br /><br />I will replace the broken unit with a new one of the same as soon as possible. We use this gate very heavily (10-20 times a day most days) and I think it's good that it held up this long.<br /><br />Yes, it is loud. Yes, it is possible to get it caught up while it's retracting, but overall, it's a good product. If you have an area where a regular gate just isn't s good option, this is a good alternative.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW: I have no complaints about this product. It's perfect for areas where you don't necessarily need protection all the time, but want the option to have it. We use metal gates for the stairs, and kitchen, but we use this for the bottom of the stairs because out daughter doesn't usually have a chance to climb them without us knowing.<br /><br />It is a little more complicated to operate than a metal swinging gate, but perfect for areas where you don't have to use it all th time.
i'm an avid runner so when we knew we were having a family my task was to find a jogging stroller.  after reviewing all type for months on the internet i finally went with the reebok.  i was able to start running with my daughter when she was three months old because the reebok was one of the only strollers that could recline.  it has a front zip on pocket that catches any toys that are dropped instead of them falling on to the road and it also acts as protection against the sun in the summer and the cold of the winter.  it's nice and compact in the seating area so when out running in the winter with the plastic cover on (included with the stroller), heat loss is minimal.  <br />yes it did pull to one side but it doesn't take a `rocket scientist' to realize how to correct the problem with out reading the instructions.  i'm not a big muscular person and i find it easy to run while controlling the stroller with one hand. <br />i've now had the reebok for just over a year, i run 3 - 4 times a week with my daughter and i'm about to pass the 2000km mark using it for running only, not including any walks we do with it.  i've never had a deflated tire or a bent frame...i don't know what one does to bend the frame!! <br />would and have recommended the reebok, great jogging stroller. <br />
We have several of Avent's 'regular' pacifiers at home, which my daughter likes and uses on a regular basis.  When I purchased these, the glow-in-the-dark feature was not important to me, as I really didn't expect the glow to last for long (c'mon folks, it's glow-in-the-dark - the technology hasn't improved much since 1985...haha).  As other reviewers have noted, the glow really does not last too long after the lights go out.<br /><br />I'm sure most parents who use pacifiers for their babies would agree with me on this - we have pacifiers floating all over the house, but it seems whenever you want one, none can be found.  For this reason, I did like the nighttime pattern on the pacifiers; it helps my husband and I to remember that those are the 'bedtime binkies' and when we find them around the house, to put them back into her bed, so we *always* have a pacifier for bedtime.  Yes, the base of the pacifier is larger than Avent's 'regular' design, but I find that the larger base prevents the pacifiers from falling through the slats on my daughter's crib, which happens to the 'regular' design frequently.  Perfect if she wakes in the night; she can find her binkie and replace it herself - which she does.  I'm really pleased with these, as I have been with all Avent products I have purchased.
excellent carrier. if you're wondering if the extra money is worth it for the organic vs original fabric, yes-it is. it's much softer and less chaff-y when wearing it in warm weather with a tank top or anything sleeveless/shoulderless and you'll feel a lot better about your child gnawing on the strap which is inevitable. this is my third child and i have carried all of them in a variety of different contraptions: original bjorn, sports bjorn, becco -- much prefer this one. we live in nyc and do a lot of walking and this has been the most comfortable on my back and shoulders. it's easy to put on while holding the child which is impossible with the bjorn and fairly easy to move into back holding position without assistance. the pocket is also great for holding your phone and wallet. it poufs out a bit so the items dangle away from your child rather than rubbing against them.<br /><br />i ordered the zen and received the dandelion pattern instead (looks like the sticker barcode on the box was mislabeled) but amazon customer service handled the issue quickly and professionally (am i the only one a little unnerved by the casual tone of some other companies? zappos made an error on an order and sent me an email that literally said, &#34;sorry, man!&#34; not so with amazon and i appreciate that.)
we bought two of these for our nursery because we are expecting twins. the shipping was a little bit of a hassle since this item is not shipped by ups or fedex. amazon uses a different carrier for their large items.<br /><br />the cribs came packaged well and the shipper was very courteous. after unboxing them all the items were all in good order and i did not see any damage. all the pieces were accounted for.<br /><br />i would recommend using a battery powered screwdriver to assemble this. all that is provided is an allen wrench. i would also recommend having someone to help. some of the pieces are hard to assemble with just one person.<br /><br />the assembly went well and quick. all the pieces fit together well and i had not problems at all. the instructions are a big sticker on the base part of the crib. they are a little hard to understand.<br /><br />after the cribs were together they looked amazing! they are very sturdy and well built. the standard crib mattress fit in with no issues. i do like the fact that it has 3 adjustable heights.<br /><br />the only complaint i have is these do have a smell after they come out of the box. they have been together and in the nursery for 3 weeks. they smell is going away. i would definitely recommend putting these together before the baby comes.
When my little one was discharged from her stay in the NICU, the NICU nurses threw together a bag for us with all kinds of stuff from their shelves. Included was about 30 of these. I think I'm good to go on pacifiers for the rest of her infanthood.<br /><br />These little guys are great! We got several other brands of pacifiers at our baby shower, and my daughter rejects anything but these. She's not a huge fan of pacifiers in general, and only wants to take one when she is super, super fussy, or crying while she's waiting to eat. The Soothies are big enough and bold enough in color to find in the middle of the night in the crib, too, which is an extra bonus. They're also really easy to keep clean. I throw mine in the dishwasher. You can also stick your pinky finger in the little hole on the nipple part, and that really seems to be something my daughter likes a lot.<br /><br />With all that said, the best part of all isn't advertised. These pacifiers are translucent, so when you put it in your baby's mouth, you can see the sucking action. It looks a bit like a lamprey, really. It's absolutely absurd and adorable. I never thought I'd find amusement in watching my kid suck on a pacifier, but it's strangely fascinating, and my husband and I both laugh at it every time. She's our little lamprey.
i have tried many, many breast milk storage bags and by far i like honeysuckle bags the best. the quality of the bags are great. thicker plastic, double seal top that has never failed me yet and easy to write on surface. the shape of the bags are perfect for easy pouring and great for freezing flat and stacking. i had trouble with the other bags not having a wide enough opening to pour the milk into, having a weird shape which made freezing them flat not really beneficial since i got rounded frozen popcicles that keeps toppling over when stacked, and flimsy plastic side seals that made worried about them tearing. so far i have not had any leakage or breakage issues with any of the brands i have tried and i'm lucky in that aspect. i've heard and read about many people who have experienced leaking bags which is frustrating since it's very tough on our bodies to make &#34;liquid gold&#34;.<br />i purchased these 50 bags to try along with all the other brands and loved these best and it was the best price per bag as well! i was sad to find out they weren't selling through amazon due to some issue. but i was able to buy it directly from the company in bulk of 600 bags! different design, but still great quality and i'm extremely satisfied! over 800 ounces of &#34;liquid gold&#34; bagged so far ^_^
i couldn't have pumped without these. i'm not well endowed at all, so i quickly realized the standard flange size was nowhere near what i needed. pumping was quite painful the first couple of weeks. the standard flange was taking in my entire aereola and deforming it. after i got these, i was much more comfortable, pumping sped up, and output increased. these were able to last an entire year of pumping.<br />however, pumping never fully emptied everything. i had to hand express the last bit of milk, to make sure output didn't decrease. it took an extra 5 minutes, but i didn't mind. i won't lie--pumping is really hard and impossible without someone to lend a hand with the kiddo since i took an hour each session with three pumpings a day. but i believed in it and wanted to do it, and i'm still glad i was able to reach my goal.<br />they're easily washed along with all the other pump parts. i used a bowl to hold soapy water, since i don't really trust the kitchen sink to be free of salmonella. and to make sure it was dry for the next pumping, i gave it a good shake to get the water out of the outer lip.<br />and as stated by ameda, the lip has a tab in it to prevent a vacuum from forming and making removal difficult. don't worry--the seal is at the base of the flange (where it begins to narrow).
My 4.5 month old has started waking up all through the night looking for her paci.  She is just barely coordinated to get her paci back in about 1/3 of the time (that I see, although she probably finds it sometimes and I don't even know).  Since she has figured out how to roll over, she only sleeps on her belly.  Mam pacifiers are great for belly sleepers because they have a low profile and don't get knocked out of baby's mouth when she turns her head, and they are super light so they stay in easily.  I have sprinkled like 6 pacis around her head at night to increase the odds that she'll find one.  Until now, she had been using the under six month size, but I wanted to get the 6+ size to see what the difference is.  The shield is a bit larger and so is the nipple, and the nipple is more bulbous at the end.  I haven't noticed that she has an easier or harder time keeping them in than the smaller size.  She seems to not care which size I give her.  The glowing is genius.  Only the knob glows, not the shield or nipple, so the glowing part doesn't touch her face.  Makes it a snap for me to find in the night, and I'm hopeful that it helps her find them more often, too!  I held them under the light for like 10 seconds before I put her down, and they were much dimmer but still glowing 12 hours later.
when our little one was born, we set up a pack n play in our room for her to sleep in. unfortunately, she was a picky sleeper and would scream nearly the instant we would put her down. we would then walk over, put a hand on her for a few minutes before she would fall back asleep. and then she would do that over and over again all night. this co-sleeper really saved the day. it was a bit of a pain to put together. we have a queen size bed and the adjustment mechanism is in-between the mattress and the box spring, so we had to adjust the straps, lower the mattress, lift the mattress and readjust the straps, over and over again until it was perfect. a slight redesign to put the adjustment mechanism at either end would make set up much easier.   however, once it was set up, it was fantastic. when she would fuss, i could just put my hand on her. when she lost her pacifier, i could quickly reinsert it. when it was time to breast feed, i could just pick her up. when she was done, i could gently put her down. the co-sleeper made life much better by allowing us to actually sleep without getting out of bed all night to check on our little one. we only really used the co-sleeper for 2 months until she was ready for her pack n play, but our sanity and sleep was completely worth the price of the co-sleeper.
i say never stops cause that's the only complaint i have about this toy. once it starts talking, it continues to give reminders for a while before shutting off. however, i like this toy a lot. it has three different levels. if you place the activity center on the floor off the stand, it plays certain games and tunes with every moving part it has on it. at any age, they can play with this stage cause it has a handle and they can carry it or drag it wherever they go, or just press the buttons on it to make noise. then if it's on the second level in which the activity center is on the stand facing forward and the handle is towards the ground, it plays different tunes. not too many different ones, but there's a slight difference. my boys liked this stage fairly well. they'd get up easily. it was stable for them at that stage. when the activity center was upright, it again played different tunes geared more towards driving instructions like when to stop, be careful, and so on. also this would be the time to unlock the wheels so they can walk around with the toy on the stand. they would pull themselves up on this all the time. they didn't start knocking it over until they were about 14 or 15 months. the boys got this toy when they were about 8 or 9 months and they are still playing with it at 17 months.
i first purchased this toy when my son was about 2 1/2 months old. i was looking for a rattle that his tiny hands could grasp (they are surprisingly hard to find) and i was happy to have stumbled across this one. it was one of the first toys i bought him and i was excited to see his little face light up when he played with it. he is now almost 6 months old and this is still his favorite toy. he now has many other toys, and when i set him down for play time he is surrounded by about 10 other choices. he will always go for this rattle first, even if that means he has to belly scoot over the other ones to get to it. he loves to smack it against himself or on the ground to hear the rattle and since he is teething now he will chew on it too. i love that it travels well due to it's small size and that it cleans up easily. with that being said, the one downside is that when i do clean it a small amount of water will inevitably always get inside the rattle. while it's a little annoying, the water always dries pretty quickly on its own so i'm not worried about rubber ducky syndrome (mildew or mold inside). also, as much as he chews on this toy, i have never noticed any saliva getting through to the inside, just water. therefore, i don't feel it warrants the loss of any stars and my baby would definitely agree!
I am a school nurse and have been using this and the professional level one. It is very accurate. I have found that when you do not watch the instruction CD and read the directions, it will seem that this does not work. It works great, no spit transmission, and it never misses a fever. Folks have to realize that to get an ideal temp, a patient has to wait 15 minutes to get acclimated to the room. If a kid comes in from the cold outside his skin temp will be cool thus a lower temp. Most kids with fever come in red cheeked, red ears, irritable, and lethargic plus other symptoms. I usually recheck only the fevers with a B&D digital under the tongue thermometer (which is consider the most accurate way to test). I would say that 99% of the time the two match. Confounding factors are: did the child have a cold drink after lunch before he came into the office? Is the child dehydrated? Has the child not been fed? Dehydration can raise core temp. Not eating a meal can reduce temp since metabolism is slowed due to no body fuel. Cold drinks cool down the mouth and head. Temp is dynamic and changes throughout the day with one's circadium cycle. Last thoughts, if you have 2 thermometers and one reads normal and the other reads high, which one is right or wrong? There is more to an assessment than temp just saying.
this product comes shipped in this adorable packaging, which would look great in a baby-themed basket.  the blanket is very light-weight and soft.  perfect solution to use in warmer weather, this blanket would be appropriate to drape over an infant carrier or stroller to shield a sleeping baby.  also, because its cotton weave is bigger and breathable, this would work well as a cover while breast feeding.<br /><br />the colors are gender neutral (off white background, charcoal grey lambs with tan noses).  lambs are good for baby boys or baby girls, so this is a great gift for the parents that are waiting &#34;to be surprised&#34;.<br /><br />i like that the size is nearly 4 feet square.  i have not washed this product yet, so i don't know how/if any shrinkage will occur. the packaging does not state it's been prewashed, so i would expect it may get smaller.<br /><br />this blanket is an organic product, made in the usa. that's another plus.<br /><br />i received this product at a discount, in exchange for my review.  that does not mean that i give all products five stars. as an online shopper, i rely heavily on opinions of others when making my purchasing decisions.  products with false reviews only cause disappointment when received by the consumer.  if i don't like a product, it will show in my review.
this product was just released so i have only used it for two days. my baby seems to love it! i have tried other noise machines in the past, however, they usually play the sound on a 5-10 second loop. i can always detect the loop and it drives my crazy. this machine does not do that. the sounds are actually soothing. reminds me of a spa. here is my pro and cons list for this product.<br /><br />pros:<br />-great sounds<br />-love how the mirror has little light-ups on it<br />-soft for the baby<br />-changes colors from blue to green<br />-love the stars effect on the ceiling<br />-easy installation<br /><br />cons:<br />-the stars only cover approx 10sqft of the ceiling. i guess this is just enough to cover the ceiling above the crib but i wish there were more bc my baby looks around.<br />-room must be completely dark to see the stars on the ceiling. this is not an issue at night, but nap time during the day may be an issue<br />-poor speaker placement. the speaker is on the back of the unit. if the unit is attached to a wooden crib, the rails can cover the speaker and cause distortion. this could be resolved by brica by moving the speaker to the top or bottom or the unit.<br /><br />although there are a few cons, i would absolutely recommend this product to anyone looking for a sound machine/projector.
My older son always used Nuk pacifiers, and our baby only likes these. Each was/is totally devoted to their pacis. Having experience with both types, I prefer this kind. Here's why:<br /><br />These are all one piece. The Nuk's would get a little bit of water inside of the nipple when washed/boiled, and over time would get cloudy and gross inside, and little bits of dust/grime would get stuck in the seam between the hard plastic shell and the nipple. These get totally clean and there are no seams or areas for water or grime to collect.<br /><br />These are all the same semi-soft material. Our baby will chew on the edges to help with teething, and if he face-plants while sucking/chewing (which happened a LOT while learning to crawl) there are no hard areas to hurt him. Landing on the edge of a Nuk can hurt a little.<br /><br />The only annoying thing is that these bounce like crazy when dropped. We have hardwood floors through most of the house and they can easily end up 10 feet away if dropped from adult height while holding baby. We probably have one under most pieces of furniture at our house at any given time. So just accept this and buy a bunch so you have backups. On the plus side, my 3-year-old thinks it is fun to go on a &#34;pacifier hunt&#34; and see how many he can find while slithering under furniture.
[[VIDEOID:9754c0461ea0f5471aae69bdf21f5510]] This video is a very quick look (less than 2 minutes) at this camera and its monitor. I include an actual demo of its use in a dark room, stepping outside, and turning the lights off. It works exactly as advertised. The Foscam FBM2307 is NOT meant to be a high end, internet monitoring, SD card recording, remote controlled pan and tilt baby monitor. It has NONE of those features by design. There is no SD slot, there is no USB slot. By design. If you want those features, just look elsewhere. But as an excellent stand-alone baby monitor (or cat monitor, or front desk monitor) this works fine. I found the range to be outstanding - I left it in my office and made it about 200 feet away and down the stairs before the monitor lost contact with the camera (YMMV). Also, the clarity of the video and sound monitoring gave me nothing to complain about. This would be easy to throw in a bag or purse and take with you when you're travelling. It comes with two individual power supplies for the camera (which MUST be plugged in) and the monitor (which has a rechargeable battery and can be used remotely, but CAN be used plugged in). Overall it has a nice, solid feel. I confess to being a fan of budget products which work well. This is spot on in that category.<br /><br />Sample provided.
i ordered a set of the regular spill spoiler caps at the same time as i ordered a set of the sport caps.  i am equally pleased with both, so this review mirrors my comments on the sport caps.<br /><br />i drink nutritional drinks and energy drinks in the car and at home, and have a tendency to be a klutz and spill whatever i am drinking in the car and on the furniture.  when i happened onto the spill spoiler ad, i  ordered a set of the regular caps and a set of the sport caps.<br /><br />up-front, i will say i was very pleased to see a listing of the types and brands of bottles each cap fits.  i didn鈥檛 have to wonder if the cap would fit my particular drink bottle.<br /><br />upon receipt of the caps, i immediately tried them and found they do exactly what the ad says.  unscrew the drink鈥檚 regular cap, screw on the spill spoiler cap, stick in a straw, and you are ready to go.  pull out the straw and the hole closes and your drink doesn鈥檛 spill.  at the end of the day (or whenever), just put the cap into the dishwasher and it is ready to go again.<br /><br />i am elated to have found the spill spoiler.  since i am not only klutzy, but also have been known to lose things, i am going to order another one or two sets of each cap.  they work. i recommend them to anyone who drinks and spills things, and that is everyone.
I purchased this product after using the Phillips Avent Soothie Pacifiers for my little daughter. They are the only pacifiers she has ever taken. It's also the kind they gave her while she was in the NICU at the hospital. I am so glad someone came up with this idea!<br /><br />We love all 3 of these cute animals! The giraffe has cute sewn bubbles in different colors on her, the kitten is nice bright hot pink, and the safari puppy has a cute leopard print underside & knotted tail.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. Cute animals for girls ~ all made of pink!<br />2. Easy to keep track of - easy to see in a dark bedroom at night & also when you are holding the baby, they are much easier to grab as they are falling than a Paci alone<br />3. Stays in better than a Soothie Paci by itself - we often prop the animal on her chest and she seems to love holding on to the soft stuffed animal & can even sometimes push it back into her own mouth (and she's only 10 weeks!)<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. Tedious cleaning - I usually wash them on gentle in the washing machine but worry about my daughter ingesting detergent residue so I usually then wash off the pacifier top with a pacifier wipe<br />2. Falls out - not as much as when it's only the pacifier - could just be my daughters tongue pushing it out or something but I think worth mentioning
the title really says the description...easy simply basic shelf.  i suggest adding some vaseline to the suction cup (and applying it to a completely dry surface) when first \\installing\\ this (and that will basically be your install) - that way you can say with decent certainty that it's not going anywhere for quite some time.<br /><br />one thing it doesn't handle too well are the large pump-style bottles (something like a 32oz bottle) - they tend to just slide around on it & can't seem to find a good spot to hold their weight...but otherwise it works great.  it can hold the weight, it's more of the bottle not resting stably enough for you to use the hand pump.<br /><br />this is designed really only for bathtubs & is not designed to be a raised shelf. there is one suction cup on the bottom (the blue dot you see in the image - that's the top of the suction cup) - it basically just rests on the sides of the tub & the suction cup keeps it in place.<br /><br />not sure why this is an oxo tot item (tot being their toddler/baby line of products) - since it's definitely useful for any bathtub that needs a shelf - i don't see any reason why this is especially useful for those bathing their kids (except maybe the versatility of the front cutout) - but i guess they needed to categorize it somewhere in their line of products.
i love this bottle! my 3 month old breastfed baby is so fussy and refused to drink from our other bottles and instead of trying a bunch of different bottles/nipples i decided to find the highest rated one on amazon and give it a whirl. i was a little worried since the price was so high, but honestly it was worth every penny!! she drank immediately from it and has loved it every time since!!<br /><br />what makes this bottle so great:<br />1. the nipple is large and soft so your baby can latch on to it just like she's at the breast<br />2. it is easy to clean and easy to assemble<br /><br />only downsides:<br />1. the \\air vents\\ have to be in the right place or baby won't be able to get any milk out. easy fix though!<br />2. because the nipple is so big if the bottle isn't held upright (my little one likes to turn her head while she's drinking) than towards the end of the bottle the milk will pool in the side of nipple and not at the tip. also this makes it difficult to see when she is finished. but these are very minor setbacks in an otherwise brilliant design! well worth the fact that my baby will drink happily from it!<br /><br />don't forget: for breastfed babies they say it is best to find a nipple that is most similar to your own. it makes the transition easier!<br /><br />hope it works as well for you as it did for me!
My friend's baby didn't like her Wubbanub (giraffe) so she gave it to me. My baby didn't like it much at first, either. Then, we re-introduced it around 5 months and he LOVED it and stopped using any of his other pacifiers. I think maybe the fact that he was more mobile- able to roll over and almost crawling and so it was easier for him to find it in the crib. I truly believe that this item was what got him to start sleeping through the night because SO many of the night wakes were just that he lost his pacifier.<br /><br />What a previous reviewer had complained about (how the whole thing has to go in the wash) I think is one of the best features. When it's dirty, you just throw the whole thing in the wash and it dries (I just hang it up rather than put in the dryer) within a couple hours.<br /><br />I do suggest having three in rotation. Our daycare already lost one. If we didn't have a back-up, it could have been bad. Oh- and don't pay more than $15. Occasionally, these items (the different animals) will be out of stock and other sellers through Amazon will have some for sale for $30+. Don't worry about it because a) they get back into stock pretty quickly and b) if a baby will take one, chances are he/she'll take whichever other one (duck, giraffe, bull, etc.) We've switched out regularly and there's never been a preference.
after lots of research and wasting so much money on cups looking for a sippy that doesn't spill milk everywhere this one i have to agree is the best in that category!!! i have not able to get my 15 month girls to drink milk from anything but bottles. this has worked pretty good one likes it the other not so much. i will say it just seems very close to a bottle but i just ordered the straw attachment so i am hoping to switch to that soon. i love the color coding for use with twins one gets purple the other pink that would have saved a lot of time keeping soy vs milk separate for my girls.  there is one problem! if you are putting cold milk or water in them they are unbearably cold to hold. the up side of that is the drink is going to stay colder longer. i have ordered the silicone sleeve, i think that will fix the problem rather easily! over all i am very happy with this bottle, i just wish i had tried them sooner instead of the bottles i used.  they are very easy to clean no extra parts to clean. they have many top options nipple, supper, straw, or just a cap. so these could be the only covered containers you ever have to buy from baby to older kids. i suggest looking at their website, it states that other brand nipples can be used and lists the ones that work. also thay are coming out with new colors of silicone sleeves august 2015.
The lamb design is the cutest Wubbanub (Wubs) available. Great color. So precious. Everyone that has seen it LOVES it. My 2 month girl and I refer to it as her &#34;Lamby&#34;. We've been using the Wub since she was 3 weeks since she spits out all other pacis.<br /><br />As all Wubs go, great clever design. Helps keep the paci in place because the plush toy gives it some weight but not too much. If the baby wants to spit it out, she still can. And once baby is old enough they can hold it and snuggle it while they use the paci part...or not. They are so soft.<br /><br />I'm also hoping that because there is an attached plush, it'll be easier to wean her off pacis when it's time.<br /><br />I wished the paci part was removable for washing and changing. I throw the entire Wub a lingerie bag and wash with a load of baby laundry. But I'm not sure how great that is since some of the baby laundry is quite soiled. So after I hang dry, I wash the paci again in the kitchen sink with hot soapy water before use. Also my girl is starting to prefer the more bulbous orthodontic pacis instead of the newborn Avent Soothie used on the Wubs. She might grow out of the &#34;Lamby&#34; if she no longer likes the shape and texture of the attached paci. I bought a Binkibear (you can change out the paci on that one) in case she wants to change but so far she hasn't.
I bought this product because I was so afraid of the seat belt not being tight enough for the infant seat base.  I have used this product since my son was just a few months old.  I loved it.  I never worried about the seat belt again.  I was in a car accident with my child when he was almost 3 years old.  I was still using this product with his forward facing car seat.  My car was totalled (I drove a Saturn)...the only part of the car without damage was the roof & the drivers side...my son's car seat was on the rear passenger side, so he recieved more of the impact than I did being the driver.  I honestly believe that this  product saved him from worse injuries than he recieved.  He came out of the wreck with only scratches on the top of his head.  Even though the Mighty-Tite makes the seat belt tight so that the car seat itself won't slide around, his car seat still fell over & that is what shielded his body & face from the glass.  I don't know how it worked out that way, but if his car seat hadn't fallen to its side, I think that he may have been hurt more.  The Mighty-Tite still worked fine after the wreck, & the seat belt never broke like some of the other reviews say.  My son is now in a booster seat & we don't use the Mighty-Tite anymore, but I am pregnant with my 2nd child, I am definately going to use this product again with this baby.
These are my (and my baby's) favorite pacifiers. I love them because they are natural rubber, made of one piece (so no hidden moisture/mold/bacteria issues) and have the lowered curve to go below the nose. The handle is also super easy for my baby to hold and bends easily in case she falls asleep with it and rolls to the side. It doesn't poke her in the face like others I've used. We also have the Ummy and while it's similar I don't like how big the base is...it covers too much of my baby's face for my comfort, despite the holes in it. It's also harder to figure out which way is 'up' when it's dark and I'm trying to quickly put the pacifier in so she can fall back asleep...having the dipped curve in the base makes it to much easier. Since the whole thing is rubber my now teething baby likes to gum the entire thing when she's not using it for its intended purpose. It's kind of funny to watch.  I was at Whole Foods the other day and saw the Eco Piggy, which I almost bought to try but didn't based on the reviews of the bulb part being huge. So I took it out to look at it and sure enough, it's massive! Unless you have a mammoth sized baby I'd skip that one. We're both happy with the Natursutten so I'm sticking to this one.  For those who have complained about the rubber smell/taste...just wash and sterilize it a couple of times and that goes away.
This was the best thing I received for my shower.  First of all, I used it immediately on myself after coming home from the hospital.  I used it to sit on to take the pressure off of my stitched area.  I could sit on the couch, in the bed and at the kitchen table without needing any medication..THANKS BOPPY!!  As for my son, I use it for him to sleep on while I'm doing housework.  I prop it on the couch and lay him in the middle on his side, which adjusts to the perfect size for him.  He sleeps like a BABY!  Next, I use it when I feed him.  I breastfed and went to bottles later.  It was/is perfect for both.    I use it to lay him it after he eats so I can talk to him and he can explore the world.    I use it sometimes when he is doing tummy time.    I use it for my nieces so they can hold him without having to wear their arms down since they are only 5 and 7.  I have several more, but those are the main points.  I would buy it over and over again if anything ever happened to my Boppy.    Also, I wash the slip cover many times, and it is standing strong.  I have only had to wash the pillow a few times, but it still looks brand new.  BOPPY GETS MY CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT VOTE...A+++++++++++++  ***UPDATE...It also helped with my son sitting up.  I would place it around him so he wouldn't get hurt if he would fall over.  It keeps going and going and going...
my daugher is 26 months old and still sleeps in her crib (which apparently is really unusual).  we had the traditional graco pack n play when she was younger to use while traveling.  since she's grown to 34 inches we've tried a tent, air mattress, etc only to have a rotten time on vacation because she wasn't sleeping well.  for our upcoming beach trip we planned to literally take apart her crib at our home and bring it with us!  enter the joovy playard.  as you know, a child as tall as my daughter doesn't fit in a regular sized pack n play.  but with the joovy, she has plenty of room.  i debated between the joovy room 2 ultralight but it is a square foot smaller and since every inch counts with us, we went with this one and i'm so glad i did.  she can lay side to side or diagonally if she wants more space.  the sides are not super tall (compared to a child her age) but she doesn't try to climb out.  i think she likes the comforting boundaries she is used to with the crib.  we are expecting another little one in july and this is the only pack n play we will need.  when the new baby is small, it can be used as a playard or sleeping area and will definitely last until their twos if needed.  if i had to do it all over again, i would just buy the joovy.  yeah, it's heavy but so is our other pack n play and it's not nearly as big.  great buy!  thanks joovy!
quick summary:<br />* great quality material and soft blanket<br />* fits perfectly on car seats and allows baby to be covered/uncovered easily<br />* also functions as a high chair cover, stroller blanket, and shopping cart cover<br />* highly recommended<br /><br />detailed review:<br /><br />we previously had used a regular blanket to cover the car seat when baby was sleeping and it would always either fall off, leave little air flow, or be too small.  when we received the babee covee blanket, i was more than a little skeptical.  all-in-one items tend to be a jack of all trades, master of none.  but was i wrong.<br /><br />the quality of the blanket is fantastic.  it's soft and comfortable and any child would love it just as a regular blanket.  but the stellar part is the design.  it has perforations and holes to attach perfectly on a car seat and to be folded over when you want it more open and to come down when you want some peace and quiet for your baby.  like many great products, it just works well.<br /><br />no longer do we search for other blankets or worry about too thin/too thick blankets for the weather.  the babee covee works so well it never leaves the car seat, except when we also use it as a stroller blanket.  in the future, we look forward to using it as a high chair cover, shopping cart cover and more.<br /><br />highly recommended.
WubbaNubs are hands down my daughter's favorite pacifiers. She is 3 months and she is able to grab onto the stuffed kitten and put the paci back in her mouth - a task she hasn't quite mastered yet with her traditional pacifiers. She was also able to grab onto the stuffed part from a pretty early age. When she was a newborn, I was able to swaddle in her Wubba so that she didn't &#34;lose it.&#34;<br /><br />The pacifier part of the Wubba is an Avent Soothie, which is approved for use with babies under 6 months. I love that the WubbaNub collection uses a well known and respected pacifier manufacturer, since that is the part that goes in my child's mouth. The stuffed animal part is similar to a beanie baby. It is very soft, not too big, and not too heavy - perfect for an infant to handle.<br /><br />It is also important to note that the Wubba's wash nicely. We have the Tabby Kitten, Giraffe, and Red Dog and all of them have been in the wash several times by now. They come out nice and clean and looking like new. I am sure that as my child grows and is more mobile that they will see heavier use and show some signs of aging, but so far I am very please with the quality on this item and it is used daily.<br /><br />My daughter loves them so much that I know I will not only be buying more of them for her, but I will also be giving these to my expecting friends.
As a parent in a complex parenting scenario, I have limited interaction with my six month old daughter. If she is upset for any significant length of time our weekly play time is cut short. As such, it is very important to have a happy baby girl when we play... Right now she is very painfully teething, and it was very difficult to sooth her enough to be able to spend quality time together. Nothing seemed to work for any period of time. I picked up pair of these pacifiers (They had no pink ones, so she got blue, the Others take your gender stereotypes), and it makes our play time one hundred percent more enjoyable. She will start to fuss, and when given one of these pacifiers she will happily suck for a few seconds before discovering that the outside edges it are a hard enough silicone to soothe her sore gums without being too hard and hurting her mouth, as many other teething toys are for her. She then proceeds to contently chew on the outer rim of what I suppose is the guard portion of the pacifier, until she becomes distracted and begins moving on to other toys. But before long, her gums start to hurt again, and she begins searching for it. Once found it is snatched up and back in her maw being chewed with a ferocity that is rarely seen in Kodiak Grizzly bears. I am extremely happy with this product. I am sure it works well as a traditional pacifier too. . .
i have had 3 children and multiple car seats for each of them. this is one of my favorites.<br />i absolutely love that the base detaches from the carried. it makes it so much easier to take baby in and out of the car.<br />it's also a nice feature to lift it out and put it right onto a shopping cart or a carrier stroller.<br />i also love that you can purchase an extra base for a second vehicle. we did with one other model. it saved a lot of time and frustration. you might be thinking, &#34;you could just move the base&#34; and you would be correct. however, sometimes your spouse takes off with the vehicle and you just don't think ahead of time to remove the carrier base. then, say baby gets sick (which has happened) and you have to get to the drs office right away. problem is that dad has the seat base in his vehicle. complications ensue.<br />the extra pad included for newborns and preemies is wonderful. it's so frustrating to try and carry a newborn with a floppy head in a standard sized carrier. this eliminated the need to purchase an extra progressive head support set.<br />the colors are more vibrant than they look in the picture. it looks clean and crisp. very modern and neither too masculine nor feminine (not that baby really cares).<br />the handle adjusts up and down easily as does the sun cover to shade baby outside.<br />overall: love, love and love!
These are very nice pacifiers, binkies, or a &#34;hush-hushies&#34; as we call them.<br />We received the clear set which is perfect because they are gender neutral. I wasn't entirely sure which color would arrive but these are the ones I wanted.<br />The shape is ideal because as a BF mom it's important that it be very similar in shape and size for an easy transition back and forth. Our babies were always very picky about the shape, each one taking to different kinds. The first child only took the nipples that were flat on one side, while the second preferred the ones which are not, but rather like these - round all the way around. They are also long enough that they can stay in easy but still bulbous. These are thinner at the base than they are at the tip, unlike the hospital issued ones which are the same size all the way from base to bulb. Those tend to pop straight out of the babies mouth where these stay in and are a more natural fit for them. They are the litle handles to attach to a ribbon holder so they stay within reach and being clear they will never chip or peel like some of the plastic ones. The silicone material is easy to clean and disinfect and I would definitely recommend these as a gift or necessity buy for another little one.<br />I purchased this set at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review and all opinions expressed are my own.
super lame pun, i know.<br /><br />okay, so i started out using rockin' green hard rock when i first started cloth diapering, due to the extremely hard water in our area.  a very kind person bought it for me off of my registry.  when i ran out, i started using all free & clear, because i had read that people with my type of water were having success with it, and we didn't have a whole lot of money to spend on nice detergents.  i'm not sure if the all free & clear just wasn't cutting it, or if perhaps i wasn't using enough, but i certainly know that i didn't have detergent buildup, but my diapers all of a sudden got super funky, which they had never been before.  i have a feeling the funk came in with some used diapers that i got, but i just couldn't get rid of it!  so i broke down and bought some rockin' green again.  and what do you know?  i am getting rid of the odor problem!  it wasn't completely fool proof, because i've had to adjust the amount and the rinses several times to figure it out, but we are getting there.  yay for not being punched in the face by stench when taking out the diaper pail!!!  thank you, rockin' green!<br /><br />also...  i have a very sensitive baby, and the scent doesn't seem to bother him.  however, i can't even smell it at all by the time i take my diapers out of the dryer, :( so why even bother getting a scented detergent?  just a thought.
this was some of the best money i spent on baby toys!  my daughter used this from a few weeks old until she was sitting up and crawling.  the mat is now put away, but the toys are still played with.  the star is amazing! i don't know what it is about it, but she loves.  as a baby, she would just lay there and smile and coo at it.  as a toddler, she loves watching the light flashing and listening to the music.  my 3 and 5 year old will snitch it from her and play with it.  i put the star on the carseat when we were out, the pack and play to soothe her to sleep away from home. she is 15 months and still walks around playing with it.  the music is soothing and enjoyable to listen to and not too loud.  the mat is fairly sturdy and so vibrant and colorful.  tummy time was spent propped up a little bit with her starting at the mirror and grabbing the stuff on the mat.  the other toys are also exciting for her and she still plays with them, too, especially the teething toy.<br /><br />i bought this for my twin nephews as well.  one loves it as well and with lay there grabbing at the toys, but the other one doesn't like to be stuck there.<br /><br />this is so well worth getting.  it folds up to nothing to store away.  i would slide it behind a chair, the swing, or the couch when she wasn't playing with it. it is the most attractive of any i have looked at.  definitely recommend.
i have a 7 month old, he has been teething since 3 months old but just started cutting a tooth this week. he started refusing a pacifier since 2 months old so i was a little weary about purchasing this but gave it a go. he absolutely loves it. he is chewing on it while on my lap as i type this review. the tooth that is coming in has been hurting him very badly as you can imagine so he's been real angry the last few days. this teether is perfect for him though, it fits just right in his mouth and his hand. i supervise when he chews on anything but i don't see this coming apart. if you're worried then supervise your child while he has it. oh and i didn't buy this online i bought it from toys r us. not to mention it is bpa free, 100% silicone, and can be frozen. the package actually states to use under adult supervision, to replace every month or two, and to inspect it before each use and dispose of immediately if damaged. for those trying to decide whether to buy or not and haven't read the 1 star reviews but just see that there are 20+ one star reviews- most of the one star reviews are either because their child doesn't like it or it is too big for their childs mouth. as with anything, every child is going to have a different opinion. my picky little boy who hates pacifiers loves it and there are also other picky little babies who hate pacifiers who also hate this teether.
Definitely worth the splurge on binkies!!!!  I received these and was surprised to see that they came with a case for each binkie.  It was perfect timing since we were headed out of the house.  I did a quick wash and sanitize, put the covers back on and threw them in my purse...waiting for that first wail from one of my littles on the way to our destination.<br /><br />These binkies are very well made, extremely sturdy and seem that they will last a very long time, even with the bite and wear that babiestoddlers can do.  I absolutely love the &#34;handle&#34; that hangs down from the front so that the binkie can be easy to grab, hold, carry - without having to touch the whole thing (for those germaphobes like muah).<br /><br />The plastic is almost a clearish color, which makes the entertainment factor of these binkies awesome since most of what you see is just the 'stach.  Be prepared to have your camera out the first time you use them.  Your kids will wonder why you are laughing and giggling like a child, and they will be stone cold serious as they suck away wondering what is so funny.  Pictures to last a lifetime.<br /><br />I coincidentally purchased stickers for my youngest that says &#34;If you Mustache, I am X months old&#34;.  Well guess what, guess what is going to accompany those monthly pictures?<br /><br />I love these binkies and would recommend them to anyone
i had heard about this teething necklace from a blog i follow. it caught my attention as i loved the color combos as well as how each &#34;gem&#34; was cut so it did not resemble a circle.<br />when i received the necklace it came in a sealed bag. i honestly liked that as it made me feel better about handling of it prior to getting to me. i opened the bag and did a quick wash with it as i do with any toy my son will end up chewing (within means). i let it dry the rest of the day.<br />on the next day of receiving the necklace i pit it on in the morning. oh wow, my son was so amused by it. at first he kept pulling on it ( i will say the necklace came to about my breasts below) then i think a light switch turned on as he began to out it in his mouth (sure what baby does not put items in their mouth).<br />i believe although i can not have him verbally tell me but he enjoyed this teething necklace. i too enjoyed the colors and i think once he would grows this phase may continue to wear it as it is a very nice statement piece.<br />i do like the pricing on the necklace. i chose this one due to the colors but have to say it was one of the lower priced ones. i have seen necklaces doubled if bot tripled what these necklaces are running.<br />overall, great product and i have already told friends about them. i am thinking about getting some as gifts for two friends who are expecting.
i knew i needed to buy one, but i had been putting it off for a long time. i just wasn't sure i was ready to commit to filling it day in and day out. and what if i didn't like it? i knew i wouldn't send it back and it would just sit in the basement collecting dust next to my ab lounger and thigh master. but, then one day i looked in the mirror and i didn't like what i was seeing. my skin was dry, my eyes red and my hair looked like i stuck my finger into an electrical socket. the final straw happened later that day when i bent down to pet my cat and the shock from the static electricity nearly killed my dear muffin! that was the moment i decided to take the plunge and plunge i did. i got right on amazon and ordered myself the safety 1st ultrasonic 360 humidifier in blue bc i knew if i stuck with it each day that there would be a special man in my life eventually and i wanted him to not only accept my safety 1st humidifier but to grow to love it. it was not long before things started turning around for me. no more flaking skin and fly away hair. and men who never gave me a second glance started saying, &#34;good morning&#34; in the elevator at work. i'm happy to report that 11 months later, my life has completely changed...for the better! i'm now married and we're expecting our first child...a boy...and yes, the safety 1st ultrasonic 360 humidifier will be on our baby registry!
i took a gamble with bob car seat adapter for britax because bob doesn't make an adapter for baby trend car seat (i specifically have a flex-loc baby trend).  i couldn't even find anywhere on the internet that had a solution for this (other than buying a graco).  i love our baby trend car seat and already had it from our first child.  i didn't want to purchase something else.<br /><br />i tried some of the adapters at toys 'r' us and none of them worked.  i tried the graco, peg perego, and even the britax with a baby trend car seat.  none of them worked.  the baby trend car seat wouldn't attach at all to the graco or the peg perego adapters.  on the britax adapter, the baby trend could sit on it but didn't snap in and any weight on the front of the car seat would flip it right off.<br /><br />after searching long and hard on the internet without finding any solutions (other than buying a different car seat).  i found the britax infant carrier to stroller adapter strap.  it is super simple!  just a strap, a buckle and some d-rings.  wrap the straps around the metal pins in the britax car seat adapter and the straps can buckle the baby trend car seat in securely!  it's perfect!  very secure.<br /><br />i do have one confession.  the baby to go in this isn't born yet.  i will update this review once i have some time with the baby in it.  though, i don't see many issues.<br /><br />good luck!
By the time I had my second child I was soberly aware of the dangers of BPA and many other plastics, so I sought out a natural rubber pacifier.  After a couple of duds, we found this.  It's great! My daughter is 18 months and still uses the small rounded size.<br /><br />First and foremost, it had to be safe.  And this is, in many different ways.  Made from natural rubber and oils, I am not concerned about contaminating plastics.  The shape is awesome; it cleans up easily and has no cracks for bacteria to hide when cleaning and sterilizing.  When it first comes out of the box, it is oily.  As others have mentioned, after you wash for the first time, instructions say to boil for a few minutes.  Let it cool and you'll see the oils have been tamed.<br /><br />My daughter loves this paci.  We once ran out of them after I noticed a crack on the side of the nipple (my fault - I let it go much longer than the recommended 6 weeks between replacement).  That was a very long a night.  I tried a few chemical laden replacements until I could get a new shipment in to no avail.<br /><br />All that being said, these are expensive.  And the cost doubles when you realize that you are supposed to replace them every 6 weeks or so.  Much longer than that and the pacifiers start to harden.  But for all the benefits, I will continue to use these and have some peace of mind knowing I am using the safest product.
We got a green one from the hospital and our baby loves it. We figure we should just stick with what we have instead of experimenting. We found a similar-looking one by Avent but they weren't the same. Thank goodness Amazon has these. They are exactly the same as the one we got from the hospital except the color but the engraving on the pacifier is all the same. The color for the blue ones is actually much lighter in person than in the picture -- more of a transparent grayish light blue; very pretty though.<br /><br />I personally like how it's one piece so I don't have to worry about loose pieces coming off -- choking hazard. The pacifier is really soft. I know they make harder ones for teethers but these are the softer ones for newborns and non-teething babies. It's very easy to clean and long-lasting. We're actually still using the green one we got from the hospital but having spares make it easier if I have to clean them then I don't have to worry about not having a pacifier available if it's being sterilized. I sterilizes them in boiling water and they stand up to the heat very well.<br /><br />These pacifiers does tend to get stuff like lint and hair stuck on them because of their sticky-ish surface. I don't use napkins or cloths with lots of fiber to wipe them otherwise they get fury. Most of the time I just run it through warm-hot water and maybe scrub it a little with my hands then let it air dry.
After an extensive amount of time (most would consider it overkill) researching lightweight strollers, I decided on this one. We needed a stroller that would travel well without sacrificing all features, like most umbrella strollers. Our usual stroller is a Britax b ready, so this is a huge difference.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Assembly was easy- all wheels come unattached, as well as the umbrella.<br />The recline option is easy to work, no different really than tightening the bottom of a coat.<br />Handles are comfortable to hold and seem to be a perfect height (5'8&#34;). I suspect others that will use it that are much taller will be comfortable as well.<br />The cup holder! There is a storage sack/built in cup holder affixed to the top<br />Large umbrella with matching dot trim covers significant area<br />Storage basket seems large enough to hold a diaper bag and coat<br /><br />No Cons as of yet.<br /><br />I second that this is the same as the Ignite stroller by the First Years. I gave significant consideration to purchasing that instead, but the brand is really a moot point for this to me. The product registration form even references that this is an Ignite model. Price point was about $15 less to go with this model vs the Ignite.<br /><br />Lastly, the colors are much more muted than pictured- I was concerned that the stroller looked girly, but honestly the colors are gender neutral. Highly recommend.
We got our Soothie 2-pack today, while my son was napping.  I gave him one as he was getting ready to head down for his next nap.  It took a little work to get him to hang onto it, as he's been used to more traditionally shaped pacifiers (he's 11 weeks old), but he caught on fairly fast, and the next time he went to nurse I noticed that he was taking a deeper latch already!  I had some supply problems early on, so anything that encourages good latching and better milk transfer is okay by me.    I've noticed some reviews criticizing this pacifier for being a potential choking hazard.  Let me say that there is a degree of personal responsibility here.  These are not the hard plastic pacifiers most people are used to... they are medical grade silicone, made for newborns.  The whole thing is softer, more flexible, and yes, that means that you have to watch your baby to make sure he can't fit the whole thing into his mouth, because babies try that.  On the wrapper it says not to leave your baby alone with a pacifier (any pacifier), and I imagine that it's for precisely this reason.  If your child can fit the whole Soothie into his/her mouth, it's too small and you need to buy a binky that is appropriately sized for your child.    As for the suckerfish look... I think it's hilariously cute.    Update 2/19/12 - Still loving the Soothie, still refusing any and all other binkies.  Longer review on my blog:    [...]
i ordered this because my toddler started getting sweaty back as it became summer. i wanted something natural against his skin since we live in an urban area and take him in a stroller on the metro everyday to daycare. all the other stroller liners out there.... well, there were mixed reviews and so i decided to go for wool. a bit counter intuitive because i think of wool as keeping me warm. but it has really worked at wicking moisture! he doesn't get 'sweaty back' any longer and seems overall more comfortable in his stroller. he is still \\warm\\ when we take him out, but that is very different than sweaty, in my book.<br /><br />i am buying another one to go in his car seat, which is the next problem. we don't use our car too much, but somehow the straps in our stroller make it not as convenient to switch the liner back and forth (fault of the stroller, not the liner although if the liner openings were constructed differently i guess you could slip it off).<br /><br />anyway, i'm sooo happy about the product, i'll just suck it up and buy another one (it obviously isn't inexpensive). but the quality is great and extremely well made. i bought a wool mattress topper for winter and this is 10x nicer in texture and craftsmanship. we actually started calling it \\wooly\\ as though it was a stuffed animal. ha.<br /><br />i wanted to let other parents know since there weren't any reviews on this product! love it!
these baby girl headbands with chiffon flowers have nice stretchy bands to accommodate girls up to age 10 per the manufacturer.  the bands fit my 9 y/o granddaughter without any discomfort, and she adores them. i'd say that boho style is an excellent description for these headbands. the flowers petals aren't smoothly cut, which actually gives them more volume and a much more natural look than if they had been cut smoothly. there are  some stray bits of hot glue residue here & there to pick off, but not too much and it's easy to pick off if it's bothersome.  some of the headband colors aren't the exact same shade as the flower on them, which is sort of weird, but the colors don't actually clash and it lends to the whole nonchalant boho/natural  style thing these have going on.<br /><br />the price of these headbands seems to make them a good value compared to prices i've seen for other similar headbands, and most important of all, my granddaughter didn't care if the shades were a bit different, or if they had a tiny touch of glue to a petal here or there. she thinks they're adorable just like they are and is looking forward to matching the flowers up with different outfits she owns! i took a picture of her happily trying on the pink headband, and you can see her eyes sparkling with delight, so i think the verdict is in - little girls love these!<br /><br />headbands provided for evaluation and review purposes.
I wasn't going to let my baby have pacifiers, maybe because where I'm from they're called &#34;dummies&#34;. Anyway, all that changed 3 days after she was born and was screaming non-stop. My mother-in-law sat me down and said &#34;now I know you don't want to use pacifiers but babies need to suck and if you don't want to breastfeed non-stop they'll help... plus they use them in the neo-natal unit at Stanford Hospital so how bad can they be?&#34;<br /><br />At my wit's end and in tears I begged her to get some for me. She returned with 3 kinds (not these, because they're not for newborns). My daughter liked the soft Nuk ones the best, but when she turned 6 months old they were too small for her so I took myself off to the store to find the same, but larger. They don't exist, so flexing my super scientific muscle I endeavored to pick the one that was closest. These were them. The colored bit is hard plastic to keep the shape, but that piece is completely covered in soft silicone. It took my daughter about a day to get used to them and the work wonders for calming her.<br /><br />You set so many rules for yourself as a parent, always with the best of intentions, but you have to be ready to flex and this is one I'm glad we broke. Nap times and I-hate-my-carseat-and-just-want-to-scream times are much easier with these.  We're about to wean her off them, but am so glad we found them when our other ones got too small.

LOVE this Wubbanub! Got one as a baby gift and frankly thought it was kind of dumb. I mean, if you want a pacifier and a little stuffed animal, why do they need to be stuck together?!? And then when our son still wasn't really hooked on any particular pacifier after the first couple weeks, and after one long evening of paci-spitting and fussing, I figured we might as well try the Wubbanub. Our son loved it pretty much instantly! And the genius design of that stuffed animal meant the paci couldn't drop out of his mouth and get stuck under his neck/head. It rested perfectly on his chest while he was tiny and stayed close and easy to grab when he was a little bigger. And while I fully expected him to abandon it by the time he was crawling, he loves that thing still! It's lightweight enough that he never minded it dangling from his mouth as he became mobile. He's over 20 months now (entering the territory of restricting it to the crib, car, and emotional moments), but it's easy for us to grab and hang onto with a toddler on the go. With him on my hip and the paci in his mouth, the giraffe is long enough that I can hook a leg or tail between my fingers in case he jettisons the thing. I'm actually ordering a new one because he finally chewed a hole in his and I don't have the heart to take it away. Can't believe I'm buying a Wubbanub for my toddler, but a lovey is a lovey for a reason, and he sure does love this giraffe.
i love how light weight this is.  and so many compartments to organize your stuff.  i use one of their smaller bags that comes with the bag as my wallet or clutch...i've over-used it to the point that the loop on the side broke off at the seams.  either way, it's great to grab and go if you're just dropping off the bag with a care-taker or throwing it back in and not carrying too many bags around when all you need is the diaper bag with your necessities in a smaller pouch.  love the insulated bag too.  keep all my ready to go formula bottles and nipples in there.  outside side pockets great for sanitizers, front pockets great for quick easy to reach and find wipes (hand and face wipes, pacifier wipes, and dry kleenex tissues).  other front pocket for my sunglasses, keys and phone.  my husband thinks i'm crazy for carrying a heavy bag, but i think it's already light weight to begin with so all the stuff i'm packing in are the items &#34;necessary&#34; to the added weight.  like water bottles for those powder formulas as my back up feedings (that's in one of the inside side mesh pockets).  extra change of clothes, extra mesh pockets for diapers and bibs and burp cloths.  the inside is so roomy, you can pack a loose blanket and toy blanket and other toys in there.  definitely a great deal for the price below $100.  would definitely recommend if you're like me into organizing and carry every essential item for your baby.
we bought roan rocco in 2012. always had wanted a pram for our baby so she could stretch and be really comfortable. my husband and i spent many hours &#34;test driving&#34; different carriages sold by baby stores. unfortunately, here in the us, as strange as it sounds, the choices are very limited. the stores either sell carseat-type carriages or trendy european carriages that are also built for the convenience of the parents and do not seem to have enough room for the baby.<br />roan rocco pram had everything we'd been looking for, and a very reasonable price. i was somewhat skeptical about buying online though. to my pleasant surprise, the pram arrived the same week we ordered it. it looked awesome, much better than it did in the picture. the bassinets (both of'em) were huge and the built quality was top notch. we now have the 2nd bassinet on and it's just as roomy as the first one. really really happy with our stroller. we've had it for over a year now and it gets complemented almost every day. it's extremely comfortable for the baby, safe, great looking and unique. what's not to like?!!<br />a special note about the dasalika. two weeks ago i needed an extra part for the stroller. i located my amazon order from 2012 and sent a message to the seller. oleg called me in three hours after i hit the &#34;send&#34; button!!!! a week after, the extra part arrived. superb product + superb service = very happy customers!!!!
We have used the WubbaNub pacifier since the day our baby girl was born and she took to it immediately. Because she is a breastfed baby, we weren't sure if a pacifier would hinder her ability to breastfeed properly. We gave her the WubbaNub anyways, it was too cute not to try! She has never had &#34;nipple confusion&#34;. She enjoyed her &#34;Mr. Binks&#34; as well lovingly call it, and it has become her comfort item. I've listed the pro's and con's below.<br /><br />PROS:<br />-The stuffed animal attached to the pacifier keeps it from getting lost when it falls out of baby's mouth. Many a times, I've been driving when it falls out of the baby's mouth and I can easily reach back and find it because of the stuffed animal being attached.<br />-Baby &#34;pets&#34; the animal during sleep transitions to sooth herself to sleep<br />-Lays flat on baby's chest, keeping it in their mouth even when they are newborn and don't have great &#34;suction&#34; yet<br />-Many different stuffed animal options and they are all so cute<br />-difficult to lose because of the size (they don't fall out and disappear under the couch!)<br /><br />CONS:<br />-Difficult to wash just the pacifier<br />-Wish the pacifier was detachable so that it could be swapped out for the different stages<br /><br />Overall, our baby has loved this pacifier from day one. We don't have many complaints and I love that we get so many compliments on how cute it is!
I honestly don't know how I made it through my first two kids without one of these!! They are great for so many reasons: 1. They are easy to find, and don't get lost - I have exclusively used one binky for the last 5 months compared to the dozens I had gone through with my other two kids by the same time, saving $$ as well! (They are also much easier to find than just a single little binky in the dark or in the car!) 2. My baby has learned how to put his own binky in his mouth MONTHS earlier than my others did. Since it is so much bigger - much less dexterity and coordination is necessary to get it in his own mouth! 3. It STAYS in place. This is the kicker for me. Especially as a newborn, before they really have the suction power to keep their binky in - when they spit out their bink half-way, it doesn't fall out completely = less trips for mom and dad to put it back in their mouth! 4. Although this is just anticipation, when it's time to wean off of the binky, I think it will be much easier to just cut off the actual binky and let them play with the animal for comfort. Hopefully it will be an easier transition by letting them keep some of what they have become attached to.<br /><br />After 5 months of constant use, our binky is starting to tear where it is stitched to the animal. Honestly, this does not concern me at all given the fact that we use it all the time. If I only need one binky every 5-6 months, I'm one happy mama!
i truly wish i had these diapers when my daughter was born to see if they really live up to a 'one size' reputation.  as it is, i first got them when she was 11lbs and i'm happy to say i was extremely happy with the fit (and the different adjustments available to the fit).  the inserts were a little daunting but they are very intuitive - snap smallest setting with most padding in the middle for a girl.  i then decided to try the diapers on my (just turned) 2 year old who needs the rise of a large diaper and is a heavy wetter.  i snapped in both inserts and the 'mini' pad to give maximum up front absorbancy.  i didn't hold out much hope of a leak free experience as the inserts are so thin.  4 hours later i removed the wet diaper and everything outside of the diaper was dry.  i was amazed as i had only washed the diaper once and the bamboo was no where near maximum absorbancy.  it fits nice and trim and i love the fluffy soft outer fabric.  i like the flexibility of adjusting the inserts to suit both an infant and a toddler.  i also like that you can use the outer shell as a cover or just snap in a fresh liner if the shell is still dry.  i will be buying the extra insert sets that are sold separately.    my one wish was for this diaper to be not suedecloth (i had really bad experiences with bg3 suedecloth and ds had bad reactions to it).  i have had no such experience with this diaper so i can only assume the suedecloth is different.
i actually got this for myself and have been using it for about a week now.  i had nasal surgery and have not been able to blow my nose yet for 2 weeks.  i am able to use a nasal spray for congestion and also saline spray, and gently blow, and got permission to use a baby aspirator, so i came on amazon and found this, figuring this would be a much better choice than the bulb type i used on my kids when they were babies.  i haven't been disappointed.<br /><br />this little gem is great.  it's quick & easy to put together, take apart, rinse, wash, etc.  it is a little tricky to use on yourself, but very doable lol.  if your mucus is thick and you have to suck really hard, it is possible to suck some of what's in the little cup through the tubing, but it is very obvious if this happens, so it doesn't get far.  it's quick and easy to take the tube off, rinse it out & put it back together.  i even dried the tubing out with my hair dryer.<br /><br />the one thing i think could be better is the tip could be a little more rounded, as even though it is a very soft rubber, when your nasal passages are raw and/or sore, the slightest bit of edge is painful and/or uncomfortable.  it hurts a bit for me to let it touch, but this aspirator has been great for me, being unable to blow my nose, and having bad allergies, i just have to be sure not to go in too far.  also be careful which part you're putting in your mouth if you're using it on yourself ;)
this set of crib bedding makes a fabulous gift presentation for baby showers and parents to be. though i was provided a sample for my own use, when it arrived i felt like i was unwrapping a present. it is encased in a simple clear square bag and the blanket is wrapped around a box with the other items folded within a second box. the book sits in a little pocket so it is visible from the exterior of the case, and makes it look that much more like a full gift set. the screenprinted comforter is like a miniature quilt and i really love the bold, beautiful design of the african dream one.<br /><br />the comforter is extremely comfortable and was almost immediately co-opted by my cat. however, once we extracted the cat, my toddler loved it too. he snuggled down and had no trouble falling asleep on it. i like that the crib sheet and the crib skirt go so well together, yet the colors of both are neutral enough to where they go with the other cream, pale tan, and gray sheets that i already own.<br /><br />the stuffed animal is more like a pillow than it is something to snuggle with, or it can make a great decorative accent on a shelf nearby. most of the sets that i have found in local stores have a disney theme or some other tacky appearance that i would not dream of purchasing for somebody else as a gift. these, by contrast, make such a strong presentation that i would absolutely feel confident getting any of these sets as a baby shower gift.
i laugh at all my friends who buy 40+ lbs strollers, shelling-out big bucks in the process, and ditching them after a few months. the city mini stroller by baby jogger is more or less perfect in design. it's lightweight, sturdy enough to take on trails and on snowy roads, has generous room to grow, and collapses in a snap. i've had my stroller for 2.5 years and intend to use it for all of my children. i began using it in the recline position when my (long) baby was 3.5 months old.<br /><br />also, the handle bar height is great, even for tall people (i'm 5'10\\, and my husband is 6\\), despite not having an extender. rarely do i ever make contact with the bar below the stroller with my super long legs. it's an agile stroller, and is comfortably wide without hogging-up side walk and aisle space (i'm talking to you, uppavista stroller pushers).<br /><br />in my opinion, the add-on [[asin:b00155wj4e baby jogger adjustable belly bar]] is a must when using this stroller, as is the [[asin:b005pk1g76 diono buggy buddy stroller organizer, black]].<br /><br />as for the wacko 1-star reviewer who complained about safety straps negating a 1 hand fold, fyi, this is stipulated for legal indemnity reasons only. the usage of the red straps do not affect nor compromise the safety of this stroller in anyway. as a person with a background in contract law and tort law, i find the complaint and freak-out of this reviewer to be questionable and ridiculous.
after 9 years of trying,1 miscarriage, and 1 baby lost due to a problem babies have less than a 1% chance of having, we were very worried about sids.<br /><br />we looked at the angelcare sids monitor but heard from a mother of 7 in a babygaga group that they are not reliable and that this is the way to go. after looking through reviews we were a little bit skeptical from all the bad reviews about the batteries, how hard it is to position correctly, and how it always has false alarms but we went with it anyway.<br /><br />we started using it as soon as her umbilical stump came off, we have been using it for 3 months now (only overnight, the only time daughter isn't supervised) and only had 1 false alarm because we left the diaper too loose. we bought a replacement pack of 5 batteries because we were worried about the battery life after reading reviews but we are still on the original battery and it isn't even low yet. extremely easy to position on disposable diapers, just fold the top over in front and you can put it over baby's belly button (we put it to the side of her belly button), purple rubber sensor is very soft and flexible to move with baby and not poke them in the belly. vibration is strong and the beep is nice and loud when it does go off. it's nice being able to look down and see if the green light is blinking indicating baby is breathing for those times when baby is breathing shallow and you are not sure if they are breathing.
I purchased a Wendy B crib set for my son(now 15 mos. old) before she affiliated with BRU. Obviously I paid way more at the specialty store where I bought it. I have now chosen this set for my baby girl due in June. The most awesome thing about her sets is the 4 pc. slipcovered bumpers. I have looked everywhere and cannot find any other manufacturer who offers this. So the colors aren't EXACTLY what I was hoping for--so what! You need to think more about the functionality of your choices for baby's nursery more than the cosmetics, especially with more than one child. You may not appreciate it until your baby has their first bout with a stomach virus--some of you know what I mean! It is so convenient to be able to unzip the slipcovers off the bumper and throw them in the washer & dryer without ruining your entire crib bumper. It's also great if you need to wash only one section. Also, when your child gets too tall for a bumper, you can simply remove the section(s) where they could use it to climb out. My son is huge for 15 mos. and loves to use the 3 sections of the bumper still in his crib as pillows to lay on. The quality is excellent and this set will outlast the time your child is in the crib. If you don't like the feel of the sheet, go out and buy some extra sheets that coordinate with the set (that's what I did the first time). I feel there is no better choice than Wendy B. and we're lucky they're readily available at BRU vs. paying boutique pricing!
i wish i could give this pillow/company 10 stars!<br />honestly, i have never been so blown away by the quality of product and outstanding customer service as i am with this company. prior to ordering these pillows, i had some questions for the manufacturer, little sleepy head pillows, whom i emailed. much to my shock, chris, the owner, actually emailed me back with everything i needed. i then purchased two of these pillows for my twin 4 year old children. they arrived very promptly, and were clearly of good quality, but unfortunately, were too puffy for them, causing their necks to be at a weird uncomfortable angle. we were all so disappointed, so i emailed chris (as he had mentioned that they can custom make pillows), and he told me no problem, that he would make us two &#34;1/2 fill&#34; pillows. within about a week they were made and shipped to us at no charge! chris included a hand written note wishing us the best with the new pillows and to keep the old pillows with his compliments for when the children grow older or to use on trips. are you kidding me? who does that? this company, that's who. i will recommend them to everyone and anyone who will listen. by the way, the '1/2 fill' pillows are perfect in my opinion (for my children anyway), and my children absolutely love them. do not hesitate to buy anything from this company, as no matter what they will bend over backwards to help you.<br />thank you so much again chris!<br />kindest regards<br />nancy
this is a must have if you have a little one at home.  i have not  seen these sold at walmart, target, jewel, etc so consider investing in one before your baby gets sick.  you won't be able to run out to the local store to pick one up in desperate times.<br />this aspirator does not come with a filter - instead you can use tissue or toliet paper to block the mucus from entering the tube that leads to your mouth.  no worries that you'll end up with boogers in your mouth!<br />to use this, first sterilize all of the pieces with either a quick dunk in boiling water or the dishwasher.  put the pieces back together.  open the egg shaped part and put a loosely bunched tissue in.  close the egg shape container.  spray your little ones nose with a saline spray.  wait 30 seconds - 1 minute for the snot to soften.  have the mouth piece in your mouth and move the pointer (attached to the egg shape part) into the tip of the nose and suck gently.  repeat 2 to 3 times in necessary.<br />according to a conversation i had with my doctor, do not do this repeatedly throughout the day.  when they are sick, yes their noses are constantly be filled with mucus and it is possible to aggravate with the spray and aspirator.  try to do this before they eat, it will make eating a lot easier for them - they will be able to eat more and have less bubbles get into their system.  and before bed, so that it will be easier for the to fall asleep.<br />make sure that you clean after each use.
there are dozens of dramatic reviews on different versions of the diaper dekor refill and system. people are apparently very passionate about diaper pails.<br /><br />i have tried the biodegradable and non-biodegradable versions of the refills. i have not noticed any difference in smell/quality between them. i also use biodegradable diapers, so it makes sense to keep everything eco-friendly when i can and i like that diaper dekor gives you the option of choosing from green or regular liners.<br /><br />highlights:<br /><br />1) simple, straightforward re-fill design. the plastic is one long roll which you tie off as you use it. super easy and will save you money in the long-run.<br /><br />2) no stink. i have used the diaper dekor system and the regular and biodegradable refills for 2 years now and i have never had a problem with stink.  no diaper pail will smell fresh if its kept full for days on end and never cleaned out. i empty the pail every 4-5 days (you just tie it off, so you're not wasting liners), and i also run a sanitizing wipe along the inside and the top. that keeps it fresh and sanitary.<br /><br />3) price: because of the \\tie it off\\ system, you end up only using as much of the refill roll as you need. want to empty the pail after a particularly smelly diaper? fine-- tie off after a couple inches. leaving it full for many days? no problem-- tie off a few few feet. its a much less expensive system.<br /><br />biodegradable or regular? both work.
this stroller is hands down the best single stroller - jogger, umbrella, or other type - that i have used (i have used the uppababy, peg perego, and a few other brands). used for 2 kids so far, and it is in great condition. here's why i think it is best: 1) these wheels are awesome and so, so durable. they have yet to receive a flat or a puncture (i hope never!), and we only fill up air maybe twice a year. the ride is so smooth, and i am able to push this stroller with one hand. 2) the double tray - genius (why don't all other strollers have this option??) my kids both loved the tray - they were able to put their cups/bottles, food, toys, etc. while i was able to keep more than enough in the &#34;parent&#34; tray - a water bottle, my keys, phone, money, etc. 3) super easy to fold 4) the price - $103? so affordable, and you get more than your money's worth - i would think this is at least a $250 stroller. most strollers under $150 are usually so cheaply made and have horrible wheels that make you suffer to no end and pray that your child will start walking so that you do not need to use a stroller anymore.... the baby trend is clearly in a different league, and i really appreciate that the manufacturer takes our budget into consideration. there is no reason that a parent on a budget needs to suffer with a low quality stroller just because they can't afford or don't want to spend $400+ on a stroller. 5) the canopy - so flexible and able to fully cover my child from the sun.
the dena indigo decorative pillow is the perfect accent to the coordinating bedding set.  i have the bedding set as well which is mixed with different prints and patterns.  the decorative pillow is mainly pale blue with white in the shape of a little elephant.  one side of the pillow has a patterned stripe throughout.  the other side of the pillow has different patterns throughout.  the decorative pillow resembles the body of an elephant with a trunk, ears, as well as a tail.  it measures as indicated 14.5 x 10.5 x 6 inches and is quite lightweight.  i have one pillow but i think two pillows would make a prettier looking accent to the bedding since each side has a different pattern.  the ears on the elephant stick out like little flaps on both sides of the pillow and the tail dangles from the back of the elephant.  there is an eye on each side of the pillow as well as a little mouth right at the base of the trunk.  the quality of the pillow is wonderful, its actually quite comfortable to lay on, even though it is a decorative pillow.  there are no loose strings, the stitching is done very well.  the pillow makes the perfect accent to our nursery.  we have a baby elephant theme as the nursery decor and it looks perfect with the rest of the bedroom.  i love this adorable little decorative pillow sitting in the corner of my sons crib.  its the perfect accent pillow to the dena indigo crib bedding set.  promotional discount provided in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.
what i like most about these thermos containers is that the liquid will stay cold for a long time. i haven鈥檛 tested exactly how long. but i live in southern california and it can get very hot here. i will put water with ice in these and leave the house with the kids around 9 am and the water is still cold when we eat lunch around 1 pm. while i do not use this for milk or juice, i can see that these would work well to carry milk out of the house for later.<br /><br />they are easy to clean and i like they are not made of plastic. i believe the straw parts are silicone 鈥?this is great if your kids tend to chew on the straw like mine do. these are very durable. it is a little hard to take apart sometimes for cleaning, but once you get the hang of it it鈥檚 fine. this is dishwasher safe, although the cap would likely melt if it falls into the heating unit of your dishwasher.<br /><br />the top has three parts: the plastic lid, the straw that goes in your mouth and the long tube to reach for the liquid. my husband tends to forget to add the straw 鈥?and without it you cannot drink! this cup is very durable. it will leak if your child shakes it, holds it upside down and sometimes it may splash a drop when popped open. but because i use this for water it isn't a problem as it has not proved to be at all messy. but i would not recommend for younger toddlers that shake their cups. these [[asin:b00ohkrm5a playtex playtime straw sippy cup, super friends, 9 ounce]] worked really well when my kids were younger.
Gumdrop, how do I love thee?  Let me count the ways:  1.  One piece construction means they are easy to clean.  We had problems with dirt collecting in the seal or soapy water getting stuck in the nipple of other pacifiers.  With Gumdrop, dirt or germs have no where to collect and hide.    2.  Medical-grade silicon means we can boil the pacifiers to sterilize them or run them through the dishwasher.    3.  Soft nipple that my baby loves.    4.  Firm frame that my baby loves to teeth on constantly, but it's not too hard for her little teeth and gums.    5.  Durability!!!  I wish every product was as durable as these pacifiers!  We've been using them 24/7 for 10 months and they are still in perfect condition.  I check them regularly for wear since she chews so hard on them and we treat them pretty rough, but so far they're perfect!    6.  BPA safe.  Yes, they are.  The center frame is not BPA free, however, it is completely covered by the medical-grade silicone so the baby is never in contact with the center frame.  You shouldn't use it IF the silicone layer becomes compromised, obviously.  (Perhaps if you ran them over with a car, the silicone layer would be compromised.  Otherwise, it holds up amazingly well.)    7.  The cut-out for the nose seems like a little thing, but it's a big thing to my baby.  This is the only one-piece pacifier with the nose cut-out that I could find.    8.  Little hole for a binky strap to loop through, which is critical for us.    Bottom line:  Love love love these pacifiers!
i love this stroller. it can be used from day 1 as the seat turns into a flat bassinet. when your baby grows you use the same seat for them to sit. i've also used it with the car seat from mia moda which fits into the same frame, replacing the regular seat. you can have the baby facing you or facing forward, which is a wonderful feature. the adjustable handle makes it very easy for my 6'6 husband to push the stroller. the basket is roomy, i carry my groceries in it. last but not least, i get compliments on the looks of this stroller, everyone thinks it's one of the \\expensive european strollers\\.     the one drawback was figuring out the folding mechanism the first time i used it. i almost returned the stroller because i tried opening it about 10 times and it just didn't work. then magically i figured out that you have to pull on the tab they recommend and push down the stroller bar with my hips, and it folds very easily. do not give up - the stroller is totally worth it, especially when the new mia moda infant car seats are gonna be available on the market again in may 2010 (the old ones were recalled).    updated 16 months later: while i still love this stroller, my son who is 99th percentile for height and weight, is quickly outgrowing this stroller. he's 32 inches tall and 27 lbs. his head is getting close to the canopy....i may only have a few months left. so if you're tall parents, you're likely to have a tall baby, and in the long run, the kid will likely outgrow this stroller before they turn 2.
i scoured the reviews of all the other top reusable pouches out there of this size, and decided to try these. i'm glad i did, and don't have any complaints so far after using them regularly for many weeks.<br /><br />pros:<br /><br />you can't beat clear.<br />they are relatively easy to close.<br />no leaks so far.<br />they are super easy to fill.<br />they can use tops that come on the store-bought pouches (stock up while you're still using them!)<br />super easy to clean and fit a standard bottle brush easily.<br />they do not hold food stains, even tomatoes. (i forgot a blended spaghetti and meat sauce pouch in the fridge for a week and thought i'd have an orange-stained bag for sure. nope! no food residue or color was left behind with a normal washing. really, really impressive).<br />my 17 month old can hold it, no problem.<br />it is difficult to make a mess with these. you'd have to step on it, or make the contents pretty watery in order for stuff to leak out if it drops.<br />it's strong, thick plastic.<br />it's big enough to feed an adult as well as a hungry kid.<br /><br />cons:<br /><br />the only con is that it can be difficult for my toddler to empty the bag without help, since it's relatively rigid plastic. i usually just squeeze the bottom, fold it in half, and wrap a hair tie around it to hold it so the stuff doesn't fall to the bottom of the bag where he can't suck it out. i don't see this as a design flaw, though. it seems expected for a larger sized bag of higher-quality and thicker plastic.
I'm not one of those moms that needs every new thing under the sun, but this is truly worth it's weight in gold!  I had gotten this when my daughter was 3 months old and it is so nice that when she starts fussing, the pacifier doesn't fall out of her mouth completely.  She's holding on to mr toutou, so once she's done fussing, she just sucks on the pacifier without me needing to put it back in her mouth.  This is also great for car rides.  When she wakes up in the car, he's right there for her.  No need to scream or have mommy reach back to find a pacifier and put it in! She's almost 5 months now and after seeing how well it worked, I bought a backup- Elliot the elephant, a replacement pacifier and the soft teethers that attach (not a necessity yet, but she still enjoys the textures).  Everything is high quality.  I would recommend this over the other brands that don't detach from the stuffed animal because the pacifier part needs to be washed off a lot in our pet friendly home and I think its gross to put a pacifier in the washer/dryer.  It would get nicks and cracks in it much easier and common sense says that's where bacteria likes to live.  The pacifier itself is very similar to our advent soothie pacifier and I never worry about it being pulled off the stuffed animal by her- it's secured by three round nubbins that push in to a soft plastic on the dogs head.  Even if it did fall off, it's the same exact size as her soothie.  I really recommend this product and will be ordering one for each and every baby shower I attend!
If you're reading this review, you probably already know that Wubbanubs are awesome pacifiers. We use them in the NICU where I've worked, and they are perfect even from the very start.  This review is more about why the owl is the best of the Wubbanubs! We have this one and the giraffe, and I've encountered many others at work and that friends' kids have. This one always seems more sturdy and less floppy than the others. The soothie pacifier is not super light, and the giraffe's head and neck flops all over the place when I'm holding it. My baby is 5 months and she has a hard time getting that one back in her mouth when it falls out. The owl has a thicker neck and is sturdier overall. If the pacifier falls out, my baby can generally put it back in her mouth without having a huge meltdown (this is especially important when driving down the highway and trying not to crash). She also likes to grab his wings and feet. Some of the newer Wubbanubs come in bright/neon colors, but I like that this one looks like a normal animal. And, of course, owls are super in these days! ;) There are a lot of cute Wubbanubs out there, but in my opinion, this one is the best!  The only negative I would say (and this applies to all Wubbanubs and similarly styled pacifiers) is that you really shouldn't let your baby sleep with them! We use ours primarily in the car, but sometime around the house too. We just use a regular Avent pacifier for overnight, though, as stuffed animals are not safe to let them sleep with overnight (especially when very young).
I didn't want to give my baby a pacifier AT ALL. I was paranoid that since I was breastfeeding, that any pacifier was going to ruin things... but we were at the hospital for a test and the baby was fussing a bit and the nurse asked if we had a pacifier and I said no. She reached into the cupboard and pulled out one of these, saying they were highly recommended. We took it from her, thanked her, and threw it in the diaper bag. (We didn't try it right then because, as I mentioned, I did NOT want my baby to use a pacifier.)<br /><br />And then came a time when he was really fussy. And we had just watched The Happiest Baby on the Block DVD and learned that Sucking is something that, ironically, PACIFIES a baby and calms them down... so I gave the baby the Soothie...and he loved it! LOVED IT! I immediately went out and bought two more 2-packs (from Target and Babies R Us). I also bought the next-stage pacifiers (one step up from newborn).<br /><br />Of course if he is super agitated (or hungry) then it won't stay in his mouth, but if he is somewhat calm already, then it's enough to keep him calm. I never thought the pacifier was too heavy, as another reviewer thought, claiming that was why it wouldn't stay in the baby's mouth. I also never thought the pacifier holder was too big. I didn't have any pacifier attachers yet, so I just bought the ones made for this pacifier and it worked just fine.<br /><br />As far as the breastfeeding worries, I continued breastfeeding for a few weeks after the introduction of the Soothie with no ill effect.
i recently bought these all excited to make my own organic baby food with vegetables (i was annoyed at the price and content at the store - i mean, common, babies will not only eat mostly fruit). my lo just turned one and has loved being able to feed herself with the baby food packs - so independent already!<br /><br />because of the overall good reviews and the good price, i choose to buy the precious tummies to start making my own. overall this is a great product. the zip-lock top is amazingly secure (almost too secure, very difficult to open - but that means absolutely no spills or messes). they fit up to 6 oz of food, which is more than i need at this time, but will be great as she grows older for snacks. filling them is a bit tricky, but i can imagine all similar products have this problem. several other reviews have recommended getting a food funnel, which i have not yet done but sounds like a good idea. i have managed mostly well with using a baby spoon to fill the pouches though. lastly, i really like that they are machine washable and come out pretty clean - twice i have had to just rinse one out afterwards because a little was stuck in a crease.<br /><br />initially i did have a problem with a few of the pouches, with the ziplock portion detaching from the top portion. i contacted the company and immediately they shipped out replacements. i found their customer service to be amazing, and although there was an initial hitch in some of my product, overall they work great, easy to use, easy to clean, and most important my daughter likes them!
i have a small home so i did not have an option of getting a big swing.  i registered for this and have been using it successfully with my little one for two months (i have not even had to change the batteries yet).  now that i have it, i cannot imagine having anything else (i.e., a large stationary swing and separate bouncer), regardless of my house size.  one of the things that i love about this is that it is portable - i can even move it around when my daughter is in it.  i have moved it from the kitchen table, to the back deck, to my bedroom, to the living room....wherever i go in the house i can move it so that i can see her.  the other great thing is that if she gets fussy when it's swinging, i can switch it immediately to vibrating.  i can't imagine having to take a fussy baby out of it and move her to a different seat just to see if she wants the vibrations.<br /><br />some people have complained that the swing is too fast.  if you just swing it without a baby in it, it seems fast, but once you put some weight in it it swings at a very nice setting.  other complaints were that it is too hard.  i purchased a \\snuzzler\\ [[asin:b000dzs720 kiddopotamus snuzzler complete head and body support, ivory terry]] which i move from the swing to the stroller, to the carseat.  this too has been a lifesaver, since newborns are so small and cannot support themselves.  however, now that my daughter is bigger she seems perfectly happy in the swing without it.<br /><br />this is a product that i could not live without as a parent.  i recommend this to everyone!!
i have a slight obsession with trying different bottles and i have to say these have landed at the top of my list! my son is 3 months old, not colicky and formula fed. i wasn't really trying to fix anything like gas or spit up because i feel like he is not excessive with either of those...but i just like to see what bottle he seems the most comfortable with. i started with medela when i was breastfeeding and the nipples collapsed all the time, i tried avent original and it just was annoying and nipple is long imo, i tried avent natural which i liked but the air vent in the nipple got punctured when trying to clean milk out of it and then the bottle leaked!! ugh!, i tried dr. brown...and i was happy with those but cleaning all the parts was annoying and since my baby didn't really need all that venting i guess they were pointless to me. nuk bottles are horrible you can't even shake your formula to mix it because of how the nipple is tilted. playtex new style drop in bottle omg i'm not even gonna go there!!! yuck! tommee tippe  i jus wasn't really a fan of them the nipple seemed to come loose from ring way to easily and i really didn't like the shape... i love the lansinoh momma bottle and nipple and so does my baby!!! it is comfortable to hold and he seems very comfy and doesn't have to re-adjust his latch or release for air (with parent's choice bottles was drawing away from nipple to vent air...not good!). sooooo easy to clean as well with the wide neck and this also makes easy to put formula into bottle. i just bought a comotomo bottle and i'll see how that goes!
for something as simple as a night light i was surprised at how particular i could be. i just wanted something to illuminate the bathroom for those late night excursions and a long hallway. these lights covered both very well.<br /><br />pros:<br />2-pack<br />led remains cool and saves electricity year round.<br />visually appealing.<br />nice symmetrical light pattern.<br />dusk sensor present (falls into both pro and con).<br /><br />con:<br />dusk sensor not sensitive enough.<br />not bright enough unless you're already acclimated for night vision.<br /><br />the light is emitted through what appears to be an acrylic lens like a fiber optic. it shines 3 symmetrical bands outward against the wall. one straight up, and the other 2 are angled out from the 10:00 and 2:00 positions. the 2 side bands are about 2&#34; wide and the center one fans out to about 12&#34; wide before it disappears. the band spacing is identical on both of mine so they would look nice if viewed together in a room or hallway. it gives it a precision look.<br /><br />against lighter colored walls there is enough light once your eyes have adapted to darkness. if you need a night light for a space where you're always entering from a lighted area these may not seem strong enough for you. but when i wake up in the middle of the night i can see enough to navigate both areas.<br /><br />so for me, the only real con is the lights remain on during most days, so it's good they're led. if you use them in a place that gets nice sunlight, they will turn off. i'm quite happy with them as long as they last.
this high chair is superb. it acts as a high-chair, a swing, and a recliner. my toddler daughter still enjoys this chair tremendously, despite not having liked the swing mode when she was a baby. from a parental point of view, there are many positive features, and a couple of negatives. we have been using it for 19 months without any major issues, and i think we will be able to use it for at the very least another year. i bet that we will be able to sell it for a substantial amount when we are done with it, because it has held up really well. we're clearly big fans of this product, and we went on to purchase the car seat, which has also turned out to be a fantastic product.<br /><br />positives:<br />the chair and cover are easily cleaned<br />it is solid and well designed so that it won't break or fall over<br />it folds up to occupy very little floor space (this was really important when we were in a small apartment)<br />it looks and feels great (it feels like soft padded leather, not plastic or imitation velvet like so many others)<br />the table surface is easy to clean<br />the design of this unit is spectacular, and it's really well thought out<br /><br />negatives:<br />the removable tray has plastic alignment pins that don't line up well with the handle brackets<br />the rotating plastic pieces that the plastic alignment pins fit into are cheap and often partly pull out<br />the locking mechanism on the wheels is sometimes difficult to release when moving the unit<br />the levers on the sides for unlocking the base (so that it can fold) are difficult to activate
this stroller is awesome for taller people. i am 5'9 and its nice to not have to hunch over to reach the handle to push it. the handles are at  nice height and it feel like it navigates really well. it doesn't get stuck on uneven concrete, it handles with ease. i don't have to worry about the front wheels getting stuck when im trying to push it after stopping. i chose this stroller for my 3.5 year old daughter whom complains of frequent leg pains (doctor says it's growing pains) she is about 40 inches and 33lbs and she fits nicely in this stroller. her feet don't dangle to the ground so, don't i have to make sure i'm not dragging them because she forgot to pick them up. she's doesn't look crumpled up in the stroller, she's able to sit up straight and comfortably. it also has a 5 pt harness. i initially disagreed with this idea when i bought it. i took my daughter shopping and remember how my daughter lies to reach out and mess with clothes or whatever she can reach now and again. guess who was happy for the 5 point harness after that :d the one down side but i'm okay with dealing with is, it's a bit heavier than the other smaller strollers.  i really think its a little heavier because this stroller is very supportive of heavier weight. i also like that there is a basket at the bottom, an umbrella, and an organizer by the handles. oh, the grip on the stroller is really nice as well. over all i don't regret purchasing this product and it was worth the extra $20, i was gonna just get a cheap $19.99 one. i think my child can use this one for at least another year or year and a half.
We've had this little giraffe for three months, and he's endured about two months drooly use now. WubbaNub (or Wubs, as he's called at our house) is a great friend and comfort for our baby. Why? Major pros:<br /><br />* Easy to grip: The feet are just big enough and round enough that she can get a solid grasp on any of them, and sometimes two at a time.<br />* Easy to hold: The little, soft body, which is filled with something slightly softer than beans, is easy for the baby to wrap an arm around, and light enough that she can lift and spin the giraffe with one determined fist.<br />* Easy for chewing: Not only are the feet satisfying for snacking, the little horns at the face make for interesting small chewy pieces against hier gums.<br />* High quality silicone pacifier: The Soothie pacifier that's attached is great, not just for the usual Soothie benefits but also because it's very sturdily attached to the giraffe's body. It can safely travel the washer and then be rinsed in hot water itself for maximum cleanliness.<br /><br />Points for debate:<br />* Doesn't always stay in her mouth longer. Yep, true -- sometimes she tugs it out. But she also seems less likely to have the whole thing drop from her grasp and fall to the floor; Wubs hits the deck much less often than the other, solo Soothies we have around the house.<br />* Longevity: We've had this in heavy rotation (daily play time probably equal to two hours) for a month, and he's showing a bit of wear. I imagine we'll need to restock with a second or third-string Wubbanub within the next three months if his popularity remains strong.
so my 10mo old can use a straw cup but doesn't know how to tilt up a regular cup yet.  i think i've bought every one they make, so here's my review:<br /><br />nuby flip-n-sip: strong valve so no leaks, hard to suck.  she got frustrated very easily with this originally and i even find it hard to suck.  she doesn't seem to get these handles.<br /><br />munchkin click lock flip top: medium valve, no leaks, no handles which we seem to need. fairly easy suck. one of our go-to's for water.<br /><br />munchkin click lock straw: light valve, no leaks, no handles. easy suck. likes to chew on the straw. one of our go-to's for water.<br /><br />munchkin click lock weighted straw: light valve, no leaks (unless you don't screw lid on correctly), loves handles, likes to chew on the straw, weight works well. if you squeeze the straw while running water through the weight you can clean it pretty well.  comes with a straw cleaner.  i like that it's clear.  first cup she'll drink milk out of.  i think this is our favorite. sometimes i kind of prime it for her with the first drink. wish it had oz markings.<br /><br />zo-li bot straw: no valve but closed straw so easy suck, leaks only if tossed just right on the floor, dribbles a bit if on side otherwise (similar to nipple), easy to hold handles, comes with a straw cleaner.  she's not keen on milk in it but drinks water well. i like that it's clear and has oz markings.<br /><br />lollacup: no valve, open straw, easiest suck.  this is just a cup with a straw.  the straw may have a weight on it but it's short and stiff and doesn't move.  she likes it.  i haven't tried milk in it.
this walker is exactly what we were looking for. bright colors, plenty of things to keep baby busy. the little play station is removable,(not by baby), to reveal a tray for snacks, etc. it has adjustable heigth so it will grow with your baby. our 5 month old granddaughter's feet could touch the ground on the lowest setting. she was able to move it within minutes. backwards, but hey, she moved it. it moves easy but i can see, with the brake pads, it will have a problem on plush carpet. we don't have this problem due to low pile carpet and hard wood floors. i think those pads are there as extra insurance against tip-over. although the unit seems pretty sure footed to me. i'm sure, with a little enginunity, the plush carpet issue can be handled. it folds down to a reasonably small size for travel. i need to mention a couple of things that will help. first, read the instructions. they're easy to read and will help you. check twice before installing the cloth seat. i put it on inside out the first time. and the little rings that hold the seat in place are difficult to get seated in. you will have to tug pretty hard but they will go in place. the little brake pads, you will know what i'm talking about when you get to them. they fit very tight but must be completely seated of they will not let the walker move. i ended up using a rubber mallet to lightly tap them in. don't get carried away. all you need is a light tap or two. this is a great little walker, your baby will love it. one more thing, don't worry if your baby's feet wont touch the ground while sitting. he or she will soon learn to scoot forward and stand. enjoy!
my daughter was a year old before i made the leap into the world of wool covers. i wish i'd tried them sooner! i washed and lanolized this cover and put it on my daughter over a large brown edge workhorse fitted from green mountain diapers. a couple hours later, i patted her bum, totally dry. another hour and the cover was still totally dry, so curious, i put her on the changing table and pulled it off. the fitted diaper was soaked, just like i expected since she's a heavy wetter--but the kissas cover barely felt damp on the inside and was completely dry on the outside. that converted me to wool right then! i bought another one immediately. i just wish they came in more colors. there's tutorials on how to dye them all over the web, but i wish they came in colors anyway for lazy people like me.<br /><br />a sizing note. my daughter is about 22 lbs and 30 inches tall, so right in an overlapping weight range for the medium and large covers. both the medium and large fit right now. the medium is very trim and fits under clothes, but is starting to get a tad tight around the tummy--not to the point where it seems to be bothering her though. the large is roomier, but not baggy, and fits well over bulkier diapers. she's got plenty of room to grow into it without it looking like a tent on her. so if anyone has a child whose weight falls into the range for two different sizes, i'd say think about what you will use the cover for. if you want it to go under daytime clothes the smaller size may be the way to go. if you want plenty of room to grow, or for bulky nighttime diapers, go with the larger size. either way, it's a great cover.
our baby went on a nursing strike for a couple days. this *might* have been what got her back on the breast; it's hard to say since we tried a lot of things at the same time.<br /><br />the first couple feeds with this our baby definitely did not like it - but then she had already stopped feeding from the breast too. we would offer it to her, she would refuse. offer again, refuse. then after a couple tries, she did feed from it. a couple times the first day we had to start with our regular nipple (dr browns) and transfer to this when she was a bit more calm; then she would take it. if she was really really hunger this was not the way to get started.<br /><br />as others reported, she did seem to occasionally choke, maybe on a heavy flow, maybe air, the first couple times. the flow didn't seem slower than other nipples - maybe even faster when she was really hunger, but she just had to work for it. we just had to take the nipple away for a sec and then she'd continue when offered it again.<br /><br />this also made it easier for her to stop feeding when full - she had a habit of feeding until she spit up before, and not tolerating a bottle being taken away, but with this nipple she will stop when full.<br /><br />by the second day she was taking this regularly and by the third day she was back to breastfeeding. not entirely sure this is what did it since we also tried a few others things, but it seemed to help.<br /><br />there are a lot of bad reviews, so i guess it doesn't work for everyone. maybe people didn't stick with it (which i understand if it causes your baby to choke), but it was great for us with a little perseverance.
got this monitor 18 months ago, still working strong. a few minor things i disliked at first, but have gotten used to, and are not a big deal at all:<br /><br />1. when panning the volume is shut completely off. so, if your baby is crying and you need to move the camera to 'find' him, his cries will cut out, just for a few seconds.<br />2. the lowest volume setting (other than mute) is too loud (for me!) i am a light sleeper, i found volume level 1 to be too loud, however, laying it face-down on an insulated surface seemed to help me sleep just fine.<br />3. zoom has just one option, and its kinda grainy. not a big deal but not a clear image when zoom is used and only 1 level to 'zoom' into.<br /><br />this is what i wanted from a monitor, a basic, nice, pan and scan monitor that works! no other bells and whistles.  the range on the pan is amazing, with the ability to view the ceiling all the way to the floor and both walls (although not a huge room) it is very impressive. pan and zoom are available as a touch/scroll button in the front of the monitor so you don't have to access the menu, volume is not, however we just leave it on low all the time so thats not a big issue for us.<br /><br />sidenote we did have to purchase new rechargeable batteries about 3 months ago, since then the battery life has been great. and by great i mean, need to charge all night, fine for entire day (probably 5-6 hours)<br /><br />all in all for what is out there in the world of monitors, this is a great buy.  i consider the pan/tilt option a necessity and wish other monitors would offer it at a decent price without all the other fancy stuff that i don't need.
i had this bassinet with my first son and we hated it at first because it would only work for 10 seconds or so and my son would not lay in it what so ever. we were so aggravated with it and so tired lol. after two days of having it i thought maybe it was put together with bad batteries (my fil put it together) so i flipped it over and noticed it was still on &#34;demo&#34;. i switched it to normal mode and it worked like a dream, i laid our newborn down in it as a &#34;last try and i'm trashing this thing&#34;, turned the rocker on and he was loving it!! my husband and i were so thankful to find that switch and have our newborn sleeping peacefully! i got rid of it after our first because the part they lay in became slanted and i didn't feel safe putting another baby in it. i don't think they're really built to last that long anyway. i just reordered this for our son who is due in these next few weeks and i am so excited about receiving this. i hope he loves it as much as his brother.<br /><br />a little about the product itself:<br />it rocks side to side and has a turn knob to control fast or slow rocking.<br />the music is soothing from what i remember. we really only used one sound and it was the &#34;nature&#34; sound.<br />has storage on bottom, i personally always forgot about this but could be helpful if you are moving it room to room to help carry whatever you need to take with you.<br />design was nice in my opinion. i feel as though it could be used for either gender.<br />only con was they aren't built to last more than one child (my personal experience and opinion) but they're priced reasonably so i don't have a problem rebuying.
this thing saved me with my second and third children. with my first child my milk took 3 days to come in,  in the hospital my daughter was screaming after 8 hours of being born. the not so knowledgeable lactation consultant told me to &#34;just keep nursing her &#34; . well i did and ended up having my daughter nurse until i was bloody, literally missing skin in a certain area. suddenly after the first night one horrendous nurse was giving me additude because my daughter was crying non stop. so much so she recommended to my doctor that a drug test be done!!! this was not only embarrassing, it took even longer of a stay (try getting a newborn who hasn't eaten in 24 hours to lee) . well drug text came back negative for all things (as i knew it would. the lactation consultant and nurses insisted that newborn are born with enough in them to keep them healthy until mothers milk comes in. that's all dandy, great she wont die, but that doesn't mean a newborn baby knows how to deal with hunger pangs, hence the screaming.so that was the end of my breastfeeding my first child. so with my second and third children i went into the hospital with this, i used it on and off until my milk came in, its a win win for me and my kids.  i get the stimulation needed to make your body start producing and my kids don't deal with severe hunger pangs for their first days on earth. if any lc or nurse is reading this that has ever done anything like this to someone, you should find a different job because you're most likely as awful as the two numbskulls i dealt with.  youtube has videos on how to properly use one of these, i beleive by dr.jack newman (breastfeeding genius) .
i am now the proud mama of twin boys, jace and tamico!!! my sister did some research once she found out i was having twins and found your product online. we live in edmonton, alberta, canada and do not have any products here like this. my sons were born 11 days ago, at 34 weeks, weighing in at 4lb 4 oz, and 4 lb 10 oz, respectfully. they are still currently in the nicu at the hospital doing really well and i have taken my twinz pillow to the nursery so i can tandem breastfeed my boys. your product has allowed me to sit comfortably for the 2-3 hrs i am sitting in the nursing chair feeding and cuddling my sons, which prior to using it, had given me a sore back and \\numb bum\\ as i call it.<br /><br />every time i go in to see my boys, the nursing staff and doctors ask me about my pillow and how it works. they are super intrigued and impressed once i give them a quick demonstration. recently in our area, there has been an explosion in twin births and this hospital delivers most of them in our city. i tell everyone the name of your product and will be forwarding your name and website to the staff there, for future referrals for you. new and experienced moms can use this amazing pillow to make their babies and themselves super comfortable.<br /><br />i also love the super soft fabric. the price was fantastic as well, since i paid around $70 for my single nursing pillow i purchased for my daughter a few years back.<br /><br />i will be certain to keep endorsing your product, as it will make feedings that much more enjoyable and comfortable... which makes for a happy mama! thank you for such an amazing product!<br /><br />sincerely,<br /><br />doreen russell
This giraffe paci is amazing!<br />I hated these pacis when my daughter got one from the hospital when she was born. I tried 2 others and she wouldn't have them at all. I tried to go without one at all but that wasn't an option with her. She has a very strong urge to suck to soothe. Since she's breastfed too, that meant that I was nursing her for 2/3+ of the day. As soon as I went back to the soothie pacifer she loved it but could not hold on to it for anything so we pretty much had to hold it for her the whole time. Then, I decided to try a wubbanub. Best decision ever!<br />I actually got this giraffe one from a yardsale right after I had ordered my daughter the pink 'mary meyer jasmine giraffe'. I thought I'd like it better because it was all pink and cute but wanted to have a 2nd as a backup/ rotation. But, once I got the pink one in I really did not like it. It's not as floppy or long as this giraffe, which makes all the difference. And it looks nothing like a giraffe- short neck- more like a horse or cow? lol.<br />This one is perfect for laying on my daughters chest or beside her and it holds the pacifier for her perfectly.<br />She's 2,5 mos old and just getting to the point of trying to grab it and put it back in her mouth herself. She's getting pretty good at it, considering she really don't have much hand eye coordination. She can shove the giraffe's head around with her hands and root around until she gets it back in her mouth. The other one just falls away if she quits sucking.<br />I wanted 2 to have to rotate through and to have a backup. But, now since I really don't like the other one, I'm seriously considering just ordering another one of this.
This is a miracle product.  WubbaNub should win a prize, for most awesome baby product for PARENTS!  Why parents? Because you finally do not have to get up every 2 min to put the soothie back in after your baby spits it up!<br /><br />My baby played a game called stupid soothie and mommy, where she would suck the soothie until mommy got back in bed, waited 2 min for mommy to get comfy, and BAM, spit it out, or with the help of her tiny long fingers, hurl the soothie right out of the crib.  I swear I would get up at least 20 times with each time I put her in the crib.  I was growing so frustrated.  Then while reading some forum, I kept seeing references to Wubbanub, due to the odd name, I looked it up, and it was like a bright light had shined on me!  I was saved!  I ordered one immediately, and life has been a bliss ever since!  My baby would also go into crying spells in the car, when I drove and the soothie fell out, and I had no way of getting it back into babies mouth asap.  The Wubbanub has stopped all of this drama.  The bear design in particular works better than some others, the month of the bear is bigger and holds the soothie down and in the mouth.  We also have the giraffe, and while cute, the mouth of giraffe where soothie is connected is thin and longer, and the soothie doesn't stay in quite as well as with the bear.<br /><br />Additional tip: if you put a blanket on top of the bear, it stays in even better, less risk of slipping out.  Also, after the initial wash/soothie boil, instead of boiling everyday and getting half the bear wet, I bought pacifier wipes that work well to get all the grime/germs off.<br /><br />This has seriously been a life saver!
At first, I have no idea what kind of diaper bag to choose. Flexible? Rigid? Small? Or Big? I went through pages and reviews and got more confused. Some of them look fashion but I really worried about whether they are practical for me. After all, it is just a diaper bag.<br />I asked my friends whose baby girl is already 3 years old. She told me that you got to buy a diaper bag that is big enough especially when you have twin. That is the most important. Soon you will find it extremely helpful because there is never too many baby stuff to carry. She really have the point.<br />This bag is big and light enough for me. There are some points that I like about it.<br />-It doesn鈥檛 have too complex compartments inside which I like. It is easy for me to put things in and take out.<br />-The fabric inside is plastic which is easy to clean in case of bottle leakage. The material is good quality. It doesn鈥檛 have that kind of smell which is really not healthy for holding baby stuff.<br />-It has two side pocket and a large pocket for diaper. That is thoughtful because they are the thing you need handy such as diaper or bottle of milk. You need it immediately most of the time.<br />-It surprises me that it also has a transparent plastic bag. I use it to hold dirty or wet clothes. Very thoughtful.<br /><br />List of things I bring for a day out in case you need to know:<br />-A double stroller for my two children which our diaper bag can be easily attached.<br />-change of clothes<br />-diaper for two child.<br />-medicine like vitamins.<br />-paper handkerchief<br />-talc<br />-First aid kit<br />-pacifiers<br />-milk and two bottles.<br />-my wallet<br />-book. I love to read in the park.
with my first baby 8 years ago, i found the only use for a monitor was during the day, when i'm on the go -- so that i could listen for the end of a nap (since at night all the crackling, and meaningless baby stirings only served to give me a terrible nights sleep.  when she was really awake or needed attention, i woke plenty fast).  and although most baby gear had been long since been purged out of my basement, i still had my basic sound monitor from all of those years ago.  and at first the baby was in a bassinet next to me, and then -- knowing how terrible the sound from my old monitor was -- i didn't even hook it up!  but i really did want a day time monitor. so something possessed me to spring for this one and -- wow! i am impressed.  the sound quality is excellent and no crackling -- and it goes into a sound passive mode when all is quiet up there.  and the temperature monitor is a nice extra although not high utility for me (we have central air and great heat so not something i worry about too much).  and heck, it looks cute too.   so the point is, if you're not as easy going as me or your baby's room/crib is far enough away that you want a monitor on overnight too - this is a great choice! you might actually get some sleep.  the only thing i wished for was to find an offering with audio only (like this one, with no movement monitor) that has two remote listening handsets.  my husband and i often do tag team on the baby care while each is off doing things with our \\big kids\\ or chores around the house and yard, so it really would be best if they had a 2 handset offering like they do with the movement monitor offering.  they migtht make it, but i couldn't find it anywhere.
i have tried 6 different types of bottles for my breast fed baby. she suffers from gas so i wanted to try the anti gas/colic bottles and a bottle that was as close to breast feeding as possible. (this was not an easy task. so here is the break down of the 6 different bottles from my favorite to my least favorite.<br /><br />tommee tippee sensitive tummies<br />pros:<br />-natural shaped nipple<br />-good tubed venting system<br />-jaw mechanics close to breast feeding<br />cons:<br />-lots of parts to clean<br />-no disc between bottle and nipple<br /><br />munchkin latch<br />pros:<br />-good bottom venting system<br />-natural shaped nipple<br />-jaw mechanics close to breast feeding<br />-milk comes out of the nipple usually only when baby is sucking<br />cons:<br />-baby had difficult time latching<br /><br />dr. brown<br />pros:<br />-good tubed venting system<br />cons:<br />-not natural shaped nipple,<br />-doesn't have same mechanics as breast feeding,<br />-lots of parts to clean.<br /><br />born free:<br />pros:<br />-good venting system<br />cons:<br />-air kept squeaking in the corners of my babies mouth during feeding<br />-average shaped nipple<br />-faster flow than other slow flow<br /><br />phillips avent<br />pros:<br />-natural shaped nipple with cutouts to make the nipple more pliable<br />cons:<br />-not very good venting system. i had to keep burping during the feeding.<br /><br />lanisoh momma<br />pro:<br />-natural shaped nipple<br />con:<br />-terrible venting system (worst of the bunch). baby was up till 3am with gas pain.<br /><br />i really wanted my baby to like the munchkin bottle the best.  it seemed to have the closest to breastfeeding mechanics of the bunch.
This is such an adorable pacifier and has great features too.  One of the best parts about this pacifier is that I do not have to attach it to a string pacifier holder (which could get wrapped around my little one), I would simply just rest it on him and he would push at it if he wanted it.  This sweet little animal is light weight yet heavy enough to stay put in a carseat or while he sleeps in his bassinet.  This product is great, I have had it for my child since he was born, I gave it to him about 4-5 days in as a newborn (which I have come to realize is the best time to give a pacifier to a newborn, it is not too early for nipple confusion and not too late that they refuse it).  He has been able to grasp at it from day one.  He was able to push the little animal back in if it started to fall out or push it out if he did not want it.  The design makes it easier to stay in their mouths when they are so little and are learning to suck.     It is also easy to wash and it drys quickly.  I recommend two so that you can always have one ready to go.    I did see a few other wubbanub pacifiers on sale at Babies'R'us, but when my friend purchased hers I noticed that the quality was not as good, they were much more flimsy and very light weight, making it hard to stay put.   When I was still pregnant I wrote...I love this product, it is so precious and this is the best price I have seen for these.  My friends baby has them and loves them so much, she is able to grab it at put it back in her mouth herself.  I am still pregnant and hoping that my baby will love them as much as my friends baby did.  I love how soft they are and they are a good size, not too large and not too small.  Gotta love the sweet white lamb.
I bought the duck Wubbanub first as an intro pacifier after waiting 6 weeks to introduce pacis to avoid nipple confusion. I'd read a lot about Wubbanubs and Soothies (the pacifier brand attached to the Wubbanubs) being a great option for holding.<br /><br />LOVE Wubbanubs! Took a few days/weeks for little one to warm up to using a pacifier but she loves her Wubbanubs. I bought the tabby kitty to keep in her crib and we use the ducky for going out. The necks are easy to use a snap-on pacifier holder ( a friend had gotten us one from Etsy with a thick hairband on the end). They're super easy to grasp for little one. It was the first thing she learned to really grab well and to pull back into her mouth.<br /><br />They sit so well on her chest. I like the kitten over the ducky for this reason-  it's a bit wider so it sits really well. And I just realized I can (LOOSELY) tuck it into her swaddle so that it's easy to find again. I just did it for the first time and little one has been starting to go through a sleep regression and she just woke up, found it, and went back to sleep! Holy crap. Why didn't I try this sooner?!<br /><br />Anyways, I've tried regular pacifiers (even Soothies) since and she spits them right out. She liked to hold on to the little stuffed guys. I definitely recommend and I think I'm going to start getting them for baby shower presents, since you probably can't have too many.<br /><br />I will say, I wish I could take off the paci to boil but I wash it with hot water and soap every once in a while and throw it through the wash occasionally (especially the one we take out of the house). And I have stuck the tip into a boiling pot of water before too really quickly but watch you don't burn yourself with the steam.
I have use these with 2 of my 4 children and am pregnant now...due today actually...and plan to use these again!<br />Coming from a breastfeeding mom, I personally am not too concerned with if it is &#34;orthodontic&#34; or not. I know that sounds bad but this is why.... Nipple confusion! These closely resemble mom's and also resemble how most breast milk bottles are shaped. I don't let my babies hold on to a pacifier too long anyway so the &#34;orthodontic&#34; aspect doesn't really apply. Even if you're formula feeding, most of the bottles like Avent, Gerber or even Medela and other popular brands of bottles are still shaped the same.<br />In the other reviews I read, I saw a lot of moms have a problem finding pacifier clips or holders that fit.<br />Here's a solution..!<br />I haven't found any that hold these except the ones specially designed for Soothies. They have some by Booginhead that have a loop you saddle tie through the holes on the base. I, personally, dont care for these the way they suggest to use them. The loop rubs against baby's face and sits right where their mouth is wet. Just makes for a chapped face waiting to happen. SO, my solution, I used my husbands drill and drilled a hole in the tab and looped a Booginhead through that. Im sure you could use anything to put the hold there. If you do this, make sure its a SMALL hole and its low enough down to the base you dont have to worry about it breaking.<br />There are also some by Bella Tunno or Ulububu that clips on the tab. These don't hold too well but I guess its personal preference if you want a clip that slips or a loop that can chap :D<br />Personally, I think Soothie should put a hole in the tab themselves. :) Problem solved!<br />So, long and short of it, I think these are the best!!
these pouches are really great! we love them so much i just bought a second package. we have put all kinds of stuff in there, from homemade veggie and fruit purees to yogurt mixed with fruit to applesauce. all different textures do great in these--my daughter has no issues getting out even the thicker ones! all the things we used to feed her with a spoon we can now put in these pouches, making eating on the go, and at daycare, and feeding the baby when we're trying to cook dinner and eat too so much easier since she can do it herself. we have been using them for about a month and so far have not had any instances of the pouches opening when they shouldn't. they can go in the dishwasher, but we found we prefer to wash them by hand with the bottle brush. in the very bottom of the pouch where the bottom meets the sides, there is often food stuck in there that doesn't come out in the dishwasher (we just use the small brush part of our bottle brush to clean that part out without issue). also dirty water from the dishwasher cycle tends to collect in the outside of the pouch when we stand it upside down in the top rack--yuck! we send these to daycare, and since a few other moms have bought them after seeing how much we like ours, labeling is a must, but i have found that the sharpie washes off the name tag on the back. i solved that by putting a small piece of transparent tape over her name. i also really like the color and design--very thankful that they are not in cutesy shapes. also--do yourself a favor and when buying these (or for that matter, any refillable pouch) buy the funnel pitcher too. chunkier purees go in much cleaner and easier when using the pitcher. not necessary, but for less than $5, you'll be glad you did. this is a great product! buy some for yourself!
I breastfed my daughter for the first two weeks but unfortunately my supply was never established and she dropped almost a pound of her birth weight so we needed to supplement with formula.  She is now exclusively on formula.  When we needed to supplement, I had a horrible time trying to find a bottle that she would take.  I started with the Lanisoh bottles and the Medela bottles because they are supposed to be the best for breastfed babies.  She would not take either of them.  Then I tried First Years Breastflow bottles and Avent.  Again, she would not take either of them.  You can imagine how absolutely stressful this was with a baby who was not thriving.  Eventually we found Dr. Browns and she did take them relatively well, but she always spilled so much formula while eating because the nipples are small and she couldn't &#34;latch&#34; onto the bottle properly.  This made for a big mess and also for a lot of gas because she was sucking a lot of air while trying to eat.  These bottles have BY FAR been the best I have tried with her.  She rarely spills a drop and she is not really gassy on these bottles at all.  Plus, the inclusion of the pacifiers is a wonderful bonus as this is the ONLY paci she will take other than the weird looking Soothies.  She latches to these pacifiers the best, and yes, I have tried MANY MANY brands just as I did with bottles.  These bottles are easy to clean and having the ability to sanitize them in the microwave is a HUGE bonus!!  I find that they don't leak as long as they are assembled correctly.  I also enjoy having the ability to make a 5oz bottle - many bottles only go to 4oz in the smaller size.  Overall, I think these are the best bottles on the market and I highly recommend them.  They have pretty much literally been a lifesaver for us.
this product is amazing! i wish i had thought of this myself. for such a small investment i can now avoid buying the overpriced applesauce squeeze packets and yogurt tubes and buy these products in larger quantity and fill these pouches instead - all for a much cheaper price. if only these had been around when my children were babies and we were pureeing our own baby food.<br /><br />the packets are easy to clean-just take the cap off, open the top and run water through the pouch, then stick it in the dishwasher. if you pour the water in through the opening on the top the water comes out the open spout on the side. if you clean them shortly after use that is all you will need to do. if you leave the contents in a little longer then you can always use a small brush (bottle brush) to clean it out more rigorously before putting them in the dishwasher.<br /><br />i will say that my kids have a tendency to bite on the round opening/spout on the side (we're working on this) so then i have to bite it back in to place so i can fit the cap back on. not a big deal if your kids don't do this.<br /><br />the only slightly negative thing i can say about this product is that the top opening (interlocking zipper seal similar to ziploc bags) is hard to pull apart after the pouch has been sucked on and my husband pulled too hard one time and the seal ripped. this was after having the product for only a few days. but i still love this product so much that i just bought some more and am now a little more careful when opening them. plus, the customer service was great. when i told them about the rip in one of the bags they promptly sent me a 4 pack of replacement pouches and were very apologetic. so despite the issue i had, i still give this product 5 stars as my issue was rectified immediately.
the product itself is everything wonderful that you would expect from fisher-price. the colors are cheerful and fun and also unisex, which is a great bonus if you'd like to get plenty of use out of this item or eventually pass it along to someone else. the seat swivels so your baby can swing in either of two directions, front to back or side to side, whichever he or she finds more comforting. the little mirrored ball at the top and the spinning alligators and bird are lots of fun for baby to look at. the music is very nice, not annoying, and everything is adjustable - the volume of the music, the intensity of the swinging, the movement of the mobile, etc.<br /><br />what moms really love about this type of product though is how soothing a swing can be for their baby. some people use swings on a regular basis, but i tend to save it for \\special occasions\\ when there's something else i really need to get done, or if i need to get dressed and ready quickly. i'm able to set the baby in here, fire it up, and he stays happy and enthralled until we're ready to go. at first i thought it seemed like a lot of money to spend for something that the baby may or may not like, but i'm glad i paid attention to all the moms who wrote amazon reviews that claimed swings are an essential component in any nursery.<br /><br />the reason i selected this larger style swing instead of the \\papasan\\ variety is because it's comfortable for the baby for a longer time. even though i believe both styles are rated to accommodate babies within the same weight ranges, i believe the contouring and seat shape of this model will prove more comfortable for a longer period of time. the adjustable seat back and removable newborn padding insert will allow you to use this item from birth through many months after.
I was hesitant to buy this at first because we only use the Gumdrop Pacifiers and I didn't see how I could attach those to the bear. It took some effort but I WAS able to do it (see the pictures I uploaded in the product images).<br /><br />The directions I got with the bear state that it can be tossed in the washing machine - pacifier and all - but I have not done that. It's a personal preference, just not sure how safe it is to get laundry detergent on a pacifier, even if it's rinsed. So I wash the pacifier by hand with hot water and replace it when necessary.<br /><br />When I first bought this my baby (then 8 months) did not like this bear because it was a bit heavy and it kept pulling the pacifier out of her mouth. Within a few days, though, she really got used to it. Before buying this, I was going nuts in the dark trying to locate the pacifier in her crib, and the fact that she has designs on her crib sheets didn't help matters because it was easier to lose among them! I purchased this bear to solve my problem, and it solved my baby's problem, too - when she starts crying at night she locates the bear (easy enough to do, even half asleep), puts the pacifier in her mouth and falls back asleep in no time. This bear is a lifesaver!<br /><br />EDIT: Dec/2013 - I recently had to replace this for my almost 2-year-old as she broke the loop. The original one I bought came in a drawstring bag with the green pacifier pictured as well as a clear plastic flat pacifier that looked like a teether. Now I spent more money (originally bought for around $11, this time bought for $15) and the pacifier pictured and the teether pacifier no longer comes with it. They really cheaped out and raised the price. I'm disappointed. Still a great product but not as pictured! I'd give this 4-stars now.
this is the #1 played with toy everyday! every child should have one! best investment ever! we first bought this when my son was 1 and at the time lived in a condo with no yard and didn't have a play center. this was the perfect solution for bringing an outdoor activity inside! easy installation, never even screwed anything in, it's just pressure mounted and believe me, my 185 lbs husband hung on it and it can hold him! we have the infant swing, the strap swing, the trapeze bar and the hammock i can swing in it with both my kids ages 2 and 4. hammock is awesome for little babies, it rocks them to sleep and they are deep enough it cradles them. love it so much bought another bar for my baby girl and can swing them both at the same time. now, my 5yr old son swings on it everyday since he was 1. so even though it may seem pricey for a swing ask yourself, how many toys does your children play with the same toy for 4 over years? probably till he's 9, i would say that's the best investment ever! i love it so much even took it on the plane to grandparents house for the other kiddos cause it snows there and everyone loves it too!  note: they recently (maybe 1-2 years) had a safety upgrade on the infant swing, a simple bar and 2 o rings in front to prevent safety straps from shifting/ sliding which may result in positioning baby sideways also doubles as a toy bar to hang toys from. i wasn't aware of this and they gave me upgrade for free, so careful when buying somewhere else online and not direct from the company make sure you have this safety upgrade if not contact them  they are a awesome company, personally spoke with one of the original inventors and he is a family man too and cares and treats his company like family, they were so nice, helpful and eager to please. awesome product from awesome company.
we love, love this car seat!  we bought this one when we realized how great our first roundabout 55 was.  so, we have two now... one for each car.  we didn't want to hassle with switching the car seat over each time we took a different car.  and since our decision was to install using the lap-shoulder belt instead of the latch system, installation takes a few more minutes than we have on a daily basis.  we switched our baby over to this car seat at about 6 mo old, but i can see how this seat would also accommodate a much smaller baby too.  we plan for him to use this until he outgrows it and moves into a booster.  my only concern is whether or not he will outgrow this before he can safely sit in a booster.  the seat seems to fit him perfectly now, so i wonder how much growing he can do before he's too big.  and, we're almost already using the entire strap length (not much more slack to pull out).  however, we had these concerns prior to deciding on purchasing this car seat (and then purchasing a second), and we are still entirely happy with this purchase.  i still would not buy anything else while having these concerns.  the quality is wonderful.  i have experience with other brands that our son's grandparents have in their vehicles, and i can say that i'd never buy any of them instead.  you can't even compare the quality and comfort.  the other britax models are great too, but we couldn't spend $300+ on a car seat when we needed to buy two.  plus, a friend of mine has the model with the built in head supports, and because her son was so tall, he was forced to use a different car seat because his shoulders were uncomfortable.  we figured we were safest if we just went with the basic model, which has proven so far to be a good decision.  highly recommend, as we will be repeat purchasers of this car seat.
i hesitated to buy these bumpers after reading the reviews here, but i'm glad that i took a chance and bought them!  some of the reviews made it sound like the bumpers would collapse at the slightest touch and then remain collapsed and have to be adjusted frequently, but i haven't found this to be the case.  as long as the bumpers are put on correctly - i.e. tightly, with the panels overlapping as per the instructions - this is not a problem at all.  i am delighted at how these bumpers look and work.<br /><br />as for the look, my son's room features chocolate brown, light blue and some yellow, and these bumpers look great with the velour chocolate brown sheet in his crib - they're a really nice shade of light blue.<br /><br />as for the function, make sure the edge of the bumper is just below the top of mattress; this will help keep the bumpers in place, as well as prevent little hands and feet from getting under the bumper.  you should also make sure to install these tightly when you velcro them around the crib rails; this will allow the bumpers to spring back into position quickly after little legs and arms push down on them.<br /><br />i like that my baby can see through the bumper a little and look around his room as he likes when he wakes up in the morning.  now that he's standing, of course, he usually looks over the bumper instead of through it, but at least i know he can stand there safely, unable to use the bumpers to try to climb out.<br /><br />the only thing i don't like about this product is that changing the sheets tends to pull it out of place, as the mattress fits very tightly in the crib and rubs against the railing coming out and when it's being put back in.  but this is a problem i would have with any bumper given how tightly the mattress fits into the crib.  overall, i love these bumpers!
i've only used this on restaurant high chairs so far, but it's been great. my son is big for his age and started sitting up on his own at about 4.5 months, but we still thought he was too small to comfortably sit in a wooden high chair. a friend recommended this cart cover, so we got it and we love it! it's so soft and plush that he is very comfortable, and now he can sit at the restaurant table with us while we eat. (before, my husband and i would each have to take turns holding him and eating since he hated sitting in his car seat or a stroller at a restaurant.)<br /><br />before we bought this one, we checked out other, less expensive covers. we're happy we got this one because it has the following advantages:<br />1. it is very soft and plush (as i said before), so it pads the seat a bit for your little one.<br />2. it straps to the chair, and has its own little strap that holds the child in (it's like a little triangle-shaped piece of fabric that you put his feet through and straps around his waist, so it really keeps him in there! i've seen toddlers crawl out of restaurant high chairs and onto the table, so i think this feature would come in handy for children older than mine, too).<br />3. the tags! our baby loves them. we also use them as loops to attach links ([[asin:b001abzgu2 bright starts lots of links]]) and toys for our son.<br /><br />the main disadvantage to this cart cover is that it's kind of big. that's no big deal when we're taking it out in the car, but we like to walk places too. so, we purchased a 4l stuff sack ([[asin:b000sthhqi sea to summit ultra-sil stuff sack]], size s) for it, which makes it small enough to squeeze into the diaper bag when we're walking out for dinner. i'd recommend getting one if you're a walker too!<br /><br />we love our cart cover! i'm sure it will be great when we use it on an actual cart, too ;)
LOVE IT!!!<br /><br />I had no idea what these were for.  I thought they were just stuffed animals attached to pacifiers.  I didn't realize I needed one until I was at the pediatricians office with my two month old and another mom showed me what they did while my daughter kept spitting out her pacifier.  Quickly, I ran to amazon and purchased the pacifier.  It took a couple days to come in but the shipping was super fast and I immediately cleaned it and put it to use.  It works great.  My two month old is just getting to the stage where she is starting to grab for things in reach and she likes her pacifier sometimes when she is over tired (despite my best efforts for naps) to help her settle down.  I haven't used it in the car yet, which is where I need it most, but I'm sure it'll be great.  It's nice that it stays in range and when she spits her paci out she can easily get it back in with a little effort.<br /><br />The only downfall I see with the design of the product is that you can't take the paci off to really clean it.  Yes you can wash it in soapy water like the instructions say and I did that.  I just wish I could run it through my dishwasher like I do the other things to make sure it's really sterilized.  But, then I'm kinda germaphobic when it comes to my little one.  Definitely worth the price and definitely a great idea.<br /><br />The fabric is super soft and the little caterpillar is just the right size that my daughter's tiny hands can really grab onto it.  She seems to like the soft feel.  The little feet have beans in them so that it helps the animal stay on her chest when she is laying in her car seat or swing and needs a little extra soothing.  The pacifier is sewn into the stuffed animal part so there is no worry about fingers or anything getting caught in a loop or something like that.  The fabrics are bright and cute.  I love the little thing!
I loved that my baby can hug the small stuffed animal and tuck the pacifier. She loved it. It is machine washable and as soon as you take it out, it does not really need to be dried as it is dried already and is ready to be used.<br />I thought it was a bigger giraffe and was disappointed at first to see it so tiny, but I believe it is the appropriate size for an infant not to choke on. It is a pricey ($13-$14 ea.). Wish it was half price, and wish I could replace pacifiers on the stuffed animal, but can not, since it is sewed with stitches to the giraffe.<br /><br />BabyHaven is really professional and nice. When I received other regular Soothie pacifiers in damaged boxes, they offered to send me replacements for free. Hoping to receive them soon by mail.<br />----------------------------------------<br />Edited April 8, 2013:<br />I now have an Amazon Prime Membership with my Amazon Mom membership, I receive everything in 2 days and can return items with no hassle. Back when I bought the Wubbanub and Avent Soothie Pacifiers from BabyHaven, I thought they proposed to send me free pacifiers to replace the damaged packages I received but they did not and wanted me to pay for the return shipping rate. They said since product is not damage it is my responsibility. They tucked 6 Avent soothie pacifiers and 3 wubbanub pacifiers in one small bubbly envelop!!! The Avent Soothie's package was ruined but they did not care.<br />They were not so professional what so ever.<br /><br />We are treated better when we get the Prime Membership as we deal with Amazon directly versus with the seller. Packaging is better, as they send in a boxes even small ones versus in an envelop that gets ur package damaged from shipping.<br /><br />Would still recommend the product though. My daughter stopped taking the pacifier around 4 months, but she loves to play with the tiny stuffed animal and chew on it sometimes :) So cute!
I bought this when my son was a couple weeks old because he favored soothie pacifiers and I loved the idea of being able to more easily find the pacifier, having something my son could hold onto, and having something that sort of propped up the pacifier while he was too young to keep it in his mouth well enough on his own.<br /><br />This has met all those expectations wonderfully! I've since purchased two more for when my son drops his in gross places and they need to go through the washing machine. In between washes in the washing machine I wash only the pacifier part and it's not too difficult. Once in a while the tip of the giraffe's nose gets wet but that's not a big deal and it dries quickly.<br /><br />I should mention that I've seen other WubbaNubs and knockoff WubbaNubs and so far the giraffe is my son's very favorite. It's longer than the others and narrower and more easily stays on his chest. Now that he's 7 months old that's not important because he can keep the pacifier in his mouth and he can also put it back in his mouth if it falls out. But when he was smaller it was just the perfect size to sit and stay on his chest. He also loved holding the giraffes ears. When he first learned to grab at things he'd grab the giraffes ears happily and by default would hold the pacifier in his mouth better as he was falling asleep.<br />I only add these things because choosing which adorable stuffed animal part was difficult but I had to keep getting the giraffe because of those reasons!<br /><br />One more reason to get this is that once babies can reach for things and put things in their mouth these are even more amazing. My son drops his and can easily find it and put it back in his mouth. He also loves to play with it as a toy! I can imagine him loving this for a long time, long after outgrowing pacifiers.<br /><br />Best purchase. I don't know how I would have made it through the infant months without these!!!
[[ASIN:B004IY6AGW Mary Meyer Ella Bella Elephant Wubbanub]]<br /><br />I LOVE WUBBANUB'S! What more could I say? This is my second Wubbanub purchase.I ordered one for DBG before she was born with hopes that she would take to it and she did!We have used our first one which was a small pink monkey now for nearly three months and it has been through a lot and still holding up.I wanted to have another as a back up.I ordered the ELLA BELLA Wubbanub because it was just too cute.We finally got it and I am very pleased with it.It is super soft and super cute.It is a good size not too small and not too big...just right and it's not heavy at all,just enough weight to it to help it stay where you want it to.I washed it and tried to give it to DBG and she would have nothing to do with it :( to my suprise.I decided to let her sleep with it for a few days along with her monkey Wubbanub and it worked! I realized that the reason she did not take to the new one at first was because it did not smell familar to her.Now she loves it as much as her monkey and I can wash the other one finally...as she will not do without one :) It is PERFECT in every way,it's a pacifier and her lovey/security,she will only take the pacifier when she's sleepy but she will grasp the legs and hold on tight and cuddle with it.BEST OF ALL: I don't have to dig for a paci EVER!It is so easy to find any time any where.She has a hard time holding one in her mouth(preemie) and this helps her to keep it there and when she does not want it she can just move her head and it falls out/away but stays with her.These are very durable.One of my baby shower gifts from now on.<br />Suggestion on washing:I take a mesh bag(zipped) or pillowcase(tied at the end) and drop the Wubbanub in and throw it in the washing machine on gentle cycle,let it air dry then wash the pacifier with warm/hot soapy water or use a pacifier wipe and we are good to go.<br />I HIGHLY SUGGEST THIS ITEM OR ANY WUBBANUB :)
this has been the perfect bassinet for our baby. my wife and i looked at numerous stand alone bassinets and decided to go with the chicco playard because we could not justify buying an expensive bassinet that we would only use for a few months and we also did not want something cheap. we were a little hesitant to buy this playard because we were unsure of how well it would work as a bassinet, but it has been great. our baby has no problem falling asleep and the little mattress is perfectly comfortable (it is also washable).<br /><br />setup was easy, even though i read several reviews saying it was a pain in the butt. for the most part it was self explanatory and it only takes a few minutes to break down for transporting.<br /><br />the best part of this playard is it's functionality. the changing pad hangs over one side so when the baby needs to be changed, just flip it over and it's ready (it says to buckle the changing pad down, but i don't leave the baby alone so i don't bother). when i'm finished changing the baby, just flip it back over the side and it's out of the way. there are also several very convenient pockets to store diapers, wipes, cream, etc. right below the changing pad area.<br /><br />other great features include the wheels on one side for easy transporting of the unit around the house as well as the night light, vibrations, and music. we are also at ease leaving her in this bassinet because of the mesh all the way around her (no fear of her sufficating when she is able to roll over.<br /><br />i will continue using this for our future children and it will be a great playard when it's no longer needed as a bassinet. i highly recommend this product over any stand alone bassinet. let me also clarify that our baby is sleeping in our room and not her nursery, so there is not a changing table in our room. if you have a changing table in the room your baby will be sleeping in, then this may not be as useful to you as it has been for me.
Let me start by saying the nipple part of the pacifier is long-gone.  She bit holes it years ago, as her teeth were coming in.  I snipped off the rest down to the base, and that was the end of pacifiers for her.  But it wasn't the end of the kitty...<br /><br />In the beginning, WubbaNub pacifiers were a LIFE-SAVER for us!  Our younger daughter was born with a horrific case of reflux.  It was strongly suggested by many professionals that she use a pacifier to help keep the acid from bothering her too much.  But what a pain it was to keep popping it back in ever few minutes, especially during the night (not that she was sleeping all that much--again, due to the reflux).  Duct tape was jokingly considered.<br /><br />An internet search eventually lead me to the WubbaNub website, and I found a local dealer to buy from (they weren't on Amazon back then).  She was 3 months old when she got her first kitty, and a back-up kitty followed several months later.  The rest is history.<br /><br />When she was a baby, it worked fantastically!  It wasn't too long before she learned to push the pacifier back into her own mouth and save me the trouble.  It was a little lighter weight than I had expected, but it still worked wonderfully.<br /><br />When we bought it, we had NO idea that we were getting her a friend for life.  And what a life it's had!  As of today, the nipple is gone (only a green ring remains), the rear left leg has no more stuffing in it and is pretty thoroughly mangled (she likes to rub it between her fingers as she falls asleep), the coloring has faded a bit, and I just noticed that the stitching along the spine is starting to show slightly.  But after all these years, and all the LOVE it's received, I'm not surprised by the wear-and-tear.  Honestly, I'm a little shocked it's held up so well.<br /><br />To say this is her favorite lovie/toy would be putting it lightly.  Some day, she may choose to put it on the shelf and be done with it, but that day isn't any time soon.  :)
i have a three month old and the amount of stuff we have to take on a day outing is crazy!  i pack a lot of stuff. probably more then i need, but i like to feel prepared.  i have a cute little diaper bag, but that is just it, it was too small to take if i was going out for more then a few hours.<br /><br />in this backpack i can fit: house bottle warmer, car charger bottle warmer, jacket, hand pump, sunscreen, beg spray, small cereal container, small toys(3), 10 size 1 diapers, wipes, baggies to put dirty diapers in, changing pad, thermometer, diaper rash cream, gripe water, gas drops, pacifiers, three outfits, 2 receiving blankets, and 2 bottles.  most of the time i also out my cell phone and wallet in the big pocket too.<br /><br />the main compartment it huge!  i can fit so much into it.  the half circle pocket on the top is bigger then it looks and i keep cloths in it.  the large side pockets i use for diapers and changing pads.  i do not use the hard wipe case that came with the bag.  i put on of the soft disposable wipe packs into it and so far it works great.  the two pockets that i have not quite mastered filling are the sipper pocket on the flap and the one under the half circle.  the sipper pocket on the flap is small.  i have put pacifiers, keys, and cellphones in it but none seem to fit quite right.  the pocket below the circle pocket i have put the health care stuff, cell phone, keys, cloths, sun hats, but again nothing seems quite right.  the best fit for this pocket so far is the sunhat and sunglasses for the baby.<br /><br />overall, this bag is amazing!  so roomy and easy to full.  to help my husband when i ask him to find something i got key chains that can be written on and attached them to each pocket. i have listed what is in the pocket so he or a sitter can easily locate what they need.<br /><br /> it is a great bag for me to take to town or take to the baby sitters for the day.  it also worked well on vacation.  i was able to keep it upfront with me and i had what ever i needed.
The Wubbanub Monkey is great!!! Regular pacifiers fall out when the baby starts sucking on it and starts to pop it up and down in their mouth.  Very frustrating to keep putting back in their mouth especially while you're trying to get them to sleep.<br /><br />With the wubbanub monkey pacifier, you can spread out it's legs so the pacifier stays in her mouth as she pops it in and out.  The head weighs it down just enough to keep it in.  The position of the pacifier sewed into the monkey's mouth is a good angle to help it stay in.  I heard from friends that some of the other animals are not as good as the monkey for the angle.  The monkey is small and light enough that when she's turning her head back and forth (fighting to not go to sleep) and it gets on her face, she can still breathe just fine.<br /><br />I tried the pacifier clip before purchasing the monkey. The clip works well to keep it from dropping on the floor, but doesn't help with keeping it in her mouth.<br /><br />FYI: this does not keep it in her mouth all the time.  At times, she likes to grab it, yank it out, and sometimes toss it.  But it works well most of the time.  I'd buy it again.<br /><br />She's now almost 4 months old and has been able to grab it and get it into her mouth a few times.  She also loves to suck on it's legs and tail now that she's a little older.  So we only need one item to go out instead of a toy and pacifier.<br /><br />Other sleep suggestions:  From birth to about 2 months old, she just wasn't sleeping well at all, she constantly woke herself up when her arms would suddenly move - it startled her.  So with much trial and error, I found the solution to my baby sleeping all night: this swaddle sleepsack (her arms stopped waking her up), her monkey wubbanub pacifier (monkey keeps it in her mouth as she pops it in and out (most of the time), munchkin nursery projector/sound machine turned to heartbeat & projector, mattress at a slight angle (seemed to reduce reflux) = baby sleeping all night 6-10 hrs!!!! PRAISE the LORD for sleep!!!
Ordered it 4 days ago and just received it today from RideOnDepot.com for 416.98 and no shipping. They have a pricey 25% restocking fee but after reading up on the 20 wheel double jogger, I felt the great write ups and the good deal they offered outweighed the risk of return. Was a little confusing to set up at first until I realized most of what the instructions said to do was already done. Pretty much just had to slide a couple of frame pieced together and pop the wheels on. Took the 16 month old twins out for a test drive. You very much get what you pay for! <br />Great lightweight stroller for running with the kiddies! Holds the road true and bends and sways a little with you and the road (a good thing). Our neighbor gave us their old InStep which they've outgrown and it pulled to the right, and was just not comfortable for running. While it's also great for walking (I also put a CD player in the under basket with Vivaldi's Four Seasons or something else calming for the kids like George Winston) if that's all one is going to do then one of those cheaper strollers with the flimsey swivel front wheel may be the better way to go. But if you're going to run some of the time with it, this is the best we've checked out. I assume the kids like it also as they were out in minutes. <br />Lighweight, holds the road great, I set the tires at about 43 lbs (40 to 65lb range) and the ride/run was comfy. Not fatiguing at all! Pleant of pockets for cell phone, water, cd player, even brought the mail in one of the pockets, great canopies and safety features: hand brakes, two wheel locks and wrist strap in case you fall on a hill and the red color stands out to passing motorists, I wasn't sure about the res at first but it really looks sharp against the black <br />it's a little pricier than we were planning on going but it's well worth every penny! Other than that I can't think of a con just yet. Maybe if don't have double doors like us and you need to bring it inside, you maywant to look into their easily collapsible Q model. <br />
i have two kids, a daughter who's 10, and a son who is now almost 6 weeks old.  as much as i wanted to breastfeed my daughter, it just didn't work out, and i think the bottles she was given early on were a huge part of the problem.  bottles require only sucking (no compression) and make the baby a \\lazy eater\\.  breastfeeding requires a lot of work (sucking the nipple to the back of the mouth, waiting for let down, compression, sucking, etc.) and if a baby has used a bottle, they can often times get frustrated trying to go back to the breast.  for this reason, i waited until my son was 4 weeks, before introducing any bottles.  even though i'd given him time to get a good latch, establish good breastfeeding, etc. i was honestly still pretty scared of bottles.  i know it's rare, but there are times that one bottle ruins baby's breastfeeding, and that was my worst nightmare.  i mean, the first week of breastfeeding is no party, and i was finally to the \\enjoyable\\ part.  after tons and tons of research, i purchased these bottles, and to my surprise - no issues.  first of all, he took this bottle right away, as if he couldn't even tell the difference between this and his normal \\food source\\.  he sucked it down, ate the whole thing (which was only 2 ounces since we were \\testing\\ them) and was still hungry.  i offered him my breast, and he took it instantly.  no weird latch issues, nothing off - perfect.  we've since given him several bottles over the last couple weeks, and everything has gone just as well.  so glad we decided on these bottles.  i can't say what would/wouldn't have happened if we'd gone with another brand, but i do know that there is nothing more i could have hoped for with these.  i also know that my niece tried several bottles on her ebf daughter, before trying these, which are the first ones she took!  i see other reviewers complaining of the \\extra part\\ (since there are essentially 2 parts to the nipple) but that is such a non-issue, really.  it isabsolutely worth one more part to be able to use these fantastic bottles!
i originally bought the saftey first air protect when my 9 month old outgrew her infant car seat about a month ago. i ended up returning the air protect for the following reasons:  1) it did not fit well in the rear-facing position in the back middle seat in our 2005 nissan pathfinder. the front seats had to be scooted up concomfortably close to the dash and the car seat was still not 100% level to ground due to the length of the car seat. it was also very difficult to tighten properly even when i kneeled on the seat and yanked with all my might.  2) the straps were constantly getting twisted. probably every other time i put her in our took her out i was untwisting those *!*# straps. a safety issue--no. but a real pain in the butt when errand running is already inconvenient enough--yes.  3) in the beginning, my daughter cried every time i put her in it. she just did not seem to be entirely comfortable in it.    when i received the advocate cs and opened the (smashed) box, my heart sank because it is a huge seat and i did not think it would fit any better than the air protect. fortunately, i was wrong and the advocate installed very easily and with plenty of room to spare. i was able to tighten the seat very tightly, i think due to having tightening straps on both sides. (i did have to use a towel underneath to make the base level which was also the case with the air protect). the straps have yet to twist and my daughter's head rests in a comfortable position. the seat is very cushy yet supportive and the adjustable straps are definitely a plus.    this car seat is simply a cut above the rest. it has all of the best safety features with little extras (belly pad, recline lever, easy-remove seat cover, etc) that make it an easy seat to use and own. yes, it is heavy (21 pounds), but it weighs less than my daughter so that is not an issue for me. and yes, it is expensive but in my opinion a car seat is not an area to look for a bargain. i am very happy with this seat andam relieved that the stress of trying to find the perfect car seat for our daughter is over.
I bought this crib tent when my two year old started trying to get out of her crib.  Once she knew she could do it, bedtime became a nightmare.  I didn't think she was mature enough to stay in a toddler bed.  And I was having a terrible time sleeping myself worrying that she would get out of her crib and would have free rein in the house.  I was concerned by some of the reviews saying it was poorly constructed, but I was desperate.  I have to say I love it!  My daughter things it's great when I put her in it, she'll even lift the flap for me to zip it sometimes.  She fusses when it's time to lay down.  But that's the same with the tent or without.  She seems to fall asleep more quickly with the tent.  I'm guessing that's partly because she can't throw her comfort items (blanket, lovey and seahorse) out, and partly because she knows she really doesn't have another option.  Instead of trying to get out of the crib, she just lays down.  I will agree the instructions could be better.  It took me longer than I would have liked to put it together. As for those with the zipper troubles, I almost wonder if they had the velcro too tight.  I know the first couple of times I zipped and unzipped it, I was really concerned. (It was like zipping up luggage that was too full.) But when I loosened the velcro holding it to the front rail, the zipper action was much smoother.  I have only had it for 6 weeks.  So I can not speak to it's long term durability.  But so far I am pleased.  The biggest cons I have with this crib tent would be that the zipper is loud.  I usually take out her musical seahorse, and cover her up before I go to bed.  I try to be as quiet as I can, but it sometimes makes her stir.  Thankfully it hasn't woken her up yet.  The other con is using it with a video baby monitor. The mesh makes it hard for the monitor camera to see in the crib.  I had to move the camera several times before finding somewhere that gave me a reasonable view.  For us, the pros of this product far outweigh the cons. Sleep is a precious commodity at our house. It was worth every penny we paid for this crib tent for her to get better sleep, thereby allowing me to get better sleep.
the things i love about these monitors:<br /><br />-you can adjust the sensitivity (setting ranges from 1-5) so that the monitor does not pick up the sound of a white noise machine or fan in your baby's room (a definite plus! if you've ever had a monitor without this feature, you'll know what i mean). i keep ours on a sensitivity of 2 (low), and it doesn't pick up the noise machine, but it does pick up my baby's soft babbling when she wakes up from a nap. perfect!<br /><br />-the batteries on the parent units last a loooooong time. we keep ours plugged in most of the time, but when we have occasionally unplugged them, the battery stays charged for days and days. when we have traveled out of town, we take one baby unit and one parent unit without the plug, and we have never had an issue with the battery running low. awesome!<br /><br />-the parent units have lights across the top so you can &#34;see&#34; if your baby is making noise even if you have the volume all the way down. there are definitely times this has come in handy (say you want to give your baby 15 minutes to soothe him/herself to sleep, but in the meantime you want to have a conversation with your spouse, watch a movie, or do something without the sound of crying baby in your ear. you can enjoy this quiet while still keeping an eye on how your baby is doing).<br /><br />-the units are well-made and sturdy. we also have a video monitor (different brand), and a couple times i have dropped that unit on the floor, i cringe, afraid it will break. with these units, there is no such worry. multiple drops, no problems.<br /><br />-the &#34;talk&#34; feature is nice (you can push a &#34;talk&#34; button on either parent unit, and it will broadcast to the baby unit and the other parent unit). the one downside (as others have mentioned) is that you can't just talk freely between the two parent units while your baby is asleep, but that's the only downside. if i am in the baby's room and my husband is downstairs, ican ask him a question without yelling down the stairs, and he can answer back through the monitor. very nice.<br /><br />overall, i have been beyond pleased with this monitor and would recommend it to anyone!
When I was prego I bought EVERY kind of ortho pacifiers for my soon to be baby boy. Little did I know that the hospital would stick a binkie in my baby's mouth as soon as he came out to the world.<br /><br />At first (my son's a preemie) they had to cut a portion of the paci so it didn't block his airway - this thing was almost 1/2 the size of his head. I tried switching him to other pacis, useless, either he couldn't grip it, or he'd spit it out.<br /><br />We didn't have any problems (like other parents) with him latching to the paci, only to breastfeed - but if you do have problems - try tickling/stroking their chin/jawline. It made my kiddo open up to feed, but with this paci, i think he could smell it a mile away.<br /><br />I can TOTALLY see why he'd like this, the nipple is shaped like a real nipple. It's easy for them to use and get full suction/grip on it.<br /><br />It comes in a variety of colors, but for some reason, the blue ones were way harder/thicker than the green ones. My son won't use any of them other than the green ones. There's also a paci holder - it's really cute, it turns the paci into a smiley face and it snaps on to a penguin or a flower. Super adorable.<br /><br />What I Don't like:<br />After we left the hospital - (we only snagged 3 of these pacis) - they were hard to find. Every chain/grocery store were sold out, and what we did find, we bought all of. As soon as we lost one or couldn't give one to my son when he needed it, the world literally would end. This was a peace offering to calm a very tyrannical baby. So i'm glad that Amazon carries it. We no longer have to keep track of pacis like our car keys and wallet. PHEW!<br /><br />Soothie also makes bottles. If your baby has a hard time drinking out of them (or just wouldn't latch (like my son did - avent, maam, medela, gerber, nuk) then get their bottles. Same nipple shape and comes in 2 different sizes.<br /><br />TEETH:<br />My son is almost 2 now and I was scared that because these were ortho pacis, that he'd have buck teeth or just out of line. I'm wrong. Kid has straight teeth. He still uses his paci in the morning and to fall asleep.f line. I'm wrong. Kid has straight teeth. He still uses his paci in the morning and to fall asleep.
i was given the unit as part of a test program that motorola was conducting.  i love this product!  it works very much like their top end product the mbp 36 which i bought from amazon last year.  here is a brief description of my experience.<br /><br />first off,  i thought the price was crazy high,  but after doing some research i realized that it was actually a value.  the summer connect is $229.99 and it doesnt have pan, zoom or tilt and the i baby is $199.99 and doesnt come with pan, zoom or tilt and it doesnt work with me droid x. - only an apple product,  so for the few bucks more,  i get pan, zoom and tilt and it works with android.  and just for a few bucks more i get the quality and technology of motorola.  there is also the drop cam unit at $149.99 - no pan, zoom or tilt and it has a monthly service charge.<br /><br />one of the first things i noticed when i got the product is the easy of setup.  i have tried the units above,  and the motorola unit is the only one that i could setup in minutes.  you download the free app,  and the app actually walks you through the setup.  its extremely easy!!  you dont have to be a tech wizard to set it up,  the others i needed a degree in computer mechanics.<br /><br />some of the features that it has:<br /><br />pan, zoom and tilt - its the exact same camera as my mbp 36.  super quiet motor and moves almost a full 360' around.<br />very hq picture<br />night vision<br />2 way communication<br />temp of the room and a temp warning if the room gets too hot or cold for the baby.  great feature<br />audio alert push notice<br />lullabies - they have 5 pre loaded tunes.  be nice if i could play my music.  its one of the recommendations i suggested.<br />takes pictures on your phone<br />take video on your phone<br /><br />other note worthy things:<br /><br />its a free app<br />free service - no monthly monitoring fees<br />4 cameras on 1 account.  -  i have already ordered more cameras,  cant wait to set up more rooms.<br />works on wi fi or cellular service.  you can use it anywhere.  i used it on a plane last week at 35,000 feet,  checking in at home.  was so cool.<br /><br />bottom line its pricey but totally worth it and everyone i show it too cant wait to get one.  i highly recommend it!
love this projector!!! i bought it from wal-mart for the list price of $12.88 and it is well worth it! i don't know about younger babies but i bought this for my 9 month old daughter as she is hard to get to sleep lately even by rocking her and this thing will put her out faster than i ever could! i use the music mode on low to get her sleepy then when that gets her sleepy i switch it over to nature sounds.<br /><br />pros...my daughter loves it.<br />  it sings a little as well as plays music and nature sounds.<br />  the rotating bears projection is super cute.<br />  it's cheap and easily affordable.<br />  can keep the volume on lowest setting if switch it automatically from music to nature sounds without turning it off first. it resets if turn it to off position before changing it. if turns offer on its own it stays on the sound setting you put it on.<br />has button on front so your baby can turn it back on if you are asleep and he or she wakes up and wants music.<br /><br />cons..... the strap is super hard to figure out if don't read the instructions. you have to double loop it for it to catch in the holes and stay.<br />  it is loud even on the lowest setting but my daughter doesn't mind it as long as i switch it to nature sounds when she starts falling asleep.<br />the batteries do wear out fast that it comes with. mine lasted a week after i bought it. i freaked out to as when the batteries get low the projection will refuse to stay on but the music and sound still work..leading to you automatically thinking it broke when you just need new batteries. it takes 3 aa batteries and i suggest getting the rechargeable kind so won't have to keep running to the store.<br />the image when you first buy it appears blurry. mine did. try changing the batteries. the picture got a lot clearer and the sound less wobbly after put in some new energizers.<br /><br />overall this projector has exceeded my expectations and gives me some free time as it does the singing and entertaining before nap or bedtime for me. glad invested the money. just don't know why amazon is selling it so high. me and baby girl love it!tertaining before nap or bedtime for me. glad invested the money. just don't know why amazon is selling it so high. me and baby girl love it!
We used Nuk orthodontic solid piece silicone pacifiers until he outgrew them around 5-6 months. I loved that they were one piece (easier to clean), silicone, and orthodontic. I went on a pacifier hunt for several months until I finally found these! These are the almost-perfect replacements. All other pacifiers in our house have been tossed.<br /><br />Here's what we like:<br /> - The nipple has an orthodontic shape that my son doesn't spit out (which to me means it's a good fit). It also has a bit of give so the nipple can be sucked in a little harder if wanted; occasionally my son will play with that feature. I assume it simulates the flex of mom's nipple. Also, the narrow part of the nipple (between the lips/gums) is slightly textured. This also helps the pacifier stay in baby's mouth.<br /> - Although these pacifiers are not one solid piece, the silicone part is very wide and covers the whole mouth area. If you've ever used a pacifier where the mouthpiece connects directly to the plastic shield, you've likely seen just how nasty they can get at the connecting area- where you can't clean it!<br /> - The solid vertical 'bar' on the shield is great. It doesn't stick out so far that it gets knocked out, yet it's easy for my son to grab it to pull it out and put it back in. You can also use a pacifier holder there (like the BooginHead PaciGrip).<br /> - The mouth shield has just enough dip under the nose and curve to the cheeks to fit nicely without digging in anywhere. My son has big cheeks and some pacifiers dig in on the sides; this one doesn't.<br /><br />Ultimately any pacifier that stays in and can be thoroughly cleaned is a huge WIN! in my book. My son is 12 months and the 6+ months size is still great for him. It probably would've been a little too big right at the 6 month mark but babies grow fast.<br /><br />The negative reviews here are due to the colors may vary lack of color choice- not due to the pacifier itself. Yes I wish amazon let us choose- but sometimes you just don't have that option, and you as a consumer take a chance that you may not love the colors. Deal with it!! We've bought 5 packs over a couple of months and received: 3 red/blue, 1 green/teal, and 1 pink/purple. I'll likely save the pink/purple for a gift- or in case or pacifier emergency!
i bought this on sale at ross for a ridiculously low price of $10 because the outer box was dented. my closet is done in a slightly darker green, so this matched really well and gave me a surprising amount of extra space. the small hangers are good for my small tank tops with spaghetti straps and some of my decorated bras and bikinis but they are too small for most other grownup clothing. this is meant for a baby closet and i am an adult with no kids, however, i am also a size 2 and petite so a lot of my clothing is really small, i also have a ton of tank tops, skinny jeans and tiny shirts.<br /><br />this worked really well for me, especially when i added some taller bins for the bottom with jeans and shorts and i put the matching ones from this set on the upper level with some light scarves, belts and other accessories. the dividers and labels also came in handy for organizing the various colors and types of clothing. my closet is huge and i bought a green striped ikea organizing set years ago and this was the only other thing i ever found to remotely match it.<br /><br />once i put it in my closet, you can't tell it is for a baby because i use it on the side with smaller clothing items. it added some much needed space and looks a lot more organized and neat. i normally would never think to look in the baby section for organizing solutions but in this case, i am glad i was passing through the kid's aisle and noticed this color would match the stuff i already had. it seems sturdy enough for my petite clothing and probably works well for lighter weight baby and kids clothing. this is maybe not the thing to buy if you wear plus sized clothing but for babies, kids, small teens and someone my size, it is sturdy and large enough to add a good amount of extra storage.<br /><br />this was for sure my cheapest closet makeover ever! i think this set was around $10 and the extra bins were $5....15 bucks is not bad considering i spent around $100 on the ikea organizing set. my size 2 and 3 shorts and jeans fit perfectly on the shelves or in bins when folded but any larger and you probably need a teen or adult size organizer. i would totally recommend this to parents but not for most adults unless your clothing is tiny like mine is. if you are petite, then it's a great bargain!
This is a great pacifier. It is ideal for breastfed babies. That is why it is one of the top pacifiers recommended by docs and hospitals.<br /><br />Even though my baby and I love this pacifier (it is the only one that we use) and I highliy recommend it, I do want think it is important to highlight some of the shortcomings/warnings that people should know about. But even with these problems, it is still the best option out there.<br /><br />Things you should know (but the pacifier is still worth it):<br />1) hard to hold: the little tiny tab on the back is really hard for a parent to find and hold. I have dropped this pacifier many times when trying to hold the little tab.<br />2) it is hard to clip: It is hard to find something to clip and keep this pacifier tied to baby. But that is the point. It is not recommended to stap the pacifier to baby because it is yet another item they can choke themselves with.<br />3) hard for baby to hold control: until baby is a bit older (3-6 months) and has better control of his/her hand, this pacifier is not easy for baby to hold and/or push back into the mouth. Other pacifiers have large handles or areas for small and uncontrolled hands to reach for and grab. Not this one.<br />4) CAUTION ABOUT SIZES: this is really important, and I only discovered this recently. There are two sizes (newborn 0-3 months) and (3+months). THe first size is much softer, the second size harder. It is important to change your baby to the larger size when they reach 3+ months because they start being able to bend the whole pacifier in the mouth and can even accidentally make the whole thing bend and fit in mouth! Super scary and dangerous. Though there are two small holes on either side of the pacifier that should allow baby to keep breathing if this were to happen, that gives me little comfort. The 3+ month size is much firmer and will prevent baby for bending and shoving the whole thing in mouth. So make sure you move to the second size!<br />* (theyhave also changed the way they package and label the sizes, to make everything more confusing! Before it was a newborn 0-3 month size, and then a 3/6month -18month size. Now the second size is simply labeled as 3+ months. Still the same pacifier, just new packaging to make sleep-deprived moms feel even more crazy....)
i purchased this soother three years ago when we had our first child. it was one of the few purchases as a newbie parent that i actually got right on the first try.     i love, love, love the music and nature noises on this soother. in my experience, others tend to have a tinny or canned electronic quality to their sound, but both the nature sounds and songs are realistic and quite pleasant. i also love the bubbling water, which makes a soothing gurgling noise, and the hypnotic swing of the monkey. the backlight of the waterfall shifts subtly, mimicking the movement of real water shimmering in the light. the lowest volume setting is perfect.    but enough about me. the proof is in the pudding, and my now three year old daughter still uses this soother every night to fall asleep. starting when she about 7 months old, i would stumble into her bedroom after hearing her cry out in the night, only to find her back on her tummy with the soother on, sleeping soundly. heaven!     there has been literally no deterioration of this product after multiple nightly uses, three years running. as for the brightness, i suppose that's a personal preference. my daughter never seemed bothered by the light, which to me seems no brighter than your average nightlight. maybe the color of the light makes it seem brighter; since its ambient glow is blue, it is inherently more noticeable?    it is true that the monkey on our soother does emit a small, plasticky creak when swinging. the volume of the creak is quiet enough that it doesn't present a problem. besides, as many parents will tell you, children--particularly infants--will often find comfort in repetitive noises that we may consider grating. the monkey's noise is rhythmic, quiet, and consistent (i.e. it makes the same exact noise for the same exact duration each time), so in my experience, it doesn't detract at all from the soothing qualities.    when we had our second daughter two months ago, i was foolishly trapped into a world of pink like i never was with my first girl, so i bought the pink fisher price dreamland soother. i really wish i'd just purchased a second rainforest one. the sounds on the dreamland are fake and too loud, and the projection feature is a weak stream of light emitting at too awkward an angle to position where baby can see. trust me: i got it right the first time. you should, too!
We love our Wubbies! I originally got the elephant and the giraffe as baby gifts when my son was first born. We have since added the cat, dragon, and owl to our collection and have them stationed around the house and in the diaper bag. My son likes all the animals, but the Owl is by far his favorite. He loves to look at Wubby's eyes and now that he's old enough to hold onto it, he carries it around everywhere. I feel like the Wubbanubs are a good way to start working on hand control and dexterity and my husband loves them because they are easier to catch than just the pacifier when they fall/get tossed. As for cleaning, we give our Wubbies a bath several times a week by putting the pacifier end in boiling water (we call it the Wubby watering hole). I've also washed all our Wubbies multiple times using a garment bag and they do really well (our giraffe popped a seam in the wash, but it was easy to sew back up). To rank all the Wubbanubs we have:<br />1.Owl: Our favorite Wubby. Before he could hold onto it, my son could hug it making it the easiest Wubby to carry around since I didn't have to hold it. The eyes are like magic, my son loves to look at the owl's eyes. Now that he's teething, he also likes to chew Wubby's feet and the edge of the pacifier. It has done great in the wash and will be a great little stuffed toy when we are done with the pacifier.<br />2.Giraffe: This was the first Wubbanub we got and I think it's great for little babies since it's light and thin. My son seems to like the contrasting colors and when he was just learning to grasp things, the giraffe was easiest because it has the two horns a thin neck and a tail to hang onto. It's also very cute and is our second favorite.<br />3. Dragon: The dragon has fun colors (red/blue/orange) and is chunky like the owl so it's easy for little ones to hang onto. The body is thick, but the wings are easy for little hands to grab. Not my son's favorite, but it's pretty cute.<br />4. Cat: Cute colors, and myson likes the kitties feet. It's nothing too exciting, we use it as the back-up most of the time.<br />5. Elephant: Also a chunkier Wubbanub. It hasn't been our favorite, but as my son gets older he's liking it more and more. When we first got it we rarely used it just because it was really big for a tiny baby. At three months old, my son is starting to pay more attention to the elephant's ears and can hang onto its body so we're using it more and more.

my husband and i looked into a lot of different monitors...both video and just audio. we really wanted to get a video monitor since we like the idea of being able to the check on our little one without possibly waking her up.....especially when we hear a funny noise. (so nice to not have to get out of bed to check on her.) also, we plan to get a second camera and put that in the play room once she is older so we can check on her while doing other things.<br /><br />most video monitors cost a lot, and if you want tons of bells and whistles then you will have to shell out a lot of cash, but this one seemed to be the best for the price(especially based on all of the positive reviews). below are the positives and negatives i have found after 6 months of use. (plus a few \\eh, it doesn't do much for me\\ things.)<br /><br />positives<br />over 6 months of use and no problems at all!<br />can clearly hear and see our child (screen size is great, good detail during the day and very good night vision)<br />was about to mount the camera on the wall near the crib and see the entire inside of the crib while also being able to see a lot of details of her face.<br />displays the room temperature<br />decent range (can work outside and still hear and see her)<br />the sound is very clear and i like the five led alerts for noise level.<br /><br />eh, it doesn't do much for me<br />can zoom in one level (with how much a child moves in a crib it's not that helpful)<br />has an intercom so you can talk to your child (just made mine mad because she couldn't see me...will be a more useful feature when i buy a second camera and mount it in the play area)<br />has lullabies....kinda annoying to me, kid might like them.<br /><br />negatives<br />the only negative i have (and it's not that negative) is that the battery doesn't last super long. if you are smart and plug it in when it is not in use then you shouldn't have a problem. it does last for several hours left on and even longer if you turn it off but don't plug it in. i suggest you leave it plugged in at night and just leave the screen off. (the screen stays on when plugged in and will turn off after about 4 or 5 minutes if it's not.)<br /><br />overall.....a great buy!!!turn it off but don't plug it in. i suggest you leave it plugged in at night and just leave the screen off. (the screen stays on when plugged in and will turn off after about 4 or 5 minutes if it's not.)<br /><br />overall.....a great buy!!!
My daughter refuses to eat more than an ounce or so every few hours, even when she was starving (been like that since she was born, she actually refused to eat the first 72 hours. Guess she never really caught onto the whole sucking thing) and would not accept any type of pacifier(like many parents we bought every pacifier on the market). That was until a friend told us they had a similar dilema and bought us a pack to try out. She absolutely loves them! They are perfect hold overs for until she really wants to eat.    These pacifiers are one piece and without the plastic guard. The advantage to this is that it reduces the chances of nasties lurking in the seams/cracks of where the plastic joins the nipple from improper washing or not sterilizing. Unless you are disassembling your childs two piece pacifier(plastic from nipple) and cleaning it, you're not cleaning it as well as your tell yourself.    Some  perhaps your child shouldn't be using them. These are NEWBORN PACIFIERS as stated on the package. If your child is not a NEWBORN then it's probably best to move onto other pacifiers more appropriately sized for your child. Everyone is different but I have a hard time believing a NEWBORN(as these are made for NEWBORNS) can swallow the entire pacifier. I've tried and had trouble myself.    Other complaints about the lack of 'bulbing' at the tip of the pacifier which makes it difficult for the newborn to hold in it's mouth is nothing more than laziness. Pay your child more attention. If your child is sucking her thumb(or mittens, sleeves, blankie, what have you) then she/he is  either hungry or wants comfort. If you're sticking a pacifier in a NEWBORNs mouth just so you don't have to listen to them cry, it's probably a good time to rethink your methods of raising a child. A pacifier is a great way to comfort or help increase her appetite(we used these to increase her appetite and get her in the habit of sucking so she would eat more) but should not be used simply as adistraction so you don't have to deal with them.     Lastly, people say these are ugly as sin. I agree, but your child doesn't care:) Just like all the decorations or excessive amount of money you can spend on newborn clothing, your child does not care.    If it works, it work. Every child is different. For our kid that had trouble grasping the 'sucking' motions for the first few months(whether it was breastfeeding or the Playtex slow flow latex wide nipples which are the absolute slowest nipples around!), these helped her become strong and healthy!
we tried three bouncers. the first one did not \\bounce\\ and the toy bar was full of barnyard animals that interested her for about 3 minutes. the second one we tried was the \\rainforest\\ one that everyone said was awesome. she absolutely hated it. she would scream every time we put her in the seat. finally, i saw this one on amazon and decided it was worth a shot. she loved it!<br /><br />pros:<br />* the material is soft and plush and seems very comfortable for baby. my baby loves playing with the monkey's ears that stick out.<br />* the light up bar has three butterflies with three animals--the middle has a pull down toy (looks like bananas) that makes one of three cute sounds when you (or the baby pulls it).<br />* there are two sound modes--one that runs the sounds to play over and over again, and the other activates when you pull the bananas in the middle.<br />* let's face it, baby musical toys can get annoying. this one does not. i love the tunes. they are catchy and have two volume levels so you can play them soft or a little louder. the music is great.<br />* when my baby was younger, she did not have the strength to pull the \\bananas\\ but loved the lights and sounds. now that she's about 6 months, she loves to pull down the bananas and start the music herself.<br />* the material holds up over time and is easy to clean if you spill something (or baby spits up, whatever).<br />* the price!!! for what it does, the price of this cannot be beat.<br /><br />cons:<br />* there are little \\rattles\\ that make up the monkey's feet that are sewn into the chair that are supposed to be there so the baby's feet can kick them and make them rattle. however, the chair itself is very shallow so if you have a bigger baby at all (ours is just about the 50% in height) she cannot kick the rattle part--her feet hang far past the rattle feature, thereby making it useless.<br />* one of my monkey ears was sewn incorrectly so the ear always looks funny and folds into the chair instead of sticking out. i really shouldn't fault the chair for this, but it's annoying.<br /><br />overall, i wish i had bought this chair first. the lights and sound keep your baby entertained, it's soft and durable, and a fantastic price. i really don't think you can get yourself a better chair for your little monkey.tead of sticking out. i really shouldn't fault the chair for this, but it's annoying.<br /><br />overall, i wish i had bought this chair first. the lights and sound keep your baby entertained, it's soft and durable, and a fantastic price. i really don't think you can get yourself a better chair for your little monkey.
I honestly can't imagine how there are any less than 5 star reviews though I suppose all babies are different. I picked this up when my girl was about 3 mo on a whim having previously refused to spend so much on a binkie for my son when he was little or my new baby. Wow was I irritated with myself for not giving these a go 3 years ago. My daughter was 5 weeks premature and about 5 pounds, so small but not excessively so and the first 3 months we struggled to find her a binkie that would work as she had the tiniest mouth (so tiny that even the binkies for real preemies didn't fit her tiny mouth, tiny mouths are genetic in our family to begin with) so we tried everything available and as soon as we popped a binkie bear in her mouth and she snuggled the bear into her tiny arms I knew we had found magic. Due to some really serious heath complications from my pregnancy that had me bedridden and in and out of the hospital for the first 9 months of her life, it was imperative we find something she could sooth herself with and this product was a godsend. I'm not sure if they work for children under 3 mo who can't even partially grasp at objects but by that time she was able to sort of grab the plush part enough to cuddle it and this kept the pacifier portion in her mouth most of the time, plus it's so large that it's very difficult to lose tho not impossible I promise. The only downside is that the plush portion isn't machine washable, you can hand soak and disinfect but considering they spend so much time in babies mouth they get pretty nasty looking and matted and stiff after a few months even if their technically &#34;clean&#34;. However I can't imagine a reasonable design workaround that would allow the binkie to be attached but still washable so I can't hold that against the manufacturer. I'm a little disappointed that our local slave labor big box store stopped carrying them because they were only costing me about $6.99 and every place else charges at least twice thatplus shipping. It's still worth it to keep my daughter happy because she's miserable without one of these babies close by. She pretty much snubs her nose at any pacifier without an attached teddy bear now which put us in a real pickle last weekend when she lost ALL three during one infamous Ikea trip where she's was in a particularly gravity obsessed mood in the linens and no one seems to sell them brick and mortar since I last stocked up. I'm telling you, short of duct tape and a visit by child protective services, these pacifiers will a happy baby make and a happy baby is a happy mama (much like my happiness dictates my husband's sleeping arrangements). Trust me, these are THE binkie to have. And darn their cute too.
I exclusively breastfeed my 6 week old and we had been having huge problems between latch and gas/colic, my baby was miserable and would cry constantly.  As a last ditch effort I decided to try pumping, but my little one refused to take the medela bottles we had. I found this set at Walmart in white and figured it was worth a try since my son takes the MAM paci. He took the bottle instantly and I've loved them since. Here is my breakdown of pros and cons<br />PROS: - the vented bottle does help with gas, its like I have a whole new baby and we are getting to enjoy the smiles that we love to see! Note: he still has gas but there is a marked change in how he handles it grunts vs. Crying and screaming<br />- the nipple shape is easy for him to use and doesn't seem to bother him switching from the bottle to me when I want him to nurse.<br />-the sterilization feature is awesome! I didn't want to buy one of those bulky sterilizers and I'm busy enough as it is with my family and baby, so 3 minutes in the microwave and done!<br />- super easy to clean! These things come completely apart in 5 larger pieces, it takes no time to clean and I know I didn't miss anything<br />- they are easy to re-assemble, just pop the silicon ring into the base, screw on the body (make sure the threads are right and its tight to prevent leaks) pop nipple into neck then screw onto top! I found these much more user friendly than other anti-colic bottles. Even my beloved Born Free that I used for my first son can't stand up to the MAM.<br />-did I mention they have helped the gas issue?  Because that's the most important part for me :)<br />-I like how much this set comes with for the low price, I should note the pacis are 2+ month so they may be a little big for newborns.<br /><br />CONS:<br />-they can leak, most of the time its user error,  note what I said early about watching the threads, I have done it a few times and accidentally dumped half the bottle on me and the baby, but once I figured out what I was doing wrong I've had no more leaks.  If you are super groggy at night, you may want to have some bottles already put together so you don't have to worry about it.<br />- I wouldn't heat liquid in them. My hubby has with no issues,  but I just don't trust it. Its easier for me to reheat the bottle that I pumped in and pour the liquid into these. Besides the wide bottom doesn't fit in some warmers.<br />-the numbers aren't the easiest to read especially if you care about anything less than 2 ounces.  For me, this hasn't been an issue to cause much concern.<br /><br />Overall I love the bottles, they are cute and more functional than I could hope! Amazon does seem to have the best price,  so I intend to purchase extras here
I first bought these when I again had to replace the 12 pacifiers that had gone missing. My daughter had grown accustom to the feel of the hospital brand pacifiers since she spent a couple of months there after birth. I came across these and bought them because they were super cute but was unsure if my daughter would like them. Previously I had bought pacifiers that looked like the ones the hospital provided but were not. The plastic used to make them were shiny and for whatever reason my daughter had no interest in them. I later discovered that the Gum Drop pacifiers were identical to the ones provided by hospitals. They have a vast variety of styles and colors like [[ASIN:B000ZEXKJE GumDrop Pacifier Full-Term Natural Scent Orange 5 Pack]] and [[ASIN:B007VSM3CM Gum Drop Preemie Pacifier Vanilla Scent (Green)]] for preemies. These wubbanubs were in fact made of the same material and perfect for my little one. I only wished I had found them sooner since my other two children are grown. I could have saved myself from trips to the crib in the middle of the night to give baby back her pacifier. These pacifiers are perfect for little hands to find and grab in the middle of the night. My daughter just puts her own pacifier back in her mouth. I have yet to lose these unlike the gazillion other pacifiers I have purchased over the years. They make a great toy for baby as well. While the pacifier is in her mouth she tends to play with the plush and tag. It is a somewhat meditative motion that helps to sooth her and/or occupy her in her carseat/stroller/crib. So not only is it a pacifier and toy but it helps build motor skills. There are a number of different colors, animals and even textures like this one [[ASIN:B0031W38YO Wubbanub Plush Pacifier Toy, Mango Monkey]]. The tabby kitten is my favorite.  I have noticed that it is slightly smaller than the other ones I've purchased but my daughter loves it just the same.  The pacifier itself is sewn very well to the plush, however, I usually cut the pacifier out after its seen some wear. Just as a caution. Once you stitch the the hole back you have another little toy for baby to play with unlike the plain pacifiers that you have to dump. They make great gifts and additions to a shower basket. I have bought many for my friends. When you think of the must haves in baby gear, I personally would add this to my list.<br /><br />Update: To wash or sterilize, I place a small plastic sandwich bag around the plush to prevent it from getting wet. I can then wash the pacifier with warm water and anti-bacterial soap or clean with a baby safe sterilizer.  Then I just take a sterile wipe or even a baby wipe to gently rub the plush doll.  It has worked well for me and keeps baby's gear germ free.
i knew exactly what i wanted when i was going to get baby monitor for my baby daughter. i searched both for a video and audio monitor and decided on the samsung sew-3037. as far as i am concerned, i don't mind spending a little bit more as long as i am getting what i paid for. with this in mind, i quickly decided not to go with an audio monitor. i think the option to monitor my child with both video and audio would worth the extra money i spend. then focusing my attention on the video monitors, i settled between on the samsung sew-3037 for several reasons.<br /><br />before making the purchase i looked at the features  of the monitor. the monitor offered a great range and an interference free connection. it also has some features that really tweeked my interest. i thought the two way talk feature was pretty useful and the fact that you can connect up to four cameras really got me thinking about the various potential uses of this system. (maybe not only as a baby monitor). lastly, it had the vox feature that i didn't know too much about but it got me interested. it said something about noise cancellation and i wondered how that would work. lastly, i was very excited about the ptz feature on the cameras.<br /><br />as for design, i believe samsung's monitor looks sleek and elegant. the black on white really makes the monitor look like a quality product. the overall design of the camera, the color, and shape of the monitor is sharp, and the four way directional button to control the camera is very convenient and easy to use.<br />why i decided to go with samsung: i purchased the sew-3037 because of three reasons.  as a company, i trust samsung. they know how to make electronic products. i love their tv and i love their phones. i figured, they'd do a great job on this as well. secondly, the overall image quality, the ptz feature, and the vox feature. lastly, the monitor being expandable to four camera system.<br /><br />after receiving the monitor: i love it. i tested it for a couple of days and i can't stop playing with it. the overall video and audio quality on the camera is very good. the range hasn't given us any problems and we have a pretty sizeable house. i don't believe it's available now, but i definitely plan to purchase more cameras. the vox is a great feature. it saves battery so you get a good couple of hours on the monitor. it also keeps things quietly and goes into sleepmode when my daughter isn't making any noise for a minute or two. then it comes alive again if she stirs. you can set the sensitivity and also turn it off all together.<br /><br />the feel of the cameras and the monitor is solid, not flimsy at all. the color and design is as i thought, very sleek. i love the look of the camera. i'm thinking i'm going to find other uses for it even after my daughter gets older. i think this was a great buy and definitely will recommend it to my friends.
i'm so glad that i got this caddy to use as our main car seat stroller for my son for the first few months of his life.  originally i was thinking of buying a &#34;travel system&#34; (consisting of a full-size stroller, plus a car seat).. after testing them out i decided to get the caddy instead, and have been totally happy with my purchase.  here's what's so great about it: - it's super lightweight and portable - very easy to fold up and store in the car, then open up and pop baby in and out (without waking him, etc.) when running around town running errands. - handling is very good and it's actually pretty versatile, more versatile than you might think given how lightweight/portable it is.  it's definitely not an all-terrain stroller (the wheels aren't large or robust enough), but we took it on some walks on mostly flat dirt trails (nothing too bumpy/crazy), and it held up just fine. - storage basket is pretty darn generous for such a lightweight stroller.  it's no uppababy vista or anything, but it's plenty large for a diaper bag or groceries.  it's pretty easy to access too.  you may also be considering the snap n go generic caddy stroller, especially because it's so much cheaper than the chicco.  i struggled with the same thing, and am so glad that in the end i bought the chicco caddy made specifically for chicco carseats.  the chicco carseat audibly snaps into the chicco caddy and is much more securely attached than it would be on the snap n go (where there is no &#34;click,&#34; and you are supposed to manually close a strap over the carseat every time you attach it).  otherwise, i found the two stroller caddies to be pretty similar, in terms of ride/handling, quality/materials, etc.  but the greater security/safety & convenience (not having to use the strap) of the chicco caddy were good enough reasons for me to spring for it.  if you have a chicco keyfit car seat, and you plan to do a lot of in & out of the car, then i would definitely recommend that you get a caddy ... and this is the best one available for chicco carseats.  the only time i wouldn't recommend that you get a caddy is if you are primarily going to be strolling from home, and/or you really need an all-terrain stroller.  in those cases, by all means get a full-size stroller and just get an adapter so it can carry your keyfit.  but for most people, i think this would be a totally worthwhile purchase just for the added portability & convenience.  ------------  update aug 2016:  we kept this stroller around and just finished using it for kid #2.  she was tiny, so is still in her infant car seat at 15 months (!), so we have gotten a crapload of use out of this thing!  and it is still in great shape, totally functional.  the foam surrounding the handlebar is not as squishy as it was when we first bought it 4.5 years ago, but otherwise it's working as well as the day we bought it.  this really was a great buy for us.
shopping for my daughter's baby was easy! having knowledge of what first time moms really need vs. what is just unnecessary noise/static/fiscal waste proved indispensable. this graco totbloc pack n play is a mom's helper and it is perfectly coloured.  the primary colours and close netting sides are a must for newborns up until ~ 15 months (give or take; depending on how tall your child gets).  it provides a safe environment for your child while you are (within eye-sight) doing those things that need to be done.  of course, your child must never be left unsupervised, but this play yard functions as a temporary sanctuary. it is roomy and comes with everything that you need in a playpen: colour, sturdy see through sides, playpen floor padding, and a carry bag to keep it clean and portable!<br />while it is a very sturdy play yard, it is portable. while it is portable, it is somewhat heavy; this is because it is sturdy and reasonably substantial.  this is not the sort of play yard that is light weight for extremely short/temporary use; and that is why i chose it for my daughter's baby.  i found playpens indispensable as a first time mom and as a second time around mom as well!  as your baby grows, this graco totbloc play yard will be able to house favorite toys, etc. to keep baby occupied while you do necessary things (always within eye-sight/supervision; never leaving your child unattended!): such as work @ home (or in your office [if you are fortunate enough to work in that sort of company]); doing household necessities; sitting outside relaxing with a good book while baby takes a nap outside with you; etc.<br />i looked at quite a few playpens before picking this one.  the price point was excellent.  the colour was perfect because it will positively stimulate babies of various stages.  it was the perfect size (not too small, not too rectangular).  although a bit heavy, this playpen is portable.  it came with everything that is needed for a playpen (many do not come with a floor cover pad, etc.).  it has a carrying case/bag for better storage and portability.  the graco totbloc pack 'n play with carry bag offers almost everything needed in a playpen.<br />the only thing is that the bars on the top of this play yard are covered but not padded.  if there were padding on the bars, this playpen would be absolutely flawless; and deserving of 5 stars.<br />graco totbloc pack 'n play is a great product, at a great price from amazon.com!ith a floor cover pad, etc.).  it has a carrying case/bag for better storage and portability.  the graco totbloc pack 'n play with carry bag offers almost everything needed in a playpen.<br />the only thing is that the bars on the top of this play yard are covered but not padded.  if there were padding on the bars, this playpen would be absolutely flawless; and deserving of 5 stars.<br />graco totbloc pack 'n play is a great product, at a great price from amazon.com!
i am pretty thrilled with this bike trailer. i use it more as a jogger, but my man and i have both taken our 20-month-old around in it as a trailer, and we all love it.<br /><br />best points:<br /><br />鈥?assembly and breaking down for storage is a snap. button-release tires and simple-yet-sophisticated folding make it quick to deal with. (keep in mind, though, that it's designed around utility, so it's going to take a little longer than your average street stroller. the first time, as with most new gadgets, takes a bit longer, too.)<br /><br />鈥?the cabin is very spacious, and will handily accommodate our child's long torso as he grows.<br /><br />鈥?storage 'trunk' behind the seating and pockets in the cabin hold plenty. there's lots of foot room, so i often put things at my son's feet, too.<br /><br />鈥?the rigid floor is excellent. it supports his feet and keeps his legs more comfortable than the soft-floored ones can.<br /><br />鈥?the feature that i love most isn't mentioned in the manual at all, i assume for legal reasons. there are leg holes under the handle that render it into a shopping-cart-style seat, so when we're out for a long time, and my son has had enough of looking forward on his own, he can join me as i push it along. this feature alone is priceless. it has saved the day countless times already in the few months we've had it. there is no harness, so i am very careful, and i would never take my hands off it when he's there, but it is well designed. it seems insubstantial, but holds him very well. (it helps to have some cargo in the front, for balance.)<br /><br />鈥?it is undeniably handsome. i probably wouldn't have chosen the bright yellow if there had been more options, but it is cheerful and easy to look at. it is also easy to see, which makes it safer.<br /><br />鈥?it is vented. most of the time, we keep the bug screen and window open and stowed, so ventilation isn't much of an issue, but in rain or cooler weather, the vent underthe handle is terrific. to keep airflow going, i zip the window down on both sides, but tuck the bottom inch or two up next to the screen.<br /><br />cons:<br /><br />鈥?soft seat means with two riders, they'll squish toward the middle. it's easy to fix by adding something rigid underneath. when his buddy comes along, that's what we do, and it works perfectly.<br /><br />鈥?the back of a bike helmet pushes the child's head forward, which must be uncomfortable. i got no complaint from my little guy, but i'm thinking of a way to fix it, because it bugs me.<br /><br />鈥?while i wouldn't call it heavy, i've seen other bike trailers out there that are tiny and look featherlight. anyone who spends much time on a bike knows how much weight matters. it's easy enough to haul around, but its features and size mean that it's no fun coming across  a stop sign when you're starting up a hill with two kids in the trailer.<br /><br />all in all, this is a superb piece of equipment.
LOVE these pacifiers!  We bought small packs of three different types of pacifiers to see what our baby would prefer.  We bought Dr Brown's Prevent, Nuk, and Avent.  Our baby will LOVES the Dr Brown pacifiers.  She'll put up with the Avent ones, but they pop out of her mouth so easily it's hardly worth it.  The Nuk ones get spit out almost instantly, they're too hard to keep in her mouth.  These ones have a fantastic shape that is very well designed.  I love that it doesn't give her gas because she's not sucking any air.  These are just so perfectly designed and we've already bought more for her.  I think it's good advice to try different pacifiers for your baby because all babies are different, but I will say that these ones definitely stay in their mouths better no matter who your baby is - so I won't tell you not to try different pacifiers at first, but definitely include these when you're trying a few out!  They'll probably become a quick favorite for you and baby.<br /><br />Originally we purchased the Dr Browns Prevent pacifiers from another Amazon listing where Colors may vary and there are no handles on the pacifier.  We ended up with blue and red, which I didn't love for our little girl.  It's silly and not important, but I didn't love having her suck on a blue or red pacifier when she was always dressed in pink or purple.  These pacifiers are much preferred!  Though they're the same shape for sucking, there are a few differences.  The silly difference (but it matters to me!) of the color is the obvious difference.  Another key difference is these ones also have the handles on them and the others don't.  I have found that I much prefer the handles for multiple reasons.  One, they are easy to hold if I'm burping her and just want to have the pacifier handy for when she's done and ready for it.  Two, if I drop the pacifier, the extra weight from the handle makes it land on the back almost every time so the nipple doesn't get dirty.  Three, if you're attaching a pacifier clip, it can attach to the handle instead of the opening on the part of the pacifier that touches the baby's face.  Our pacifier clip was always rubbing against our baby's face when using the other ones and I didn't like that since it left a red mark on her cheek.<br />Another difference is that these pacifiers actually come with a clip-on nipple cover.  I LOVE this accessory because if I'm running to a neighbor's house for a short visit and I don't need to tote a whole diaper bag, but I do want to bring a pacifier - I easily can with the clip cover.  It works so great to just clip the cover on so I can throw the pacifier in my pocket without it getting all nasty.  Or it's nice for putting in the diaper bag without getting gross as well.<br /><br />The price is about the same (within a dollar) of the other colors may vary listing, so these ones are the clear winner between the two listings.  If you want a great pacifier for your little girl, these are PERFECT!
I fought the idea of a pacifier for my second son, but he was colicky and we resorted to any method possible to stop the screaming. He became attached to the Soothie brand pacifier we were given at the hospital. When he was around 2 months, we began the battle of him losing his pacifier in the night and I was constantly waking up to put it back in his mouth. I had been skeptical about trying a Wubbanub because I was afraid he would form an attachment to it since it's a toy and a Soothie in one and that it would be hard to break him of it. In a state of sleep deprivation, I picked this one up and am so glad I did!<br /><br />When he was still small, I swaddled this up with him and night so that he didn't lose it. Did it make him sleep through the night? No. But at least I wasn't constantly retrieving a pacifier. As he got older, he learned to hold it himself and guide it back in his mouth. The longhorn attached made it easier for his immature eye-hand coordination than if it was just the pacifier. Now that he's 8 months old, he chews on the horns, sucks on the tag, and chews on the pacifier. I don't have bumper pads in his crib, so other pacifiers fall through the rail. This Wubbanub stays in the crib much better than those do.<br /><br />I've read reviews that say it's cheaply made or not easily washable and I do not agree. About once a week I round up all the pacifiers and boil them. I just hold the nipple of this into the boiling water to keep the longhorn dry. Rather than throwing it in the washing machine with clothes when the longhorn gets dirty (and it does a lot because it goes everywhere with us), I just hand wash it with some Dreft and let it air dry. This keep it from getting fuzzy, as other reviewers have mentioned.<br /><br />I had actually gotten on here to order a second one because we like it so much and I'm afraid we'll lose the one we have. My fear came true that this has become his lovey, but I plan to just cut the pacifier off when the time comesto wean off of it. I still wish he didn't use a pacifier, but I'm so happy that we found something he likes and is capable of using all on his own!<br /><br />UPDATED JULY 2013<br /><br />I still fully stand behind this product, but wanted to update that we did have our first big issue with this Wubbanub. At 10 months, my son is a terror when it comes to teething. He bites and chews very hard on anything available, including this pacifier. On the one he's been using for 6 months, he was finally able to rip the pacifier part off of the longhorn by chomping down on the pacifier and pulling on the plush part over and over for weeks. It came off in one piece and wasn't a choking hazard, but it's thoroughly confused my son! I think part of the problem is that these are made with Soothies for ages 0-6 months, which has thinner material in the pacifier. If I had a way to attach a 6+ month paci to this, it would probably fare much better. Still a great product, but keep an eye out for your little chompers and make sure that the material is still holding firm.
our son is five months old and already weighs 23 lbs. needless to say, even though he technically hadn't outgrown his infant carrier, he was miserable in it and it was way too heavy for me to carry around anyways. he wouldn't stay in it to use in the stroller so it was useless. i had to drive from phoenix to tucson (around two hours) and couldn't stand to hear him cry the whole way so i went to the store and bought an evenflo convertible that could recline. it was better than the infant seat in that he did fall asleep during the drive but once he woke up, he cried. so i continued to search for something that would make him happy. i was looking for a seat that reclined as much as possible. i stumbled upon the maxi-cosi priori when i googled which car seats were best for big babies. the evenflo i purchased was around $250 at babies r us and was a good seat but the priori is literally heavenly and i found it at albeebaby.com for $90!<br /><br />i drove around running errands today and he couldn't help but fall asleep!! at the end of the day when he was hungry and tired he was a tiny bit fussy for a couple minutes on the drive home and then presto--asleep again! my husband and i went out to dinner tonight and the whole drive we just kept smiling at each other and thanking god for this miraculous seat because he was either happy or sleeping the whole time. thank you maxi-cosi!!<br /><br />when i first took it out of the box i was disappointed because it didn't look like it reclined very much but there is a plastic piece on the bottom that flips to the other side in rear facing position to make it recline even more! it was about the same difficulty as the evenflo to install using the latch system. it is a little more difficult to make it a tight fit because it doesn't have the automatic tightening in the latches like the evenflo did. you have to tighten it manually which is kind of hard but it helps to adjust it to as close as you can before latching it so that it just needs to be a little tighter. someone mentioned that the buckle is too tight around the legs, which i could see, but my guy has some honking thighs and he fits just fine. i find it easier to loosen the straps when i take him out and then tighten it again once he's in so that you have plenty of room to adjust without risking pinches. it is easy to release the straps and then tighten them again, even in the rear-facing position. the buckle has a cloth cover to protect the skin from hot materials which is nice down here in phx and i also noticed that the material, although black, never felt too warm (although it is march so we'll see how it does in july). one big bummer is that you have to rethread the straps to adjust the height but you don't have to do that more than a couple times throughout its life so it's worth it for such an awesome seat!<br /><br />just a side note: we ordered it in corniche thinking it was grey but it is actually black with black mesh on the sides. this is actually the color we wanted but didn't think it was worth spending more for the \\phantom\\ color. bonus!
we bought this pre-baby being born, and got the foam infant inserts to go with it. the day i had to bring my newborn home, i had no idea what i was doing with the buckles.  we actually put the seatbelt on the baby completely wrong, gave up and i held the baby in the seat on our short ride home! (not recommended).  i am not saying this to discourage you to buy this seat, rather i think you should educate yourself on how to put an infant into a car seat well in advance of the day you decide to take the baby home from the hospital!!!  since then, obviously we figured it out. and now we love this carseat.<br /><br />i own both the boulevard cs 70 and the marathon versions of the britax seats.  the boulevard is considerably more &#34;luxe&#34; than the marathon. i like that the seatbelt clicks. at first, i hated it because i felt like it was way too constricting when it squeezed against my baby. but now i feel like i need that comfort of the click to know the seat belt is on properly.  the marathon that i have does not have the click feature, and i never feel like it's on tight enough.<br /><br />we decided to not go with the infant carrier seat, and i am very happy with my decision to not get one (despite a lot of protests from my friends).  a few words of advice for those of you choosing to use only one convertible car seat from birth until they outgrow the seat...<br /><br />1.) newborns need a full recline! otherwise their heads roll forward and can constrict breathing.  we had to get towels and prop the seat up so that the seat would fully recline properly in our car<br /><br />2.) when the seat is rear facing, and in newborn recline mode, it may not fit in your car right. especially if you are tall people that require the driver seat and passenger seats pushed all of the way back.  my husband is 6'4&#34;.  this is a problem for us, because the seat couldn't recline completely and thus, the baby's neck was constricted.  we actually bought a new car all because of this!!! not exactly the most economical approach, but we wanted a new car anyhow.<br /><br />3.) the cushions are essential to get with your convertible car seat so that you can properly get a ball of a newborn baby to fit into the seat right.<br /><br />4.) i highly recommend getting one of those inserts that wraps around the baby's head so that the head doesn't fall from side to side.  that was a huge problem for me at first because of the lack of neck and head control in those first months.<br /><br />5.) if you are in a bumpy ride (think a jeep wrangler, or a sporty subaru impreza with stiff shocks), then don't get a seat like this for a newborn. their head is going to bounce all over the place in the car seat.<br /><br />6.) it takes some practice to maneuver the newborn into the car seat because of the lack of head control.  you have to sort of hold the baby horizontal, and slide them into the car seat sideways. it's annoying but possible.<br /><br />overall, it's possible to do this from birth on, but there are definitely considerations that need to be made when making that choice!
i recently purchased this gate and installed it in just a couple of minutes.  i don't have kids.  i have a dog and a bird.  dog wanted to go in bird's room and tear up newspaper and scavange around, dragging stuff around the house making a mess.  that had to stop.  so i got this gate to put in the doorway of the bird's room.  the very cool thing, to me anyway (easily entertained), was that i could install it in the door frame and it didn't interrupt use of the door so i could still close his door at night and keep it open during the day, leaving the baby gate there to block the dog from entering.<br /><br />the gate is powder-coated metal and is very sturdy and well made.  it feels secure and strong where i put it.  the gate opens pretty easily.  at first i had to get the feeling of it (push in button and lift a little bit to get it to clear the locked area) and it was a cinch after that.<br /><br />i love that you can push it all the way open (in either direction) and have it stay open when you want it that way.  or, just open it enough to go through it and let it fall closed.  since it can open out into either direction, that makes it more versatile because you can install it with the latch on either side, thereby allowing you to have it open to the left or right.<br /><br />i like it so much that i just ordered another one for my stairwell.  i don't want the dog going upstairs into my office when i'm not there and i've just been blocking the entrance at the top of the stairs with a sheet of styrofoam at night.  looks tacky.  i can put this down near the foot of the stairs and it will look much better, plus i can just leave it swung open during the day.<br /><br />i cannot think of anything i do not like about this gate.  the learning curve in getting it up right was very small.  i also like that you don't have to put screws or nails in the walls if you don't want.  the tension-mount works very well.  it also comes with 2 expansion panels.  i didn't use those with my first one, but will be using them for my stairwell.<br /><br />this is noteworthy - the gate has all straight lines, unlike the main picture they have here on the website currently.  the one with the curved outer bars is not the one that i received.  mine does say model #4910, just like in the description.  but i felt it was noteworthy to advise that this model has all straight bars.  see the variety of pictures they provided and some of them do reflect that.  ***see pictures i have loaded here showing one gate without extensions and the other using both extensions.***for my stairwell.    this is noteworthy - the gate has all straight lines, unlike the main picture they have here on the website currently.  the one with the curved outer bars is not the one that i received.  mine does say model #4910, just like in the description.  but i felt it was noteworthy to advise that this model has all straight bars.  see the variety of pictures they provided and some of them do reflect that.  ***see pictures i have loaded here showing one gate without extensions and the other using both extensions.***
greatest stroller in the world.  if  you can only have one all purpose stroller this is the one.  we bought ours late 2007 and started using it with our first child in feb 2008. we are now on our 3rd child and the stroller is still going strong!  nothing wrong with it.  we are hard on this little stroller too.  it goes to the beach and out on the sand.  all summer it's rolling around bush gardens and other local theme parks day in and day out.  we have taken it down nature trails. you can spin it around backwards and tackle big curbs and even go up stairs.  you decend stairs forward by popping the front wheel up off the ground and rolling just the back wheels down the stairs like you would with a hand truck.<br />back in 2007 /2008 babies r us and other major retailers did not carry this brand or model.  i shopped for weeks testing each stroller and scrutinizing ever detail.  i would pretend to be my wife running to her car in am emergency, scooping the baby up in one arm and flinging the stroller into the trunk of the car and see how the stroller performed (the store employees thought i was crazy ). every stroller failed miserably until i found the city-mini and i fell instantly in love.  this stroller is the wisest purchase that i ever made in my entire life.  i am a raving fan.<br />these days when i'm out & about and i see a young couple with their first little baby (usually overdressed baby and over stressed parents) in a city mini i always say hi and congratulate them on their stroller.  i encourage them that what ever life and their new little bundle of joy happen to throw at them,  they & the city mini can handle.  i know smart parents when i see them because they're pushing a city mini.  i feel like we are in a special little club because we know the secret of what makes an awesome stroller.  light weight,  one hand maneuverability,  stupid easy fold up,  impeccable durability,  versatility,  great colors,  good looks,  etc.<br />all you parents to be make the smart choice from the beginning.  all you poor souls that didn't realize how important this decision was the first time around go ahead and make up for it now by choosing the unstoppable city mini.  this will be the last strollers you ever need unless you don't space your babies at least 2.5 years apart and then you will need the double city mini. i wish i could post a pick of my almost 8 year old city mini but my 8 month old daughter is riding in it at busch gardens tampa right now and i'm home writing this review.  good luck in your search.  god bless your family.the smart choice from the beginning.  all you poor souls that didn't realize how important this decision was the first time around go ahead and make up for it now by choosing the unstoppable city mini.  this will be the last strollers you ever need unless you don't space your babies at least 2.5 years apart and then you will need the double city mini. i wish i could post a pick of my almost 8 year old city mini but my 8 month old daughter is riding in it at busch gardens tampa right now and i'm home writing this review.  good luck in your search.  god bless your family.
i previously had a non-digital monitor and it was driving me crazy because there was always static coming through it and i was always trying to move it to a different location to decrease the static.  i lost a lot of hours of sleep to that thing.<br /><br />so i was looking for something digital and this is just perfect.  this monitor has several things i love:<br /><br />1. there is never any static whatsoever.  all you hear is the noises that are actually happening.<br /><br />2. it isn't set too sensitive, like most monitors are.  in fact there is a noise gate, so if the room is below a certain threshold, no noise comes through.  you don't hear breathing and eyes blinking, but you do hear any cry perfectly and even any thump.  we turn on very quiet music for my older child to listen to and typically we do not hear it at all through the monitor.  that's a feature, not a bug.  anyone who thinks this is not sensitive enough must be a first parent and wants to torture themselves with every little noise.  but it does hear any little cry from across the room, even ones that are not very intense.  i would say the sensitivity is perfect.<br /><br />3. it is sooooooo convenient to have two parent units.  one stays permanently next to my bed and the other is out in the livingroom.  you can turn the volume up or down as makes sense.  also there's a visual indicator of how loud the noises are.  works very nicely---in fact it is more sensitive than the audio, so you can see noises that you can't (don't want to) hear.<br /><br />4. these units also feature a vibrate warning if a noise at a certain level occurs.  my wife loved it but i am a light sleeper and found that feature too jarring, so we don't use it.<br /><br />5. the parent units warn you if they don't have a signal (e.g., if the baby unit got unplugged or something).<br /><br />i hear people complain about the battery life in these.  i can't comment because i don't use the batteries at all.  who does?  you just leave it plugged in in the relevant location and you always know what's going on.  there may be varying opinions on the right way to use these, but i can detect no reason to use a battery at all.  if you are carrying it around with you to get the mail or something, you might be a little too paranoid.<br /><br />these monitors have been a life saver.  they perfectly address all my concerns about monitors, sound great when they need to, and don't bother me the rest of the time.  i would definitely buy them again and recommend them to others.  they have helped me sleep soundly and also confidently.  that sleep is completely golden for the sleep-deprived parent.going on.  there may be varying opinions on the right way to use these, but i can detect no reason to use a battery at all.  if you are carrying it around with you to get the mail or something, you might be a little too paranoid.  these monitors have been a life saver.  they perfectly address all my concerns about monitors, sound great when they need to, and don't bother me the rest of the time.  i would definitely buy them again and recommend them to others.  they have helped me sleep soundly and also confidently.  that sleep is completely golden for the sleep-deprived parent.
this is one of those products that change the way you live. we got this when our baby was 3.5 months old and she took to it immediately. she is now almost 7 months old. it is comfortable for both baby and her caregiver, whomever it may be at the time. my mil, husband, babysitter, and i are all different heights (153 cm to 172 cm) and different sizes (50 kg to 83 kg) and this carrier can adjust to fit us all comfortably. there are many things i love about this carrier.<br /><br />pros:<br />- the biggest pro for us is the mesh cooling vent. the daily temperature here averages 28掳c to 35掳c with tropical humidity. while you're never going to be completely cool while carrying baby, the mesh makes it much more comfortable to do so.<br />- did i mention how comfortable it is to use? the wide waist belt provides loads of support and the shoulder straps are thick & padded. i like that you can wear the waist strap higher (on the waist) or lower (resting on the hips) to adjust for baby's height. i love having my baby within kissing distance!<br />- comfortable for baby! she's snug as a bug in a rug and regularly falls asleep while still in the carrier. the inward-facing design doesn't seem to bother her as she can still see out the sides (outward-facing carriers are not good for baby's development). in fact, she seems to prefer being high up in the carrier as she has a better view rather than being in her stroller.<br />- the sleeping hood is generously cut and is large enough to accommodate even a tall toddler. the way the hood is designed means that there are no strings or straps that can cut into baby's face. the straps to fasten the hood are attached to it and it all rolls neatly into provided front pocket. there are no dangling strings or buckles to get in the way. we've used the hood to help her sleep, keep the sun off her face and to keep the rain off her head.<br />- the front pocket is not very large, especially with the hood already tucked into it. however there is enough space to tuck some keys, cash and a phone if all you're doing is going for a walk or a quick run to the store.<br />- easier and more convenient than a stroller. we no longer take our graco stroller on outings now. having to take a stroller was so cumbersome and unwieldy, especially in crowds. the stroller also took up all the space in the trunk. now we just put baby in her carrier, grab the ju ju be bff and we're ready to go.<br /><br />cons:<br />- the care instructions state that it is best to avoid washing the carrier and to spot clean only. this has something to do with the organic dye used on the fabric and is supposed to help keep the carrier looking new. this is not a huge issue for me but i can imagine it being a big deal for some others. i highly recommend buying the drool pads and using them with the carrier from the very beginning to avoid getting any stains on it.<br />- no way to attach anything to the carrier. i would have liked to have a d-ring or two on the carrier so that a toy / pacifier can be attached to it and within reach the moment it is needed. imo this is something small that would be a great improvement to the utility of the carrier.<br /><br />overall, a great product and well worth the money spent!
My daughter had grown accustom to the feel of the hospital brand pacifiers since she spent a couple of months there after birth.  I frantically purchased several look-a-likes when we came home.  Even at the her tender age of just a few months old, she was not to be fooled by these silly knock-offs.  I had a diva on my hands and she wanted nothing less than the real thing.  I finally discovered that the Gum Drop pacifiers were identical to the ones provided by hospitals. They have a vast variety of styles and colors like [[ASIN:B000ZEXKJE GumDrop Pacifier Full-Term Natural Scent Orange 5 Pack]] and [[ASIN:B007VSM3CM Gum Drop Preemie Pacifier Vanilla Scent (Green)]] for preemies. Finally we were saved!<br /><br />During my search for the holy grail of pacifiers, I came across these wubanubs and bought them mostly because they were super cute.  And since I was starting a collection of pacifiers, I figured it wouldn't hurt to try.  Love, love, love these.  And my daughter does as well.<br /><br />First let me begin by saying that the pacifier, on these precious dolls, are practically identical to the make and material of the hospital variety and perfect for my little one.  They are perfect for little hands to find and grab in the middle of the night.  My daughter just puts her own pacifier back in her mouth.  I only wished I had found them sooner since my other two children are grown.  I could have saved myself from trips to the crib in the middle of the night to give baby back her pacifier.<br /><br />Although, they are a little pricier than a traditional pacifier...you save money by not having to purchase another two pack because you don't know where the gazillion others you purchased went.  I have yet to lose even one of these.  They also make a great toy for baby as well. While the pacifier is in her mouth she tends to play with the plush and tag. It appears to be a somewhat  meditative motion that helps to sooth her and/or occupy her in her carseat/stroller/crib.  So not only is it a pacifier and toy but it helps build motor skills and actually pacify.<br />There are a number of different colors, animals and even textures like this one [[ASIN:B0031W38YO Wubbanub Plush Pacifier Toy, Mango Monkey]]. The [[ASIN:B0028H3ACS WubbaNub Tabby Kitten]] is my favorite.  I have noticed that this one along with the Tabby cat is slightly smaller than the other ones I've purchased but my daughter loves it just the same.  The pacifier itself is sewn very well to the plush; however, I have cut the pacifier out of just one after its seen some wear.  ( Just as a caution.)  Once you stitch the hole back you have another little toy for baby to play with, unlike the plain pacifiers that you have to dump. They make great gifts and additions to a shower basket.  I have bought many for my friends. When you think of the must haves in baby gear, I personally would add this to my list.<br /><br />Update: To wash or sterilize, I place a small plastic sandwich bag around the plush to prevent it from getting wet. I can then wash the pacifier with warm water and anti-bacterial soap or clean with a baby safe sterilizer.  Then I just take a sterile wipe or even a baby wipe to gently rub the plush doll.  It has worked well for me and keeps baby's gear germ free.
i wanted to post a helpful review, as when considering this product i was so confused. hopefully i can provide a little clarity here.<br /><br />this high chair is a new model, there was an older version also. what comes in the box is essentially everything except the seat pad and harness. amazon pairs the chair with a seat pad set that i believe was meant for the older version of this chair. there is a little white buckle on the end of the \\crotch strap\\ that will need to be removed, and having done that it all fits together fine. i could not find any other seat pad set.<br />and you do want the set. if this seat is for a baby then you will want to use the small one. i saw mentioned in another review that someone's baby couldn't reach the tray; that is because they were not using the included comfort seat, which is essentially a booster seat for the chair. this comfort seat will only work with the small seat pad. the larger seat pad is for toddlers and older children. you will receive both plus the harness if you order this item: http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/b003oyxvku/ref=mw_dp_sim_ss1?pi=sy125<br /><br />as for my review of the chair itself, i love it! i am not convinced that some other reviews online are not fake negatives by competitors.<br />some have said the chair is heavy and difficult to move. really? i can slide it towards me with one foot. i imagine if you have carpet that's harder but the chair has to have some weight to it simply because of the design. it has to be sturdy.<br />others have said the straps are hard to clean and good gets stuck in the buckles. not so if you're using the harness correctly. the shoulder pads should be low so that they cover the straps and any buckles. the whole seat pad is easy to wipe off.<br /><br />i thought the price was a little high but the chair is quality. it looks like a theme park ride turned bar stool, and i am happy to pay the price if it means i don't have to have another piece of tan or hot pink plastic baby stuff in my life!<br />chances are that most people considering this chair are mainly interested in the aesthetics, and it truly is worth it. is it the best high chair in the world? probably not. is it the best looking? heck yeah!<br /><br />my only negative comments are of course the lack of clarity regarding seat pad options, and the instructions. the instruction book has a wonderful design but the instructions appear to actually go backwards, and the english is terrible. as my husband put it, it reads like \\chinese translated into german translated into swedish and then into english\\ it's really not that bad, but i did struggle with assembly.<br /><br />but it's all together now and my daughter loves it! and that's really the most important thing.stuff in my life!<br />chances are that most people considering this chair are mainly interested in the aesthetics, and it truly is worth it. is it the best high chair in the world? probably not. is it the best looking? heck yeah!<br /><br />my only negative comments are of course the lack of clarity regarding seat pad options, and the instructions. the instruction book has a wonderful design but the instructions appear to actually go backwards, and the english is terrible. as my husband put it, it reads like \\chinese translated into german translated into swedish and then into english\\ it's really not that bad, but i did struggle with assembly.<br /><br />but it's all together now and my daughter loves it! and that's really the most important thing.
My husband and I were given two orange newborn GumDrop pacifiers in the hospital and found that our daughter took to them quickly as she needed the additional suckling time and I couldn't be her permanent pacifier.  Before we found that our daughter prefers the GumDrop, we tried the following pacifiers (because we received a ton at my baby showers):   1) Philips Avent Soothie Pacifier - look similar to GumDrop, but doesn't have the nook cutout around the nose  2) NUK latex pacifier and the Nuk silicone - have the angled tip upwards  3) various MAM pacifiers - shorter oval sized stem and silicone  4) Dr. Brown's orthodontic pacifier - angled tip upwards    Our daughter preferred silicone to latex and wasn't picky at first, but once she hit 6 months, she wouldn't take any of the others than her GumDrop!  We don't give out 5 stars easily unless we really love something, but these GumDrop pacifiers are the best.  One thing to note - I wasn't sure what the difference was between the newborn vs. full-term GumDrop pacifier - newborn was what we received in the hospital on the package but it said full-term on the ones we ordered here on Amazon.  From what we can tell, we believe the only difference is the thickness/consistency of the silicone.  The newborn ones appear to be a little thinner/softer type of silicone and the full-term ones are a little thicker/sturdier perhaps since they chew harder especially now that there are teeth!  There is no difference in the length of the stem or the overall shape of the pacifier.  We purchased the natural scent as we thought that was safest and we just make sure to wash them often so they don't get the plastic type of smell pacifiers sometimes carry.  But next time we may try to order the vanilla scent just to see what the difference may be.    Pros:   - Love the nose cut-out because they can breathe easily without interference and it is made to conform to their face comfortable - not like the Soothie that takes up their whole face!- Hole for stem is easy for her to put her finger through when she wants to chew on something with some substance  - Medical-grade silicon -> dishwasher safe  - One piece of silicone is easy to clean and doesn't collect in hard-to-reach crevices  - Soft and pliable -> no nipple confusion when breastfeeding  - Firm enough that your little one can chew away but lightweight  - Hole that you can loop a pacifier strap through it to attach to their clothes  - Available in four colors: pink, purple, orange and blue    Cons: NONE!*  *One we received from the hospital recently cracked (after 7.5 months of use) as she liked to chew on all sides of them now that she can grab them herself and she was bending them backwards (against the way they are made to fit smoothly against their face).  I tried giving her one of the others we had until I could order some GumDrops and she put them in her mouth, immediately pulled them out and laid them on the ground all in a matter of two seconds.  That's why I think the full-term are helpful because it's a sturdier silicone likely better equipped for older babies/toddlers.    Just recently we saw [[ASIN:B004IOHN8Q The First Years 2 Pack GumDrop Infant Pacifier, Pink/Purple]] are now sold at Target and they have the same shape and appear to be almost identical to these but these also are offered in one more color, green.  I did buy some just to see if they were different and I noticed the difference in the thickness of the silicone in these much clearer than the ones on Amazon.  The First Years 0-3 months version is softer/thinner/more pliable than the 3+ months version which is a thicker/sturdier silicone.  The best price is still on Amazon, but still a good back up if you're ever in a bind.
I'm really glad I found these, because my two week old newborn has been in love with them ever since he got his first one in the hospital.<br /><br />I really do not understand the complaints about them not being orthopedic considering they're designed for 0-3 months and clearly state so. Where are these newborns sprouting teeth at 3 months old? The youngest baby I've ever seen with a tooth has been 5 months old. Generally bottle fed babies get them around 6 months, but breast fed babies can go as long as a year or more without them. So it seems kind of silly to be worrying about teeth at this stage. The style purpose is to replace fingers so breaking the sucking habit is a lot easier later down the road.<br /><br />I also will state the same thing here that I did on my Binky review about it staying in the babies mouth. It is meant to simulate a nipple, so you do have to ensure the baby has latched on to it securely before letting go. Otherwise yes, it's not going to stay in their mouth. You don't need a holder... As a mom that has breast fed two babies I assure you they are pros at maintaining a Hoover like suction that is near impossible to break and keeps what they want in their mouth there. If it falls out, the baby either doesn't want it or may have accidentally knocked it out/broken the suction with their hands. The latter can happen with ANY pacifier, and TBH this is one of the less likely models for them to do that to thanks to the lack of a handle.<br /><br />Furthermore, there's no air vents on a breast but somehow baby manages to breath. Could that be the reason they have those upturned pug like noses that give space for air while latched on to the breast? For the record, a doctor pointed this factor out to me in the hospital when a nurse changed our position for feeding reasoning that the baby could not breath in a more natural position. Doc said that was nonsense and that's why babies have the noses they do.<br /><br />Moving on... The things I really appreciate about this one compared to other nipple like designs like Binky:<br /><br />- The entire pacifier is silicone so if the baby falls asleep on it or it gets under them it doesn't cause them discomfort<br />- They're ridiculously cheap. Always a good thing when it comes to pacifiers. You will lose them by the truck load no matter their design.<br />- As stated earlier, the lack of a handle makes it less likely baby will accidentally knock it out of their mouth.<br />- As someone else pointed out, the hollow tip can have a finger stuck in it to encourage better latching.<br />- They're so freaking cute in the baby's mouth, LOL.<br /><br />One thing I don't like:<br /><br />- The weird silicone piece sticking out of it. Seems the design would be better without it, as while it's more discrete than a handle it still can lead to the baby accidentally knocking it out of their mouth. I figure this is for some kind of accessory, but it's really annoying.ppreciate about this one compared to other nipple like designs like Binky:<br /><br />- The entire pacifier is silicone so if the baby falls asleep on it or it gets under them it doesn't cause them discomfort<br />- They're ridiculously cheap.

simply, the review title says it all - best baby activity center, ever!<br /><br />i looked at pretty much every activity center, jumperoo, exersaucer, etc  everywhere, all over the internet. i decided to go with this one and i am soo glad i did.<br /><br />this center has a major advantage over all others - the walk along feature. baby can walk back and forth across the piano in the seat. i really debated between this and something that could bounce because i just thought baby would prefer to bounce, but i definitely made the right decision.<br /><br />baby boy is 6 months old and on the shorter side. he fits this just fine and actually learned to walk back and forth in it very quickly - by the 2nd time in it, he was a pro! i have to believe this will help with his development with walking in general.<br /><br />it is so much better than a stationary exersaucer or bouncer where they just sit in one spot, bounce and spin around.<br /><br />baby boy was always hard to keep entertained. he got bored so easily. constantly had to change postions, activities, areas of the house for new scenery etc. that has changed since buying this step'n play. he is content in it for so long and has so much to do in it. he also has the &#34;freedom&#34; to move and walk along. he can turn easily to each side, playing music with the light up keys or admiring himself in the mirror on the other side, for long periods of time.<br /><br />the added ability to walk along in this is a great feature, it may seem like its just a few steps in either direction, but that is plenty enough, trust me. when he is done playing in here, he is tuckered out and ready for a nap. usually when he is done with an activity he is just bored and ready to move on to something else.<br /><br />he quickly learned that his feet were making noise on the piano on the base and that encourages him to &#34;dance&#34; wildly :)  they really get a lot of exercise in this thing.<br /><br />each colored piano key on the base plays a different note. each light up piano key on the tray area also plays a different note.<br /><br />the round green light up button will play a tune or tune with singing a song, depending which setting you have it on. you can set it to just play notes and melodies, or it can also sing different songs for each piano key.<br /><br />the yellow round light up button spins and plays drum sounds. the only improvement i can think of for this center is to actually have an area to drum on, instead of just the yellow spinning button. its ok though because baby quickly learned that he can bang on the tray with the maraca or tambourine toys that are attached.<br /><br />on each side of the seat there are spin/noisy toys.<br /><br />the seat spins so easily, so it is easy for baby to switch between each side of activities.<br /><br />the non musical side is fun as well. it is also so fun to watch baby admire himself in the mirror, checking himself out.<br /><br />the saxophone doesn't make any noise. the bell has a very slight jingle to it as you push it back and forth.<br /><br />this center has 2 volume levels and the batteries seem to actually last quite long, surprisingly, and i buy the cheap batteries from the dollar tree. it is easy to put together - took me about 10 minutes. you attach the green legs to top and bottom, put the cover in the seat, place the seat on the track (it locks in place securely) and then snap in the maraca, tambourine and mirror, put the batteries in and you are ready to go!<br /><br />there is a small removable snack tray, but we don't use that because baby does not get snacks while playing in here - i don't want food slobbers all over it lol. the seat cover can be removed and washed in the washing machine though.<br /><br />once your little one is walking on their own, you can remove the seat and they can stand and play and walk through.<br /><br />this is hands down one of the best baby products i have come across. i love it, the baby loves it and it is definitely worth the price!s it and it is definitely worth the price!
i bought a second hand swing at a thrift store and used it every day for about a month before the motor died; our baby loves to swing for naps and when i'm showering, cooking or otherwise can't hold her.  i immediately began researching for a new swing and ordered this one sunday night.  the swing arrived the following friday afternoon. she and we love this swing!       our baby is 12 lbs, 24 inches, 11 weeks old.  the seat is deep so we have to put a little pillow in the bottom for her to sit on, otherwise she slides forward and is too slumped to be comfortable.  i'm glad the swing is deep because she'll be able to use it as she grows.  i've read reviews that said the tray is hard to open and makes a loud noise; i find the tray easy to open with one hand and it's very quiet if you're careful.  if you're in a hurry it does make a snapping sound as it clicks into place.  we ditched the mobile because it interferes with the swinging arm (as someone else noted in his review) and the toys are directly over the baby's head where she can't see them anyway.  will have to think of a solution when baby really starts noticing toys.    the swing has 6 settings; we use the high setting to calm her and help her get to sleep as recommended by dr.karp in \\happiest baby on the block\\, then put the swing on a low setting while she sleeps.  the swing has a timer option but if you don't use the timer, it doesn't automatically shut off as other swings do. we like that it works continuously since she sleeps in the swing at night (right beside my side of the bed where i hear her every sniff and sigh). she was sleeping five hours at a time in her co-sleeper but in the swing she sleeps up to 12 hours with one night-time feeding.       i feel comfortable letting her sleep in the swing since we swaddle her tightly (also rec. by karp) and the swing is deep as noted above.  we don't use the complicated 5 point straps since we swaddle her and use the tray for restraint.  even when she isn't swaddled we feel safe leaving her unstrapped (with an adult monitoring in the same room) and she is very active--always kicking and flailing her arms while awake.  she can't turn herself over yet though, so we may have to use the straps later.  another reason we feel safe letting her sleep in the swing is that even with poor neck strength at this age, her head doesn't flop forward even on the highest setting.  i haven't had to adjust the swing back so can't comment on that; when we first put it together she reclined nicely in it.     i'm thrilled so far with the battery life.  we've been using the swing every day and night for nine days now; we frequently use the high setting and the batteries show no sign of slowing.    others have commented that the music is boring and \\nature sounds\\ are horrible.  they are.  we don't use the music since she doesn't seem to care about it and we'd be better off turning on a cd of classical music instead.  we don't use the nature sounds either since we use a floor fan for white noise that she likes, but in defense of graco (whether they planned this or not) karp points out that babies love white noise which is what the \\nature sounds\\ sound like.  white noise is similar to what baby hears in the womb--a loud shhhhhh as blood rushes through mother's circulatory system.     the swing is very quiet even on the high setting; as i said she sleeps in it beside me and i'm a light sleeper.      while the swing is bulky, i'm still able to pick it up and move it daily from bedroom to living room to kitchen without too much trouble.  it's bulky but not heavy.  the legs do fold for storage.    so the cons for us---mobile is useless, have to push \\off\\ button up to six times to get the swing to stop swinging, straps are laughably complicated---maybe to prevent older children from removing baby before mom has a chance to notice??  maybe to prevent lawsuits??        pros for us---deep, large, comfy seat; weight limit 30lbs instead of more common 25lbs; removable head immobilizer; quiet, easy to open tray; quiet motor; great speed settings; sturdy frame; fairly easy to move around house; no automatic shut off; long battery life with frequent swing use; removable, washable swing cover; easy to put together (30 minutes tops); reliable name brand; price is great esp. with free super saver shipping; and of course the baby loves this swing!     if the swing ends up having a short lifetime, i'll update my review.
I've listed WubbaNub pacifiers as must haves for many of my friends who are having babies. Let me tell you why...<br /><br />1) They don't roll when they are dropped (or thrown)<br />2) They are a much more recognizable and grab-able when you are digging in a diaper bag or retrieving it from where it was thrown in your car<br />3) They have the same pacifier as what we were given in the hospital<br />4) They come in a variety of animals so you can get one that matches your baby's personality<br />5) They last a long time<br />6) They are easier to find in the dark than a pacifier alone<br />7) Your baby will be able to hold this and put it in his/her own mouth much sooner than a pacifier alone<br />8) Your baby will enjoy being soothed by the pacifier, but also enjoy carrying it around like a lovie<br />9) They are easy to wash - either by hand with soap and water, or throw them in with your laundry<br />10) They are very affordable considering how long they last and the preference your baby will show towards it<br /><br />Babies are funny - they seem to have a preference for one pacifier over another. We tried offering several brands of pacifiers to the boys as we were given some as shower gifts. My boys (twins) refused them, and were only soothed by their Soothie pacifiers. However, every time we went out, if a pacifier was dropped, it was a scramble to locate it. One of ours ended up rolling under all of the pews at church and landed in front of the alter. That was embarrassing!<br /><br />We own the frog, turtle, brown puppy, and monkey. I initially purchased the frog and turtle around when my twins were 4 months and it hasn't been until recently that they've shown much wear. I think since my guys are teething now, they tend to chew and pull their pacifiers while biting them, causing the material the Soothie pacifiers are made of to tear. I always make sure to check the pacifiers for tears before giving them to my boys because I wouldn't want any part of the pacifier to break off and be swallowed.<br /><br />I have had to replace the pacifier on both the frog and the turtle recently (so about 12 months after purchase) but it was easy to do. I simply used my seam ripper to snip the threads holding the pacifier in the animals' mouths and hand sewed a new pacifier in. I do have sewing experience so this was easy for me to do. I used cotton wrapped poly thread for strength and durability and a very sharp needle. The Soothie pacifier was not difficult to sew through at all - I didn't even need a thimble.<br /><br />When you think about the fact that this is the pacifier your child will want over other pacifiers, that it will be a soothing thing to suck on AND be a soft thing to cuddle with, and that the life of this pacifier will probably be about 12 months, suddenly spending 12-20 on it doesn't seem so bad. Especially if you or a friends can sew a new pacifier into the mouth if ever needed.<br /><br />The only cons about this product is that I worry about germs getting trapped in the material. We inspect ours daily for grime and goo (and tears) and we wash them regularly. Also, as mentioned, we got to the point where the pacifiers were showing wear and tear and one of the pacifiers started ripping at the nipple. I am so glad I caught that before my child swallowed it on accident. This could happen with any pacifier though!

I've listed WubbaNub pacifiers as must haves for many of my friends who are having babies. Let me tell you why...<br /><br />1) They don't roll when they are dropped (or thrown)<br />2) They are a much more recognizable and grab-able when you are digging in a diaper bag or retrieving it from where it was thrown in your car<br />3) They have the same pacifier as what we were given in the hospital<br />4) They come in a variety of animals so you can get one that matches your baby's personality<br />5) They last a long time<br />6) They are easier to find in the dark than a pacifier alone<br />7) Your baby will be able to hold this and put it in his/her own mouth much sooner than a pacifier alone<br />8) Your baby will enjoy being soothed by the pacifier, but also enjoy carrying it around like a lovie<br />9) They are easy to wash - either by hand with soap and water, or throw them in with your laundry<br />10) They are very affordable considering how long they last and the preference your baby will show towards it<br /><br />Babies are funny - they seem to have a preference for one pacifier over another. We tried offering several brands of pacifiers to the boys as we were given some as shower gifts. My boys (twins) refused them, and were only soothed by their Soothie pacifiers. However, every time we went out, if a pacifier was dropped, it was a scramble to locate it. One of ours ended up rolling under all of the pews at church and landed in front of the alter.

we have two sets of the regalo bed rails so i will compare this safety first to those.<br /><br />this safety first bed rail was super easy to snap together.  easier than figuring out a playpen.  i had it together and on the bed in under 10 minutes and i even read the directions and disclaimers.  the regalos were a two person job and were annoying and hard.  why?  because of the metal legs that have to be attached and then that darn strap belt.<br /><br />the safety first bedrail is about four inches shorter than the regalo length wise, which isn't an issue for me.  the safety first is much shorter in height than the regalo, which i thought would be an issue but it isn't.  my son can climb over it when he's awake which isn't safe, but he doesn't thrash about where he would be lifted enough to fall over in his sleep.<br /><br />installing the safety first into the bed is so easy.  you just life the mattress and slide the legs under.  they have rubber grips on them so the legs don't slide out.  then you push the top of the tails down to snap them onto the mattress where you want them.  i had them too right at first and you just push the back buttons to release some of the tension.  one of our regalos lives on our master king bed for when the little one snuggles or falls asleep with us.  i can not tell you how hard it is to get the darn belt into the center under the mattress.  are the belts safer?  not in my opinion.  i have to tighten it all the time.  but the regalo is higher so that is nicer with the king size mattress.  so that being said, the safety first is a much easier install.<br /><br />with the safety first you lose about four inches of bed width because the rail is locked onto the mattress rather than the regalo that is on the side of the mattress.  i don't mind losing the bed space because there are no cracks for my little one to fall through.<br /><br />the safety first does not budge.  once locked on, i have pushed and pulled and that sucker is strong.  with the regalo i always have a crack that i have to wedge a pillow into so that my little one doesn't slip into it.  and he can push it pretty far out.  so annoying.<br /><br />making the beds.  the regalo stays on the king mattress when changing sheets but it's a pain.  it doesn't fold down like it's supposed to anymore so i have to work around it.  the safety first is so light and easy i take it off to change sheets.<br /><br />travel!  so my second regalo has been modified by me, regardless of safety warnings.  i wanted a bed rail for hotels and grandmas and the regalo was not like my old school one that just slid into the bed.  so i chopped off the belt and tossed it and my dad welded the bar to the legs.  it's clunky, but it works.  i know i'm not supposed to do that btw.  anyways, now i'm excited for our next trip to take this light weight, super easy no belt rail.  yeah!<br /><br />so yes, i like this product.  we have two beds that are just a mattress on a wood frame and it fits on them easily.  i don't have a pillow top so i'm not sure how it works on those.  i do have two memory foam mattresses that it works well on too.  you have to be careful not to make it too tight on the memory foam because these suckers can squeeze. with the regalo i had issues with the wood framed beds, it didn't fit into the wedges on both sides.<br /><br />also, please note this is just one bedrail.  but you could get one for each side if needed.<br /><br />rereading this i sound like a regalo hater and that's not entirely true.  like i said, they are longer and higher and are on the outside of the bed, so they are just a different type of rail.  for me personally i prefer the bedrails without the straps.with the regalo i always have a crack that i have to wedge a pillow into so that my little one doesn't slip into it.  and he can push it pretty far out.  so annoying.<br /><br />making the beds.  the regalo stays on the king mattress when changing sheets but it's a pain.  it doesn't fold down like it's supposed to anymore so i have to work around it.  the safety first is so light and easy i take it off to change sheets.<br /><br />travel!  so my second regalo has been modified by me, regardless of safety warnings.  i wanted a bed rail for hotels and grandmas and the regalo was not like my old school one that just slid into the bed.  so i chopped off the belt and tossed it and my dad welded the bar to the legs.  it's clunky, but it works.  i know i'm not supposed to do that btw.  anyways, now i'm excited for our next trip to take this light weight, super easy no belt rail.  yeah!<br /><br />so yes, i like this product.  we have two beds that are just a mattress on a wood frame and it fits on them easily.  i don't have a pillow top so i'm not sure how it works on those.  i do have two memory foam mattresses that it works well on too.  you have to be careful not to make it too tight on the memory foam because these suckers can squeeze. with the regalo i had issues with the wood framed beds, it didn't fit into the wedges on both sides.<br /><br />also, please note this is just one bedrail.  but you could get one for each side if needed.<br /><br />rereading this i sound like a regalo hater and that's not entirely true.  like i said, they are longer and higher and are on the outside of the bed, so they are just a different type of rail.  for me personally i prefer the bedrails without the straps.
these bags made all of my wildest breastmilk pumping and storing dreams come true!  i would give them 6 or 7 stars.<br /><br />they combine all of the good features of the other brands into one product, with none of the flaws that the other products have.<br /><br />i love these bags!<br /><br />okay, so here's the low down on these:<br /><br />- this is the new version of honeysuckle's breastmilk bags, which are designed to be used with a pump--you just pump right into them.<br /><br />the bags have little holes on the top part, so that you can attach them to a pump adapter.  so, for the full experience, you need a pump adapter or two, which you can get by purchasing a pack of bags made by your pump's manufacturer.  i bought these medela bags: [[asin:b007pexokw medela pump & save breastmilk bags with easy-connect adapter - 50 ct]] because i have a medela pump.  i don't know if adapters are interchangeable between brands.  then, use the medela bags if you want, so that you're not wasting, and so that you know how wonderful these honeysuckle bags are when you start using them.  whether or not you use the bags, keep the little plastic adapters.<br /><br />then get some of these honeysuckle breast pump bags, and you'll see how perfect they are.<br /><br />medela vs. honeysuckle<br />all right, so here are the reasons that i like this bag better than the medela bags:<br />1. the plastic is not as rigid as the medela bags, yet it is still thick enough that you don't have to worry about it.<br />2. get this: the honeysuckle bags fit the medela easy adapter better than the medela bags do!  with the medela bags, you have to put them on at just the right angle, and it's kind of a tight fit.  then removing the bags after you've pumped is...well, interesting.  the honeysuckle bags are easy to put on, and they still stay put while you're pumping, but then they are easy to remove when you're done.<br />3. the honeysuckle bags can be stored flat in the freezer so that it is easier to store more, instead of having a bunch of squatty bags like the medela ones.  or, you can store them upright if you prefer.  another nice thing about storing them flat is that they defrost more quickly when you're ready to use them.<br />4. the honeysuckle bags can fit more milk.  they are marked to 6 oz (medela is marked to 5 oz), but since they can be stored flat, there is also just a bunch of extra space.  so, if you fill a little more it doesn't create any problem.  the medela bags get kind of messy if you put any more than 5 oz.<br />5. the honeysuckle bags have two seals.  medela only has one, and it doesn't always seal perfectly.<br />6. the honeysuckle bags are much, much less expensive than medela bags: right now (based on the cost of packs of 50 bags on amazon) honeysuckle bags are about 23 cents each and medela bags are 40 cents each.  so, medela bags are almost double the cost of honeysuckle bags.<br /><br />those are the things that come to mind.<br /><br />lansinoh vs. honeysuckle<br />1. the lansinoh bags cannot attach to a pump directly.  so, you either have to pump into something else first or hold the bag the whole time you pump.<br />2. the seams on the lansinoh bags are thin--honeysuckle's seams are very thick, so you really don't have to worry about them splitting at all.<br />3. lansinoh bags are meant to be stored flat, which is great, but they are awkward to try to stand up (when you're filling them or actually using them). honeysuckle bags can also be stored flat, but they have a special bottom of the bag that makes it so that it can stand up well too.<br />4. lansinoh bags are partially sealed at the top, which is supposed to reassure us that the bags are sterile.  honeysuckle bags are completely sealed at the top, which is much more reassuring.<br />5. the label area on lansinoh bags is upside down (so that they are right-side up while in the freezer, maybe?).  regular honeysuckle bags have the writing right-side up, which i think is nice---but! these pump bags have no writing, so you can do your own thing, and if you want to put it right-side up or upside down, either will work.<br />6. lansinoh bags are considered the cheap brand; right now on amazon each bag works out to about 21 cents.  at only 23 cents each right now, honeysuckle bags are very comparable in price, while the quality is far superior.<br /><br />i am aware that there are a few other brands of bags out there, but i haven't tried them.  i started with medela bags, switched to lansinoh but didn't even finish the package of those, switched back to medela, started buying non-pump honeysuckle bags--which are also very good, and just heard about these.  i won't be switching brands again, because i can't think of anything i would want to be different.<br /><br />if you're considering these bags, i definitely recommend that you buy them.  you won't regret it.  the only thing that is kind of a pain about them is that they are not available in any stores near me, so i have to get them online.  that just means i have to plan ahead a little, but i can handle that.  every time i order bags from honeysuckle (this was my third order), i have received them within a few days, so shipping time is also minimal.ice---but!
