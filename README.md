# MachineLearning 
This is a data visualization and human-computer interaction experiment code section. Here we process data for sun's three products, each with fifteen thousand data.
Each dataset contains customer reviews, ratings for products and some other information. 
For the review, we used natural language processing in machine learning to implement text sentiment analysis, two GTX3090 graphics cards to train the model,
the model was saved in a model1 file, and also used the time data prediction method to predict the reputation of the product (defined by the formula given by the literature reference) to predict the data after the year. 
Finally, a gray correlation analysis is used to process the degree of association between the review text and the star rating.
