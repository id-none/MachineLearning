Wouldn't work.  Have to return it.  The word 'door' keeps showing up as if there is a problem with the door.<br />There is no problem.
Worthless.  Stopped working after less than two years.  The repair place said it would be about $200.00 to fix it.  If you're like me, you are considering a Frigidaire because they're cheaper.  Do yourself a favor and spend a little more on another brand.
Worse product I've ever owned, I purchased the older model JVM17501MM on 06/29/2011 and it completely failed on 03/3132013, GE serviceman came to my home on 04/05/2013 and gave me a discounted (50% p&l) repair bill of $240.00. My consumer advocate at GE offered me a replacement of $250.00, funny since this item is selling all over for under $200.00. I will NEVER purchase any product from GE AGAIN. You should stay away. RUN away from this.
works fines initially then as the title says I literally got a puff of black smoke and it was dead.
Worked great for the first 2 years than completely broken.  AFter charging me $99 to look at my microwave, the GE repairman indicated that the repair would cost over $400.  Wow - what a ripoff.  I expected a profile to last a little longer than that.  If you want to replace this in 2 years - go ahead and buy.  Otherwise, look for a brand other than GE.
worked for 1/2 day.
Worked fine for 13 months then it stop heating food and it does not show any error messages. Searched on online for a solution to the problem and found that running the fan on high works for some people. I gave it a try and YES it does work. The only way to heat our food is by turning the fan on HIGH before setting the time and pushing the start button. Our microwave is installed under a cabinet but not above any stove or range, so steam or moisture is not the problem. I called Samsung and their only solution was for me to buy their extended warranty for $250.00 for one year. I told them No Thanks, if I'm going to spend more money on a microwave it won't be on a Sumsung.
With a 1 year warranty this microwave lasted, of course, 13 months. Used to trust GE, but I'll be looking elsewhere for a new microwave and everything else for that matter. Problem is I read the bad reviews before I purchased it but figured it would at least last a couple of years, but instead just 1 month past the warranty period. Strongly suggest you do not purchase at least this model, think I'll try another company myself.
wish I had read reviews on the GE microwaves before purchasing one..Totally fried after only 2 years..Stay away from over the range GE microwaves..Junk
Wish I had checked Amazon before buying. As of today, not one review higher than 2 stars. I have to agree. Ours just crapped out shortly after the one-year warranty. Anyway,with most warranties, it's simpler to just buy a replacement rather than go through the hassle and expense of repair. It wouldn't be so bad if this was a countertop model, but when you have to install something, you don't want to drag it out and leave a gaping hole in your kitchen. I will avoid ANY Frigidaire appliance from now on.
Whirlpool,<br /><br />Check out these reviews!!  Obviously there is a serious defect.  Although it sounds like ours lasted longer than most (24 months).  Like others have written, we are not very heavy microwave users....the occassional reheating of coffee or defrosting of meat.  Seems ridiculous to me!
Whirlpool &#34;GOLD&#34;. I thought I was getting the &#34;best&#34; kitchen appliances...NOT!!!  I have to press the Clear button after every cycle to reset it. I also have to wait about 1-2 minutes, after every cycle, with the door open, for the light to come back on (or it will not reset). Because it has been just over 1 year since purchase, whirlpool will do nothing for me other than refer me to one of their overpriced repair people.  Never again whirlpool...
While searching for others with the same problem we're having I found these reviews: our Advantium died in about 2 1/2 years. We work from home and, one day, smelled smoke that we traced to our Advantium which was turned off and that had been turned off for some time. It was hot to the touch. We unplugged the Advantium and the the smoke smell went away: it had spontaneously turned on and was melting itself down. Plugging it back in turns it on without pressing any buttons. GE says this is not a fire hazard because there are supposed to be safety's to prevent it from burning down the house. I'm not so sure -- their credibility is shot -- but even if there are those safety's are built with the same low quality as the Advantium so cannot be reasonably relied upon. GE says the problem is with the keypad but that there aren't any more keypads to buy, probably because they all fail. The Advantium is a piece of junk. Save yourself money and protect your family from this potential fire hazard: avoid GE appliances.    [Update: after several calls and an eternity on hold GE acknowledged the problem and send a tech with a new Advantium that seems to be working well. I wouldn't buy another -- there are clearly QA issues with the Advantium -- but after lots of time on the phone GE did make this right. I'd still prefer a different manufacturer though and wish I'd bought a different cooker. If you're in the market for a microwave/cooker buy a different one.]
When I opened the box, I saw the corner next to the push button was lose.  The thin and cheap stainless steel is only on the front, everything else is either painted metal and plastic.   I can't believe that the seller Abes of Maine Cameras and Electronics did not check the product before ship to the customer
What I like about the Whirlpool/Kitchen Aid microwaves is they offer models with Accuwave cooking.  When you cook at 50% power, it cooks at 50% power rather than cycling on and off at 100% power, for 50% of the time.  This makes a massive difference on how things cook.  We previously had a GH5184XPS with Accuwave that lasted 4 years before it stopped cooking.  It was starting to not look so nice from normal use, so I decided to go with a new one instead of repairing the old one.      After the new microwave was installed, I tried a cup of water in it.  When I started it, it sounded like an arc welder, and when I looked at the plastic panel on the right side where the magnetron is, it looked like an arc torch flame.  I quickly turned it off so it wouldn't burn the place down.  They took it back and gave me another.  The very night we got it, we were making popcorn in the special Microwave Popcorn bowl, which we had used for years with our other microwaves.  Within a minute, we got an F7 - Call For Service code.  They offered to exchange it for a new one, but didn't have another, but told me they could sell me the new 5184, and updated model of our old one.  I noticed that the new one had a broiler, slightly different menus, $50 cheaper, and we had good luck with our previous 5184.  However, after it was installed, the cook said, this doesn't cook right.  I checked it out.  The updated 5184 no longer has Accuwave.  That isn't how it was represented, so I gave them their $50 back and had them order another one of these from the factory.  That went along for 3 days before we noticed that part way through the cooking time, the magnetron noise would stop, the fan speed up, the light got brighter, and the food stopped cooking.  Since the chicken was still pink, I added 2 minutes at full power, and immediately received an F7 code.  The problem actually started when it stopped cooking during the previous operation.  You don't get the F7 until you try to start it again,and the magnetron doesn't start.  We couldn't trust it with chicken.  We avoided certain foods and alternated between manual and automatic cycles to get around the F7 codes.  As time progressed, we could do less and less.  Now, you can't even trust it to finish a bowl of oatmeal.      That was enough for me.  There is no possibility of buying a good one from the factory, so there is no point in getting another new one.  Thus, I decided I would use warranty service to see if they can put in good parts that WILL work.  The dealer-recommended warranty repair source wouldn't take the job when he learned which model it was.  Whirlpool got another company to come the following morning.  They put a large bowl of water in the microwave to test it, and could find nothing wrong.  They said their manual doesn't even list an F7 code.  There is nothing easier on a microwave than a large bowl of water.  I went on the internet and printed off one of a myriad of postings about F7 for this microwave model, with detail instructions on how to troubleshoot.  Then I put real food in the microwave and showed them how easy it is to get an F7.  Included in the troubleshooting instructions were comments from the techs that service these every day who state that they always go through the procedure to eliminate any other causes, but it always ends up being the expensive microprocessor board.  The on-site techs did not follow the checklist, and called the factory.  The factory told them they will send them a switch to try.  (I was hoping it would be the thermal switch, but the techs indicated it was not.)  The on-site techs reminded the factory that the problem starts mid-cycle.  The factory came back with, as it gets hotter, the switch contacts may be increasing resistance, causing the problem.  I could repeat the F7 at will.  They did not check the switch for high resistance nor follow the factory procedure to troubleshoot the F7 error.  Next Wednesday, the switch is scheduled to be delivered, and the techs will be returning to put it in.  The service company also had little confidence in the factory's recommendation, but they have to do what the factory says.  Perhaps the fist service company has gone through this before and may be why they wouldn't take the job for this model.      I've been through 3 of this model, and 4 installs, since April 5 2011, and I don't have a good microwave yet.  They've eaten up more of my time than the microwave is worth.  Now it's my turn.  I will make it my personal mission to require them to keep sending technicians to my house to fix this model until it works as advertised, on real food, or supply me with a model of equal to or greater value, that works as advertised, for free, and with a new warranty.
We used this brand new microwave for 3 weeks, and last night it caught fire while we were microwaving food.<br /><br />The food was not burnt, or overcooked. In fact it still had a minute more to go, when I noticed flames inside, at the top fan assembly region. We were able to put it out with a damp towel, but the entire top section was melted to reveal the electrical wiring inside.<br /><br />We googled to see if anyone had a similar problem and found the review posted just a week earlier hear on Amazon. This is clearly not some random freak accident, but a recurring problem with this microwave.<br /><br />If you have this microwave, do not leave it unattended while microwaving. If you are considering purchasing it, please please do not do it.
We really enjoyed using this microwave while it lasted; however, after 2 1/2 years of use it just stopped working one day. We chose this drawer-type microwave because we wanted to &#34;hide&#34; our microwave in our island for aesthetic purposes, and for this reason, were willing to pay more for it.  If I could do it again, I would definitely have splurged for one of the more expensive drawer microwaves that are available from manufacturers other than Sharp.  Yes, Sharp makes the cheapest version of this type of microwave, but we learned the hard way that you get what you pay for.
We read all the negative reviews but decided to take a chance anyway as this was the only size microwave that fit the cabinet space we had. Big mistake. 1yr 2months after we bought it the magnetrom(?) stopped working - the microwave no longer heats anything. Called for service and since labor is out of warranty it would cost us $180 to get it fixed. Even before that some of the exterior plastic pieces had actually come off and we had just taped it back on.<br />Well, we're NOT buying another one of these nor getting it fixed. We've chosen to re-do the cabinet because in the long run it will be cheaper than to keep buying a poorly built product that lasts just past its 1 yr warranty. Will be staying away from GE products as well.
We purchases this microwave in April 2014, loved the drawer/cupboard installation.  July 2, 2014 we woke up to a very bad burning odor from the microwave, it was nit in use.  We contacted Sharp and they scheduled a service company to have a look at it.  It will be 5 weeks this Sat. & we still do not have a microwave.  We have been informed now by Sharp after two service calls that our microwave need to be picked up and taken off site to be tested.<br />I would never purchase this microwave again and wished I had read the reviews prior to purchasing it.  The burning odor is obviously a problem now that I read the reviews.
We purchased this microwave, and then realized that 2 cu ft. is WAY too big for a family of three. We hoped to exchange it for a smaller one.<br /><br />Sharp told us that we were responsible for shipping (fair enough), but also that we would have to pay a 30% restocking fee.<br /><br />This is absurd. Who's ever heard of a 30% restocking fee? We never even removed this from the cardboard box- we simply opened the top, and then re-closed it. 30% seems like usury to me. Frankly, I can't believe Amazon would allow a merchant to charge a 30% restocking fee. I'm positive their Cost of Goods Sold isn't much more than 30%... what are they doing, just trashing returns?<br /><br />Anyway, even if I were going to buy a Sharp microwave again, I certainly wouldn't buy it HERE, and reward these unfair business practices.<br /><br />We own a business, and we expect to be treated as consumers, the same way we treat our customers.. that simply isn't happening here.
We purchased this microwave in Oct 2011 and it stopped heating in June 2013.  The defective part is the magnetron.  The magnetron has a 5 year warranty but it will cost $90 and 3 days for GE to come to my home to confirm that is the problem.  Then I am told I can expect to pay another $250-$300 for the labor for them to come back out and replace the magnetron, no idea how long that will take.  Fighting with GE at the moment to have the part shipped to my local repair man who said he would replace for $99 total.  Warranty information does not say anything about it having to be replace by a GE tech.<br /><br />We bought all new GE appliances in October 2011 and so far we have had to have the fridge and now the microwave repaired in the first 2 years.  I guess we still have the range and dishwasher to look forward to fixing.<br />I thought GE was a good company but experience has cleared things up.
We purchased the MW in Janurary, our contractor installed it the last week of April, it died two days later and Sharp service took three weeks/ two service calls only to have it go out ten minutes after they left. Amazon assures me that it will be resolved but not the seller. They want to repeatly waste our time and call service, have us wait then what? DON'T BUY THIS MICROWAVE.
We purchased our Samsung over the range microwave 14 months ago.  We started getting the 5e but it would clear up overnight.  Then it got so none of the keyboard would not work. I guess we'll have to buy a new microwave but it definitely won't be a Samsung.
We purchased our Samsung MW (SMH9187W)three years ago.  It now has an SE error.  As others reported, Samsung told us to flip the breaker switch, etc., but a few minutes later, the same SE message came up, along with incessant beeping. Called Samsung back and we were passed around for about half an hour.  Called Lowe's (where we bought it) - said it would probably cost $150 to fix it and it should have lasted five years.  To us, not worth fixing.  Will NEVER buy another Samsung appliance.
We purchased our oven in December 2011. No problems until recently when we tried to start the oven it would show &#34;pause&#34; on the display and not come on at all. Now it just comes on if the door is closed and nothing has been entered on the key pad. Short lived junk as far as I am concerned. My last microwave lasted 5 times as long and was still working when I gave it away to go to this over the oven unit. Quality is long gone.
We purchased a new house which led us to purchase a new microwave and refrigerator.  We chose GE for both.  After six months the ice maker stopped working.  After 6 years, a refrigerator which still looks brand new, was freezing all of the food in the refrigerator section.  Next came the refrigerator section not cooling at all.  We had to go purchase yet another refrigerator as we couldn't deal with our food going back all the time based on the reliability of this refrigerator.  Moved this GE refrigerator down the basement to use for excess drinks, etc. during the holidays.  Repair man just left after telling me it was too expensive to fix and he would not guarantee that something else didn't go wrong.  Oh yeah, forgot to mention, my GE microwave broke last week also.  After reading the reviews/complaints on GE appliances, I will never ever put a GE appliance in my house.  Spread the word.....
We purchased a home in 2013 with this already installed.  The original owners had to get it repaired once.  Since it doesn't have a turn table, it does not heat food evenly and it creates hot spots on dishes.  I have broken 3 very expensive hand made dinner plates due to the hot spots on the stoneware.  I've had the plates for 15 years with no issues.  I did buy a $30 turntable from amazon to help, but this microwave is not worth it.  We still use our old sharp countertop convention microwave and prefer it over this one.  Also, sometimes you have to let the drawer open all the way before you can shut it, which can be annoying.
We owned this unit over 3 years.  The electronics went bad after a year.  It took 6 tries to get it working.  As reported elsewhere in these reviews, the machine would turn on all by itself.  Scary and dangerous.  Whirlpool would not replace the unit.  I wonder why these units weren't recalled.    The plastic parts (not a stainless steel unit) distorted and cracked in several places.  Those parts were replaced (under a separate warranty contract) 3 times!  The unit again has cracks and no warranty.  Last week, the bottom part of the door handle pulled out of the unit; it's held in by a small rubber flange that is sandwiched between the outer glass and an inner flat plastic piece.  Websites tell me that the glass must be disassembled to get a new handle inserted!  Gad!  It's outta here.  And the real shame is that the cooking functions are excellent.  But the next one will not be a Whirlpool, nor any other of Whirlpool brands. (Whirlpool makes/owns Whirlpool, KitchenAid, Admiral, Amana, Jenn-Air, Magic Chef, and Maytag.)
We own this microwave in black. Installed in 2010, slow to cook for 3 years, and finally broke in 2013 - magnetron went out. Too costly to repair, so replaced with a Whirlpool unit (fingers crossed). 3 years for an appliance that requires install - WHAT A JOKE! I also had a GE range break in less than 3 years. I own multiple rental houses and used to count on GE. Now I will NEVER buy a GE appliance again!
We never had the SE error but at 16 months the microwave, sparked, growled, then smoked like crazy out of the top.  It is now DOA and out of warranty.
We moved into a house that already had the MCO160UW microwave oven installed. After a few months the microwave would stop working and then randomly run on by its self for 3 minutes and 30 seconds. After deciding the microwave needed to be replaced for safety reasons we looked for another. We purchased one with the same length and width but after installing it realized the adjacent cabinet door wouldnt open since it  is at an angle due to the microwave sticking out too far from the wall. The standard size is 16'deep and up. Anything over 15' deep will stick out too far for the cabinet to open and the ONLY microwave available anywhere with 14.9' depth was this one. We desperately needed a new microwave so decided to give this same model, MCO160UW, a second try it failed again after 1 week of use. It will not run longer than 1 minute and 30 seconds at a time until it shuts off. In order to use it again you must wait a few minutes for it to turn back on. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.
We loved this microwave. It had the perfect features, aesthetics and price.<br /><br />Except it quit working. Three (3) separate times. We have had to take off work three (3) times to wait for service technicians only to have the unit fail again.  The issues began within the first five (5) months and have continued.<br /><br />The problem is that the unit will turn on, motor running, turntable turning, light on, but no heat is generated. Food comes out at same temperature it went in. It has been the same issue each time the unit stopped working properly.<br /><br />Most frustratingly, at my last call to Amana, I pointed out that they have spent more in repair costs ($400+) than the original cost of the unit. In the interests of everyone's time, it seemed reasonable to try replacing the unit.  I was told by Jason and Chris (supervisor) that Amana's policy was to repair not replace, so only option was A FOURTH service call to report the problem (per policy). I asked Chris whom I should direct concerns about this policy, and he said Customer Service.<br /><br />Less than helpful. I was fairly certain that I was already speaking with Customer Service. I never was provided with an eMail address, physical address or alternate phone number to express concerns about the policy. Bad business model.<br /><br />We are going to replace this unit with a Samsung, one of Consumer Reports highly rated machines. Yes, it cost a little more, but the Amana has become excessively expensive in time and frustration. Never again.
We loved the small size & appearance.  Unfortunately, it worked for the first 3 days, so we through away the box.  Before the week was over, it wouldn't heat anything no matter how long we set the timer for, or what power setting we used.  Without the box, it can't be returned. A complete waste of money.  DO NOT BUY THIS MICROWAVE, or if you feel like gambling, at least SAVE THE BOX!
We just purchased a brand new home towards the end of April 2013 which had this microwave installed. There was no power in the house until we purchased it and we have already had the SE error code twice now. Even though the item was never used prior to April it is considered out of warranty because it was purchased in 2011. One of the reasons we picked this house was because of the brand new appliances. Samsung really blew it on this one. When we finally get the $$$ to replace this it will be with Frigidaire.  At least those still work in my home...
We installed this microwave three months ago and it was working well until several days ago when we set the convection bake to heat at 375 degrees and after 15 minutes the device completely shutdown.  It has completely died.  I set up an evaluation and repair with GE (between 8 - 12 am) and by 11 30 am, they still hadn't showed up and I needed to leave for the office.  BTW, I had a similar experience when I scheduled a repair for my GE washer.  I will never by GE again!  After 3 months, to have problems with a brand new appliance is unacceptable.
We initially were happy with our purchase of this microwave, although it did not have the features of the older, more expensive Dacor microwave it replaced.  The size was great, and we liked the easy clean interior.<br /><br />However, six months after it was purchased (right before Christmas), it failed totally - would not power up at all.  I called Samsung customer service, they said a tech would get in touch shortly.  After 3 days a local repair company called to say they only came to our area once a week, so it would be several days before they could stop by.  We're 30 miles from Salt Lake City in Park City, a major resort town with a winter population of 100,000 people, so it's not like we're in the sticks.<br /><br />Nine days after I called, the repair service showed up.  He repaired one part, then stated that the magnetron was damaged, and that he would need to take the microwave to his shop for more diagnosis and repair.  Then he would have to order parts, then he would bring it back when his route brought him to our area again - so, two more weeks at least (assuming Samsung has the parts in stock).  On the way out of the door he banged the microwave into our door frame, putting a major dent in it.<br /><br />I called Samsung customer service again, and stated that I thought three weeks or more was too long to repair the unit.  They blamed the tech for not bringing all the parts he might need (what, a whole microwave?) but refused to offer to even expedite parts to the repair shop to cut a week off the time, let alone discuss any kind of replacement.<br /><br />With a family of 5, we use a microwave multiple times a day.  Samsung should have better quality in the first place.  When they have a failure, they need to have a better repair and support system in place, and if they can't do better than 3 weeks or more to repair an appliance that gets used daily, that's not good enough for me.  Do you need a failure like this right before you have family coming for the holidays? Would you be happy to spend weeks with a giant empty space in your kitchen where your microwave (and oven hood) was?<br /><br />We don't. No more Samsung appliances for us.  And good luck to Samsung in taking on Whirlpool, Bosch, Asko, Panasonic, etc. - the other appliances we have in our house which have worked great with daily use for years.  I'm off to the store for another brand of microwave, look for this one on eBay - still under warranty!<br /><br />By the way, we tried to post a version of this review (edited in accordance with Samsung.com's review guidelines) on Samsung.com, where Samsung supposedly allows customers to rate their products (and this microwave currently has a 4 star review).  We received a notice today that they would not post our review--no rationale, only that it did not meet their standards. BUYER BEWARE!
We have had this microwave for 2 months. It makes the scariest noises, like there is metal in it but there is not. The plate also does not spin properly. Very low quality. Go with a brand you trust!
We had this for less than 2 years and the door handle fell off. It is held onto the microwave door with cheap plastic parts.
We had the prior model of GE Cafe Microwave, which completely died after 3months.  It was like pulling teeth to get GE to do anything about it, however they finally agreed to replace it if I paid for deliverer and installation. We went two months without a microwave.  This new replacement model isn't much better.  The fake metal over the plastic handle started peeling off after a week and the display dimmed. They did replace the handle, but they said they can't do anything about this display as its not covered.<br /><br />As for using the microwave, it is a pain. There is no keypad, so you have to dial in all of the time.  Sometimes you press the dial to select something, other times you press a button.  It is not intuitive at all and is very hard to use.  I can't wait for it to completely die so I can buy a different brand.
WE had a GE microwave oven burst into flames for no apparent reason.<br />My wife was reheating cup of coffee when the fire occurred. She cut the power and the flame immediately stopped. Her quick thinking averted what could have been a nasty housefire.<br />It was a 2 year old GE Spacemaker Model JVM 1540DP1WW.<br /><br />Our previous Microwave was a similar model GE Spacemaker which quit working at age 3, but did not catch fire.<br /><br />GE assigned a case # 1316274<br /><br /> I sent a report to the USPSC.<br />While researching microwave fires today, I learned that there have been many similar fires reported to GE and the USPSC but neither party has taken any action....GE continues to sell this dangerous appliance and the FEDs continue to record the incidents, but take no action.
We got the whole  suite of Whirlpool appliances with our new house. Every piece: fridge, dishwasher and this microwave gave us only grief and never ending service calls. And this is after only 4 months of using them, they all fall apart. This oven has a nice display, however, while cooking the door sucks in all the water vapor from below cooking top and the moisture sits there for hours where all the electronics are. It is hooked up to the outside vent however it blows all the hot air back to the kitchen instead of the pipe in the wall. I have technician look at it again this weekend. Save yourself the aggravation and  but Samsung or other high quality brand, Whirlpool quality is a history at this point.
We bought this, from Amazon, in July.  No issues.  Installed it and it worked great--for less than 4 months.  The microwave stopped working 3 days before Thanksgiving.  Called factory service, 2 weeks.  The appointment is scheduled for 8-12.  They show up at 11:55.  They stay until 2:00--yup it's broke, but we need parts and 2 people.  2 more weeks, parts are shipped to our house and service calls to confirm they are here.  (Factory service that doesn't have parts--interesting way to do business!)  They show up at 11:58--seriously.  Two hours (and another vacation day burned) and the replacement parts are defective.  (Warm fuzzy--not!)  Two more weeks--and they canceled their appointment.  Seems it takes two people to install it and the wonderful factory service only scheduled one.    So the top of the line microwave with convection oven will spend Christmas in the garage.  My newly remodeled kitchen a gaping hole with metal mounting plate for all my guests to admire.    I have e-mailed Whirlpool--will update if and when we get this very frustrating and disappointing mess resolved.    Thinking of buying this brand/item--save yourself--don't!      Update 12-28-09:  Well they canceled their appointment to fix it again.  They now have us waiting another 2 weeks before they can get someone to try and fix it.  Whirlpool customer service contacted us and said the only option we have is to get it fixed, they will not replace their defective equipment.  So it is still sitting in my garage waiting for someone to show up.      The great news is Santa did bring me a microwave to sit on my counter just in case my hopes that the repairmen soon will be here wouldn't happen.  It is a Sharp.  Bare bones model but it works! Santa is a wise man!    Oh--and where will my Whirlpool microwave be spending New Year's?  The garage.    February 28--after 5 more appointments--2 of which they failed to show Whirlpool agreed to replace the microwave.  We have the new one 3 days.  I do enjoy this microwave, I have my fingers crossed it will be reliable.      If you have problems, keep good records, stay with factory authorized service and be persistent.
We bought this to replace our GE that died after several services. Turned out to be very cheesy and after the warranty ran out the door handle cracked and then finally broke off. We will be replacing this with a GE which we should've done from the get go. This was a low price microwave but as the old saying goes...you get what you pay for . Some items can't be skimped on.
We bought this microwave in the summer of 2011. It did not heat even when first installed. Whirlpool sent a repairman who fixed it, only after three months of work and making several orders for different parts. Six months later, it stopped heating again. We have asked for a replacement but Whirlpool will only send the repairman again. They will not replace the product even though we have been unable to use it less than half the time we have owned it. This product is a lemon and not supported by the manufacturer. I have read many other reviews that indicate the same thing. We will never buy Whirlpool or any other brand made by this company again! We desire to buy American, but not at the cost of buying inferior products from a company with lousy customer service!
We bought this microwave cause it matched the GE Profile Range we had purchased previously.  It looks great!<br />However, after less than 2 months of use, we had to replace the over the range light bulbs; which is apparently a common issue from the reviews on the ge website.  Worked fine for a year after that.  Last week we had an issue where the microwave started beeping to notify us that there was an issue with the keypad.  Turning the power saver off and on cleared the message, and we continued to use it uninterrupted for another week; until yesterday.  After heating lunch, I tried to warm a bottle of milk in this microwave.  After 30 seconds it was still cold, so I tried again.  At that point the microwave filled with smoke and the kitchen started to smell like something was burning.  We were told by the sales guy at the store that it is the magnatron that went (which is covered under warranty, but the labor is not; not to mention the $99 just to have the GE repair guy come to my house.  It sounds like something I wouldn't trust to be repaired.<br />I DEFINITELY DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT!
We bought this Microwave at Lowes.  I think I would have a better chance at solving a Rubik's than installing the thing over the stove so we hired our handyman to do it.<br /><br />The microwave performs OK but the stainless steel began rusting in 9 months.  It is now pockmarked with rust and getting uglier every day.<br /><br />I regret this purchase.<br /><br />UPDATE:  Here I am a little more than a year after posting my original 1-star review, and I'm wishing there was zero star option.  One day about 2 hours after dinner the light inside the microwave randomly came on all by itself! The unit was previously off. Upon closer inspection we noticed not only was the light on, but the turntable was also turning. If we open the door, the turntable stops spinning. If we close it, it begins again. And the light remains on.<br /><br />Sometimes when we're done cooking something it will power off normally like its supposed to and we get lulled into a false sense that it fixed itself. But then it will randomly come on again later.<br /><br />It's acting like its possessed.  My guess is that all LG products are pure evil, and should be avoided.
We bought this microwave 2 years ago as part of a home remodel. It was great while it worked but recently stopped working. Sharp warranty is only 1 year. For the amount of money we spent on this I would expect it to last more than 2 years.
We bought this Frigidiare microwave in the hopes of getting a solid over the range microwave to use.  Before it was two years old it began to smoke and sputter as it began to burn up.  We killed the power and shut it down.  We contacted Frigidaire and were told it was out of warranty.  We told them we were reporting a safety hazard that they should be aware of.  We were told that it was impossible for the microwave to do what ours had done.  No support, rejection of safety hazard report, no offer of repair or replacement.<br /><br />We think you will regret buying this product.  We do.  Complete waste of money.
We bought this for our kitchen remodel to fit in the island in July 2012.  I don't like having the micro over the stove because I do a lot of canning and wanted a great range hood.  The heat from canning tends to melt the electronics in micros over the stove after about a few seasons.<br />Once it was in, I was never completely happy because it took a long time to reheat food and didn't seem to reheat evenly.  Not a big deal since we only used it for leftovers....and it looked good tucked away under the counter.<br />When I bought it, I couldn 't find many reviews on it - good or bad, but figured it would be fine-especially with the high price tag.<br />Wrong!<br />It just died with no warning.  Our $199 over the stove micros lasted longer!  I could have melted 4 or 5 of those for the price of this one!<br />I'm going to try to fix it because now I have a custom island built to fit this specific microwave.  Save your money, buy a countertop model and whatever you do,  DO NOT build cabinetry to fit this piece of junk!<br /><br />UPDATE: I was able to have this fixed by a local guy.  Apparently there was some bad circuitry that he was able to replace. Glad I don't have to find a new microwave to fit the space, but I still wouldn't recommend it.  Who knows when it will break again.
We bought GE Cafe appliances for our remodel and have had nothing but problems.  Out of 4 separate kitchen appliances, 3 have had problems within 2 to 3 years of ownership.  The GE Cafe microwave suddenly stopped heating and we had to have a repairman come replace the magnetron and diode.  It worked a few weeks but stopped working again.  Then we found out it costs more to repair than to buy a new one.  We traced a workaround to the problem ourselves and found that the microwave works as long as we turn on the stove exhaust fan.  So now, every time we use our microwave, you need to turn on the exhaust fan.  Nice!  Numerous other reviews have complained about the keypad burning out as well, so if you buy, make sure to buy a long term multi-year warranty.  Our GE failures happened shortly after the 1 year warranty expired, and parts/labor for most repairs adds up to the purchase of a new appliance.
We bought all new Samsung appliance for our new home. The microwave and refrigerator have had to be repaired. The microwave started leaking microwaves and burned the inside lip of the unit and on the inside of the door, burning the paint. Samsung replaced the unit after it was seen by an appliance repairman and photos were uploaded to them. My replacement unit just died for no reason. I checked the outlet, breaker and plug - all fine. I have to wait another week before the appliance repairman can come out and tell me I'll have to wait another 2 weeks for a new unit to arrive. Then, I'll have to pay for it to be installed again.
We are currently on the third microwave from LG. The first microwave failed after 2 weeks.  It took 2 weeks for LG to get us a new microwave.  The next microwave lasted 11 months.  It went out on thanksgiving, we bought a 69.00 off brand microwave, it has worked perfectly for last 18 months. The LG failed again after 18 months.  Lowes and Home Depot should replace microwave.  Reading the blog, I have never had a brand of microwave failed this often.  I am going to take LG to court.  They have to know there is a major problem, if so many failures, yet they continued producing this worthless piece of junk.  This appears to be another bean counter situation, cheaper to give new machine and fix damage, than recall product.
We also experienced problems with the paint peeling in this microwave.  It is no longer under warrenty and I was told by GE that this was an isolated incident.  Obviously, that is not the case.  I would not recommend this product especially since GE is unwilling to stand behind their product.
Was great until I opened the door and the microwave inlet cover is (what???) CARDBOARD (???) which I touched and it bent and now am reluctant to use to microwave.  Waiting for Whirlpool to answer my questions about this cardboard affecting my food.  They said not to remove it.  Wondering if anyone has any comments about this.
Was great until 6 months after received. It just stopped working. Trying to contact the manufacture. Will keep you posted on their customer service.
Warning: Stay away from this microwave.  It looks pretty, but it will cost you.  Read the other reviews about its unreliability, GE's poor service, and the expense of repairing this product.  I should have done that before we purchased ours.  If your product is still under the one-year warranty, maybe you have a shot at breaking even.  Ours stopped working just a few months after the 12-month warranty expired.  If you're not under warranty, this is an appliance nightmare, which begins with a $99 service charge so the GE authorized repairman can tell you how much it will actually cost you to repair the microwave (parts and labor).  Not sure how you can ever cost-justify repairing one of these.  Update: GE told us it was not cost effective to repair the unit, but they did offer a $200 rebate toward another GE microwave.  Still can't recommend the unit.
waiting on the call to ge to tell what happened<br /><br />just sad that my 3rd microwave work for about 2 years on average
Very small. You can find better products in the store at lower prices.
Very small and very low power. Takes forever to heat anything up.
Very disappointed, because this is the perfectly shaped microwave for our kitchen. But my husband reported a big, scary electrical storm (and bad smell = burning machine?) inside the unit yesterday, along with a weird dark brown spot on the inside of the machine. He was melting butter in a Pyrex bowl. Today, the microwave is headed for appliance recycling.<br /><br />Importantly, we only used the unit at most once or twice per day, to warm or melt things.
Very disappointed in this product. Completely stopped working after about a year. Everything went out on it, would not even power on.

Update:<br />After 16 months we have the same problem as others. It runs for 3 or 4 seconds and just shuts off.<br /><br />Original Review:<br />I have only owned the microwave for a short time so I can not rate the reliability, not that my individual experience would necessarily be typical.  However, I can rate the features and design of the unit. I like the size, the power and the large turntable.  The controls, however, were poorly designed.  For example, to cook at anything other than full power, you need to press the power level repeatedly. The first press of the button gives you 100% power and each subsequent press reduces the power level by 10%. So, to cook something at 30% power it takes eight presses of the button.
Update: Jan 21, 2012  Just when I thought my experience with Frigidaire could not get any worse, it in fact did.  Having the WARRANTY is worse than not having one.  The Microwave is not working from just around Christmas.  Early January, it should have been fixed.  The Service company called and told me that the parts are not available, so the next possible touch point is Feb 18th.  So, looking at guaranteed no microwave for about 2 months, and even after that there is uncertainty when it would be fixed.  Had I NOT had the Warranty, I would have just taken a loss and gone ahead an purchased another Microwave of a brand called NOT FRIGIDAIRE.  ===========  - This Microwave lasted less than 6 months  - Of course you think all should be fine because it is under warranty.  - Yes, it is under warranty, BUT:    a) you are given the direct contact of a Service Provider, and you are no longer working with Frigidaire directly.    b) So, the buck is passed from Frigidaire over to a third party Appliance Service company    c) The appliance service company guy came, took a look at the Microwave and said they will need to order parts either from their local supplier, or directly from distributor. This could take up to 10 days  So, now you are left hanging without a  Microwave for 10 days or more. With the time off needed to be away from Office to handle the multiple appliance service company appointments, the Warranty is just not worth it.  Also, called Frigidaire customer service.  The Customer Service person was TERRIBLE, and basically told me to deal with it and stop complaining.  NEVER AGAIN WILL I BUY A FRIGIDAIRE PRODUCT.
UPDATE, DECEMBER 2015: I posted this review in January. The microwave stopped working altogether in June 2015. If you find this model anywhere online I advise you DO NOT BUY IT....<br /><br />Full disclosure - I usually make my purchases from Amazon but I had a coupon for 15% off any item at PC Richards (a local store) and was fooled into buying this when it was recommended to me by a salesman. I've owned it for just over 2 years now. Most problems started immediately. I will never buy another GE microwave for this reason, and I'm considering never buying any GE product - anything that takes electricity to run must be made much better for safety reasons, and this is one of the worse electronic appliances I've ever purchased.<br /><br />PROS: none that I know of. No wonder it's discontinued.<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />&#62; Very soon after the warranty ended we started smelling burnt plastic whenever it was used for any length of time, at any power level. The smell lingers and gets into your food.<br /><br />&#62; When cooking anything, a baked potato for example, the moisture from the food gets trapped inside the oven an pours out when you open the door. The walls, floor, and ceiling of the microwave are dripping wet and must be dried after each use unless you want to end up with a muggy mungy moldy mess after a few weeks. And no, the vent is not blocked on the outside. On the inside, maybe, but that would be a defect the consumer cannot see or fix.<br /><br />&#62; Door open button is very flimsy.<br /><br />&#62; Light stays on when you close the door (when you're done) if you are not careful. You must make sure door closes completely - even if it looks closed it might not be and if the lights are on in the kitchen you might not notice the interior light of the microwave is still on - this can make it over heat (I came back hours later and the inside of the oven was very warm) and may blow out the bulb, which normally lasts the lifetime of the oven.<br /><br />&#62; Vents are on the left side, not the top or bottom. This means venting can be difficult if you have something sitting next to it on the left side. See my photo.<br /><br />&#62; All buttons are hard to push, which is not good for those with disability or arthritis.<br /><br />&#62; The clock timer (the one used when not cooking) is tricky to stop - you must read the manual to figure it out because you can't use common sense for this one; manual says you must press timer button and hold for at least 3 seconds to stop this timer.<br /><br />&#62; If you make a mistake when using the cooking timer you can easily add more time to cooking than you planned. For example, I pressed 14 minutes but wanted to change it to 12, so I tried to clear it and thought I did, but when the 12 minutes of cooking time was done it started again on its own for another 14 minutes. There was nothing to warn me this would happen and I could find nothing in the manual that explains it.<br /><br />&#62; No minute button, only 30 second increments.<br /><br />&#62; Turntable moves out of place very easily, like when you place an item on it or remove something from inside the microwave. The groves that hold it in place are shallow so this allows it to move out of place with just a small nudge. Very annoying.<br /><br />&#62; Emails to GE were never answered.62; Vents are on the left side, not the top or bottom.

Unit defective upon arrival, could not be repaired after two attempts and numerous phone calls to Samsung.  Not recommended unless you like wasting your time and not having a microwave for a month after purchase.
Unit arrived looking like a truck had run over it! Ordered again thru one of the big box hardware chains and it also arrived beat to heck. They say third time is a charm. We'll see...
Ugh the headaches.  Purchased 4 years ago and everyone seems to be having the same problems.  Mine was WONDERFUL while it worked.  then after 2 years the dreaded beeping, touchpad operating by itself, started happening.  Luckily I purchased the 5 year warranty.  So out came the repair man...after much hemming and hawing, the door/electronics needed replacement.  $550.00 and it worked again.  Fast forward to 2014, guess what? Yep same problem starts again.  Touchpad not working, beeping, self activating all over again.  So again trusty warranty comes in handy...out comes another repair man...yep hemming and hawing....another $550.00 for new door with electronics.  This time the warranty company calls me...complaining they  just repaired 2 years ago...I explained these are happening to Velos units all over the internet.  They agreed to repair one more time..or refund my purchase price!  Ill have think on it..  Buyer beware
Try a different brand. I bought this in August and it shorted out in February.  It was nice while it lasted but has a dangerous flaw. Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere.
Too many problems for a high end microwave. After 1 year of use, the handle broke. The convection piece of it will not work. Stay away from this product.
This worked fine until it did - which is less than 24 months. Within the duration, the spring lock for the door broke - and now I get the SE error. Which means the unit is toast and I now need to look for a new one. Am not going to buy another Samsung appliance.
This was the Consumer Reports recommended one, and we bought one based on that, only to have it fail within 24 months.  I won't be wasting money on repairing this, and certainly won't be buying a Samsung brand.
This was bought as part of a package of kitchen equipment in May 2013.<br /><br />Currently it hasn't worked for 1/4 of the time I have owned it.<br /><br />As other reviewers have identified there is a known issue where they stop working and don't response at all - Samsung executive customer service refuses to do anything outside the attempt to 'repair it 3 times process'.<br /><br />There is nothing good to say about Samsung, their product, their staff or their agencies - to continue to sell a product that is known to be deficient is negligent<br /><br />I own other Samsung products but because of this I will never buy one again and make sure I can influence others to do likewise.<br /><br />Please don't buy this product - it will most likely fail and you will wish you hadn't...<br /><br />I certainly regret it
This was bought as an emergency replacement for a wonderful Sharp combo oven.  The convection circulating fan had failed, and there was no time to have it repaired.  The fan motor simply needed to be replaced.  The microwave function still worked perfectly, but I needed the convection oven for holiday baking.  It was just before Thanksgiving and I couldn't find a replacement of the the Sharp locally, and no time for an on-line order.<br /><br />I found this Samsung locally, and it looked like it would fill the bill.  It did save me from holiday disaster, but I've been far from pleased with it.  You have to memorize ridiculous sequences of the controls that offer you only numbers as feedback so the manual near at hand is essential.  It will only accept two entries for sequence cooking; I used three much of the time in the Sharp for extraordinary results cooking rice and polenta.  Now I have to enter the first two stages, then the third after the first two are finished.<br /><br />The temperature of the convection mode is incredibly erratic; I set 200 degrees and when I checked the oven temperature during cooking it was at 350.  Today I set it at 400 (the maximum) and it never got above 350.  I think the control circuit board is failing because I looked at the clock when it was 6:12 and the oven clock read 10:something.  I reset the clock, then looked at it this evening at around 8:30 and it read 1:something.<br /><br />The only good thing about the appliance is that the beeper can be shut off.  (I hate those electronic beeps.)  As far as I'm concerned Samsung should stick to making phones and not try to produce products they don't have enough concern about to do well.  I will avoid the brand for appliances.
This was a reeplacement purchase.  Our previous unit had no issues and was locally purchased.  The door was accidentally damaged and could not be easily repaired.  Needed exact replacement for previously purchased trim kit although product reviews concerning.  Within 2 weeks the electronic key board routinely malfunctioned.  Often requires multiple attempts to start.  contacted seller who defered back to GE.  Not the kind of service I expected nor previously experienced with an amazon vendor.  My recommendation is to avoid both (vendor and product)if possible.
This thing broke down in the same manner as all the other reviewers described. Samsung should be ashamed, this is a pretty obvious design flaw. I will be staying away from ALL samsung products from now on.
This review is as much for this product as is for Consumer Reports. Bought all new appliances for a new cabin we built and used Consumer Reports recommendation to buy these appliances. This was one these purchases and was given an excellent review by the Consumer Reports people!!!<br /><br />Lasted just over a year and quit working. GE wants $75 just to look at it before telling me how much in parts and labor they will charge me to repair it. I can buy another company's 2.2 Cu. Ft. Stainless Steel Countertop Microwave for $89 today brand new with full warranty! Ah...no thanks!<br /><br />My old 29 year old Panasonic is still working great and heats food just as well as this one if not better. I think I'll take my own advice now instead of Consumer Reports and buy another Panasonic!<br /><br />UPDATE: Found out the inverter board is bad...GE wants $250 for a new part + $75 service trip charge and another $75 for repair = $400 total repair cost for a microwave oven just over a year old when one of these brand new is just under $300!!!
This product sucks ass when I received it doesn't work and have tryed and tryed to exchange it but whirlpool does not and will not stand behind there products
This product initially worked very well.  Within a few months, we found that the microwave would come on all by itself.  It totally quite working in about 1.5 years.  I have read many complaints just like this one.  It should have been recalled by the manufacturer.  I will never buy this brand again.
This oven made it about a year before the interior paint started peeling off.  Customer service was not helpful.  This oven cost us at least twice what comparable ovens cost.  We bought it because it fit the space we had available.  Never again.
This model performed as to be expected... it adequately heated items. After just over one year it suddenly suffered a short and started starting by itself. Additionally, the control pad stopped working. We temporarily overcame the problem by leaving the unit unplugged until needed and it then only sometimes functioned. Perhaps the old adage is correct in you get what you pay for.
This microwave worked fine while it lasted, about 2 years.  It looks fine and wasn't too loud when the fan was on, but the fact that it didn't last any longer makes the features irrelevant.  The price certainly was no better than comparable microwaves with much better longevity.  I would not recommend this product.
This microwave worked fine for some 3 months and then started problem with door. I was totally disappointed seeing problem in just 3 months. Customer service was rude and unhelpful.
This microwave was very hard to install, and I am pretty handy. Within a month the numbers stopped lighting up and some of the touch buttons (such as defrost button) stopped working. Within another month the push button door latch stopped functioning and we had to take it off, now we have to use a screwdriver to pop the door open. The stainless steel started to turn brownish and doesn't come off. Recently the lights started turning on by themselves and today was the last straw when the fan came on by itself and wouldn't turn off. That is why I am on here looking for a new one. Save yourself a major headache and don't buy it!!
This microwave was selected during a KB HOME build for our new home over 2 years ago (Summer 2010).  The microwave indicated that it was manufactured in April 2010.  Low and behold the microwave would start shutting down by itself when I hit start beginning about June 2012.  A few days ago it just stopped working completely.  No pop, no fizzle, no crackle - it just wouldn't heat up anything.  Whirlpool dispatched a 3rd-party repair person and he stated that the magnetron was bad (or dead?).  He was fairly certain it was a recall item.  The repair person estimated that, absent a recall, it would cost $450 to fix. The service appointment itself was $89.  The following day, the repair service left a voice-mail stating that it was not a recall item, but that I should verify it with Whirlpool .<br /><br />I contacted Whirlpool (1-800-253-1301) and the customer service rep stated that it wasn't their problem once the standard 12-month warranty had elapsed.  The rep said there was no recall for the magnetron.  I escalated the matter to a supervisor.  All the supervisor did was reiterate that Whirlpool wasn't going to do anything past the 12-months.  The supervisor then offered to sell me one of four new microwaves at a VIP rate.  Of course the rate was not VIP at all once you added the deliver ($70) and the installation ($45) charges (so for being screwed over, I was a VIP?).  It goes without saying that I didn't take her up on the offer(s).<br /><br />Needless to say, I was very upset and immediately Google'd the model number in the hope of finding out more info on the problem and perhaps locating a cheaper replacement for the microwave.  And that, my friends, is how I ended up here on Amazon and saw that 29 other reviewers before me also had issues with this particular microwave.  I got a certified lemon.<br /><br />What are my options at this point?  A class action lawsuit?  A complaint to the state Attorney General's office? I don't know. What I do know is that Whirlpool is aware of the problem and could not care less.  I'm out of $600 (or more) and  I'm left reheating stuff in the oven now.<br /><br />DO NOT BUY THIS MICROWAVE.
This microwave was purchased in 9/2013.  As of 11/2014 the unit no longer heats food and needs to be replaced.  We bought a Samsung dishwasher at the same time and it gives us trouble also.  I will never buy another Samsung product.
This microwave was pre installed by KB HOME when I purchased the house. It came with extended warranty for 18 months and the microwave died just after 20 month of use. I don't know how whirlpool manage to tune this microwave just to work for the warranty period.<br /><br />Anyway now I end up with an expensive exhaust :(<br /><br />Take it from all the reviewers here !!! DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT !!!
This microwave was new to my home when I moved in. After 18 months, the door switch broke: Which meant that any time the door was shut, the microwave spontaneously turned itself on (and didn't turn off until the door was opened). Fortunately, this occurred while we were home -- otherwise the microwave might have started a huge fire from continuously running empty! Because  it was out of warranty, Frigidaire customer service was ridiculously unhelpful; the representative told me that I would have to pay $150.00 just to send someone out to confirm what the problem was, and then pay for additional parts and labor to fix it! Instead I ditched the piece of garbage and bought a Samsung. I would NEVER buy a Frigidaire product again. P.S. I also had a similar experience with my two year-old Frigidaire gas range, where the glass oven door spontaneously shattered while sitting idle. Run fast and far from Frigidaire.
This microwave was installed by the builder in our new home. 2 years, 1 month later and it's totally died. Suddenly quit while cooking, odd smell so we killed the power to the unit. Sharp was zero help. Representatives gave indications that it was a safety issue and perhaps something could be done but they stuck to their guns about it being out of warranty. Repairman blamed the motor board? That repair lasted not even a year - same thing happened - burning smell, quit working. New repair company same fix. 8 months later the unit picks and chooses when it decided to work. Door pops open when you push start, buttons won't work. Closes then opens again. It's ridiculous. Loved the concept and &#34;seemed&#34; to work fine  for a year or but it is totally ridiculous that a microwave of this price range doesn't last. Our next door neighbor has the same microwave and their's broke within the first year, they too are now having issues again. Hoping the repairman can fix it as doesn't seem like there are many alternatives out there to get something similar that don't have parts made by Sharp. Update, 3 years in our new home and on our 4th repair of this microwave. Buyer beware.
This microwave was installed by our builder in our new home a year and a half ago.  I'm not sure why, as I have since found out that the service technician for this area has been out numerous times to replace these microwaves.  Ours died after 17 months of regular use.  It will run but will not heat anything.  I called Whirlpool to troubleshoot this, and all they did was put me through an automated call that set up a service appointment.  At no point did they tell me what this service call would cost.  So I had to call back and get a customer service rep who told me it would be $129 for someone to come out to my home.  That of course does not include any parts or replacement.  I can buy a brand new microwave that works from a better company for twice that.  Why would I fix a microwave that broke in a little over a year of use.  In all my years of microwave use, I have never had a microwave break.  It's pretty ridiculous to me to have it break in a little over a year, especially when my neighbor had hers break two months prior.  I would never buy a Whirlpool appliance again.
This microwave SUCKS and so does the seller!!!! I purchased this microwave in April because I was remodeling my kitchen and was upgrading to this better quality stainless steel over the range microwave.  Well how I said I purchased it in April, but didn't install it until the beginning of August.  The delivery was fast, but when I reccieved it, two of the back corners were dented, but I decided to install it anyways because it was in the back anyways and nobody would ever see it.  It is now October and it has gone out on me.  I was about to warm up my dinner when I pressed start and BOOM it went out.  It turned off just like that.  It never turned back on. I am really dissapointed becasue I thought I had purchased a good quality product.  I contacted the seller and he said to call Samsung and they would cover it since its still under warranty.  Well it is under warranty, but the thing is it turns out this is a refurbished unit when the seller says he purchased it new from Lowes.  He's a liar becasue Lowes does NOT sell refurbished units.  So now I'm out a couple hundred $$$ and now I have to purchase a new one.  People please listen to the reviews and don't buy this microwave, whether it's her or some other place.  Save yourselves time, money, and dissapointment.  Also, do NOT buy from this seller he is sooo unproffesional and NOT helpfull. I only give it one star because I have to give it a 1-5 or else I would give it a 0.
This microwave stopped working 364 days after we bought the house. Unfortunately it was the Firday before a holiday weeked and I was not able to contact Whrilpool until the following week. Whrilpool refused to honor the warranty when I called becasue it was two day expired.   A service repair man then came to the house to diagnose the problem. He told me the the microwave needed an new magnetron and control board. However, he said me that I should just get a different microwave. If I replaced the parts in this microwave he would probably be back in another year becuase Whrilpool had so many problems with this model. After that recommendation I looked at reviews on the Whrilpool web sight and Amazon, defective magnetrons seem to be a problem with this unit.   I would not recommend purchasing this unit since it seems that there is a problem with functionality and their warranty department is unwilling to budge on anything.
This microwave is now two years old and the door has too much play in it. It is loose and jiggles. The repairman can't fix it. It appears it needs a spacer of some sort. I would not recommend this product for that reason. If the door starts to do this, you have to get a new microwave.
This microwave is garbage.  We have had many problems with it, fought with the warrenty center, they finally replaced it and it is not working again. Microwave ovens should last longer than just a couple years.  Whirlpool you need to do something about this.  You know this isnt just a random problem.  You have produced a inferior product and you need to do something about it.  This microwave costs $1000.00.  This isnt a walmart throw away item.  YOU NEED TO RECALL THIS ITEM!
This microwave has more features than ANY other on the market...and aesthetically it is a work of art!  When it works, it is fabulous, unfortunately that just isn't often enough.  We had this microwave for @ 3陆 years and if we were lucky, we got 2陆 years of use our of it.  Sadly, the sophistication of this appliance seems to be its Achilles heel.  There are so many feature to break and they do!    I could accept the fact that our unit was a lemon, however this was the second unit I purchased...the first died in two days and it was decided that the retailer would just take it back.  Also, a good friend of ours purchased the same model and has had numerous issues of their own...with their door components (LCD panel, etc) replaced multiple times.    We love the microwave, but just can't handle the constant breakdowns and huge delays in repair...typically down for a month due to delays in service calls, all parts having to be ordered, then waiting for tech to come back...and in many cases, waiting for them to order more parts. When the unit is down, not only don't you have a microwave, you don't have an exhaust fan, so there's an impact to all of your cooking!    Below is a recap (of the items I could remember) of our Whirlpool adventure:    Microwave Purchased - 9/7/07  Warranty Issues:  6/23/08 - Glass turntable shattered when sizzle pan was heating, LCD display issues  7/1/08 -- Service Call - Parts ordered  7/17/08 - Replaced several parts, issue not resolved - Parts ordered  8/11/08 - Replaced several parts, issue not resolved - Parts ordered  8/18/08 - Replaced several parts, issue not resolved - Parts ordered  9/4/08 - Replaced 17 parts - Issue resolved    Extended (3rd party) Warranty:  1/29/2009 - No display on LCD, unit non-functional  2/?/2009 - Replaced Control board, connector  12/14/2009 - Magnetron not heating/cooling fan not running.  Tech was onsite for approx 5 min, did little/no testing and decided to order AC Filter board (along with previously broken plastic components from earlier repairs)  12/24/2009 - Tech determined incorrect part (AC filter board) ordered, so placed order for 19 additional parts and left with no further action.  1/7/2010 - Replaced 19 parts - didn't fix original issue (Magnetron not heating/cooling fan not running) and caused a new issue - exhaust fan not functioning - this was a 6 hour service call.  Six additional parts ordered - microwave left in pieces and not re-installed on wall.  1/14/10 - Tech replaced 6 additional parts (3 hr call), (LCD control board, upper front plastic frame, magnetron cooling fan, wiring harnesses).  Issue with exhaust fan was determined to be bad new relay control board (replaced on last call).  Tech installed original board (which had a visible burn mark on it and unit worked.  Tech order new relay control board.  - Unit worked when tech's left, however by the end of the day, the display was flashing and non-functional.   1/20/10 - Control board arrived and installed and the exhaust fan did not work, and issue with the LCD was not resolved.  Re-installed original relay control board and exhaust fan worked, LCD issue still occuring.  1/21/10 - Tech attempted to address issues and after having signifigant problems, escalated to advance support.  It ws determined that the unit was not repairable.  2/5/10 - 3rd party warranty company issued a check for the full purchase price of the unit.
This microwave has had one problem after another since it was installed close to a year ago. It's prone to all sorts of computer malfunctions. Let's see if I can even remember them all. We've had it start up again after pulling food out and closing the door (without hitting start again). It's often (50+ times) sounded as if it was working, but when I realized it had been an awfully long time without it chiming, I found that it had frozen just a few seconds into the heating. The most disturbing problem was that it has on perhaps five occasions turned on on its own--with no one in the room. There have been many occasions where it has just not worked at all. When this happened, unplugging it and plugging it back in used to reset it so that it would work. Unfortunately, it now won't work at all, with just the code, SE flashing on its display.<br /><br />We're buying a new microwave this weekend, and I can guarantee it won't be a Samsung.
This microwave has every button in the world except a simple timer. We used our microwave timer for everything. It's so stupid that a microwave this expensive doesn't include a basic kitchen timer.
This microwave has broken twice in the past two years. First was a transformer that I replaced. Now the item sparks like crazy. Would not recommend.
This microwave cooks well and looks ok.....  The problem is the stupid beeper that won't quit beeping until you open the door!! There isn't a way to turn this annoying feature off either.  If you want peace and quiet look elsewhere.  But, if you like high pitch annoying sounds this is the microwave for you.
This microwave came with the house I purchased 6 months ago. Manufacture date is Nov 2013. It stopped working for no reason. No error message. Outlet still works. Samsung customer support has been terrible. This is not the first time I have a problem with samsung appliances. Only thing they seem to do right are TV's. I recommend buying a different microwave.
This microwave came with our new house.  It started making noises and is now smoking. What happened to microwaves that last??
This microwave  is a piece of garbage. We ordered it from another online website. It arrived defective and sharp refused to replace it. We had to go through 4 repair appointments  before they agreed to send a new one. We have to pay to have the replacement  installed. Sharp customer service it terrible. Dodging phone calls. We should have bought something else from amazon...lesson learned!
This may or may not be a solution for you but it worked for me.<br />My SMH8165ST was purchased in January of 2012. In March of 2014 it started having the SE errors and similar to others on this site, would start on its own, night light would go off and on on its own, beep every 15 minutes, etc.<br />I tried all of the YouTube and other suggestions with removing the circuit board, cleaning all the connections. Originally this worked for two weeks, and then the problems restarted. Kept on repeating the process for the next 2 陆 months with the time interval getting shorter and shorter between cleanings.<br />The last time I left the power on when reinstalling the panel and the system worked fine. Oops, forgot to reinstall the circuit board mounting bracket.<br />Reinstalled the panel with the mounting bracket, again with live power and the SE error came on instantly.<br />Repeated the process three times, no errors without the circuit board mounting bracket; SE errors with the Circuit board mounting bracket.<br />With a large magnifying glass, I discovered a very, very small scratch on the ribbon cable between the circuit board and the control panel. This scratch lines up with a very sharp edge on the circuit board mounting bracket and it seemed that through vibration and general use; the ribbon cable was starting the have a direct contact between the embedded wires in the ribbon cable and the sharp edge of the mounting bracket, more than likely causing the strange SE errors.<br />I covered the sharp edge on the mounting bracket with electrician鈥檚 tape, as well as the ribbon cable where it bent around the mounting bracket projection.<br />Then while reinstalling the panel with live power, I tried twisting the panel, hitting it against the edge of the microwave, jiggling all the wires and all sorts of moves to see if the SE error would show up. No errors showed up.<br />The microwave has been working perfectly for two months now. It my case it is most likely that the manufacturing process was at fault for installing the ribbon cable tight against a sharp edge of the circuit board mounting bracket.<br />I would give this microwave 4 stars if it wasn't for the poor quality control during manufacturing.e manufacturing process was at fault for installing the ribbon cable tight against a sharp edge of the circuit board mounting bracket.<br />I would give this microwave 4 stars if it wasn't for the poor quality control during manufacturing.
This machine's finish quality was off out of the box.  The door didn't quite line up with it's case when closed and there were a couple small dents on the lower left of the door as well.    These were tolerable, however, as long as the machine worked - and it did... sometimes.    For example, from the start this machine would occasionally shut off mid-cooking, as in the timer would go blank, the light would go out, and the food would still be pretty cold.      Other times the food would seem to be heating up pretty well but then the machine would shut off.  On those occasions we thought it might have quit because it was getting too much steam on its sensors (wherever they might have been) so we would wrap foods extremely tightly with plastic wrap - still to no avail.      On still other occasions the food **looked** like it was being cooked (light stayed on, the table rotated, the timer counted down, and tone sounded at the end) but then it would turn out to be only ever so slightly warmer than when originally put in.    After a year of our just making do with this machine's cranky behavior and then just planning our meals without microwave use it died altogether.    My wife and I can only say, Good riddance! in response.    Consumer Reports lists this microwave as a best buy and, honestly, that's why I bought it in the first place.  Unfortunately, this machine is far, far, far from being a good buy much less a Best Buy!!!  Based on my experience and those of the others who wrote in here I won't be touching a GE microwave for years, if then.
This item dod not work from the second i opened the nox
This is the worst microwave I have ever owned.  It takes twice as long to heat food.  We also have owned it for only a few months and the key pad broke.
This is the SECOND one of these that has blown up on me in 8 months. I don't recommend it at all.
This is the second microwave and just like the first one it lasted less then a year. The magnetron fried, we bought a new one, it fried again, we fixed it and it happened a 3rd time. I will not buy another whirlpool product!
This is by far the MOST stupid appliance I have ever come across in all my years.  As you will read in other reviews, the absurdity of its functions has yet to cease angering me on a daily basis.<br /><br />The 3 beeps when things are done cooking - You can not do ANYTHING until it slowly finishes its 3 beeps.  No stop, no cancel, no starting the microwave again or adding time.  You must stand there and listen to its siren song of idiocy.<br /><br />Also, you can't use the timer and use the microwave at the same time. I mean, why?! WTF!<br /><br />Daily I want to rip this thing off the wall and take it into a field Office Space style and beat it with a baseball bat.<br /><br />Anyone want to buy a microwave from me? Cheap!
This is built to break.  I have a 5 yr warranty from the dealer, which is fortunate because I am now on my third repair or replace process in 18 months.  For me it has consistently been the essential part of the microwave-the magnetron-which makes it heat!  update Oct 2015:  I bought this in Feb 2013 and the magnetron issue has happened once again, and I don't even use it a lot for actual cooking.   I can get it repaired or replaced because of the warranty, but it is tiresome to go through this so frequently.   The GE model I purchased previously lasted 12 years.  Has a commitment to quality dropped so drastically?  And Bosch is alleged to be one of the better brands.     Buyer Beware!
This is an absolute crappy microwave. I'm thankful I didn't spend a dime on it since it was a Christmas Present. The entire appliance is shoddy. After using it for about a year, the door handle began to show cracks and eventually just cracked completely which compromised the glass panel on the front door. Eventually the entire circuit board shorted out when I was simply changing the light bulb. My husband and I did not misuse this appliance and we certainly  weren't &#34; hard&#34; on it. It's simply a poorly made appliance.
This is a terrible product and brand. We have had the microwave less than two years and it is now worthless. The turntable will not turn and the unit will not heat things up. Called LG and they refused to give any help or assistants.
This has to be the worst microwave I have ever purchased. It arrived without the internal clock, it is completely missing, so obviously it didn't function out of the box. And I can't get a replacement for another week, this is awful. I know microwaves are just a convenience but having just moved we don't have one and this was timed to arrive just in time for our new home. Total disappointment in both the product and Amazon.
THIS GIVES OFF A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF HEAT ON THE LEFT SIDE AND THE BACK.  Simply touching the left side casually after it completed a fast heat cycle left a burn on my forearm.  I then felt around the unit without touching and found the right side cool the top reasonably so and the back burning with heat.  Since this is a countertop unit and the side will be exposed in most applications my experience is that this unit is dangerous!  Especially if you have children.  I am returning it immediately.
This came with the townhouse I bought in May 2013. It is now Jan. 2014 and it's dead. The date of manufacture is July 2011. Came on here to buy another and read all the reviews....THANK you ...now I know to replace it with a different brand. It's not even 2 years old. Unfortunately, the previous owners bought the whole shebang so I own the same brand/model oven, fridge and dishwasher...AHHHHH....that doesn't bode well for me, does it? Hopefully the microwave is the worst of them and I'll get more use out of the rest of them. Frigidaire is an Electrolux company. Thanks again for the reviews.<br />Beth
This  appliance has more problems than perks!  I purchased an extended warranty and later found out it is worthless.  My daughter open the door  and the bottom of the handle broke.  A few nights later the control panel went haywire!!  It beeps and flashes different functions and dates until you unplug it. There is nothing convenient about plugging and unplugging an appliance every time you want to use it. Light-bulbs ( it takes two) costs $6-$7 dollars each and blows out within 24 hours. It seems as if the appliance is experiences a power serge.  (The constant flickering of the lights is very irritating and unsettling.  I would have been better off purchasing a microwave from Walmart.....at least they have a legitimate warranty.
These reviews don't lie. Samsung makes large expensive paper weights. After 1 year and 10 months we too received the 5E or SE error code. Now that it is out of warranty it will be an expensive fix. Pure Garbage. Samsung has the worst customer service. Apparently the error code has to do with a faulty keypad. If you search the error code it says that the steam and heat cause corrosion on the connectors on the keypad board. It is meant to go above stove that creates steam. Samsung needs to make it right and they refuse too. Look at all the poor reviews for this appliance. Shame on Samsung. Never again and that includes all your products.
There is definitely a manufacturing flaw with this microwave that Whirlpool refuses to admit! When this microwave was under warranty in the first year, we had if fixed FOUR times for the same problem. Luckily we didn't have to pay for those repairs because the warranty covered it. While it was still under warranty, we tried to talk to the company and let them know about the four repairs for the SAME thing noting that it must be a problem with how the product was made. All they did was try to get us to buy the extended warranty.<br /><br />So, 8 months after we bought this $500 microwave, we had to buy a new one! I truly believe that Whirlpool knows there is a defect with this microwave but refuses to stand behind their product.
The unit burst into flames at the rear, right  shelf support, after 18 months of service.  I was warming a cup of coffee.<br />Stay safe and don't buy this item.
The oven comes with my new Standard Pacific Home.<br />It performs OK and it is definitely not stainless steel. It's just plastic panel with stainless coated.<br />On the second week of use, the plastic film on the door control button has small bubble patches. We thought it just protective film but it is not. The bubbles kept surfacing and broke after another week of use. I called customer service and they told me it's just a cosmetic issues. They just document it and they are not going to repair or replace it. No more Whirlpool for me.
The oven  stopped working  1 month after I got it, Samsung is unhelpful, a repair guy came said he fixed it. It is still not working,<br />I have been chasing Samsung for 2 weeks.
The only thing it did was cover the spots .  When I turned the microwave on it sparked.  I had waited 24 hours.  It is a GE mstainless on the out side.  Wasn't cheap and was a gift.  Suck it up and buy a new one.
the microwave turntable and light would come by itself and sometimes when you closed the door.  At first we were able to cook with the microwave but eventually it got to where I couldn't get it to cook no matter what we tried such as unplugging it and it would sit there rotating but not heating.  So sadly we had to send it back.  I only got to use the grill feature once and it was fun.
The microwave is sparking while heating we are sending it back for a replacement will hope it works this time
The handle is attached to the door by two weak screws that bear up against a nonmetallic surface on the door. For my unit, the lower attachment door surface broke within six months and the handle pulled away from the door.<br />I am having a service call take care of it but it looks like a design flaw. Even if I get a replacement door, I expect it will break again in six months. Avoid this model design.<br />Updated Dec 2016: Yes the replacement door also is showing the same problem.<br />Worse: The magnetron failed as soon as the one year warranty was up. Would not heat food. We had a service call and replaced it.<br />It has failed again in 9 months. LG wants more for a service call than the new microwave cost.<br />I would avoid LG microwaves completely. I still have a countertop Panasonic microwave working perfectly after 15 years - unfortunately LG does not know microwaves :)
The first of these we bought didn't work right out of the box. We returned it for another, which managed to work for just over 2 months and now won't heat anything. Very disappointed.
The door near the bottom handle mount suddenly cracked, causing the handle to fall off, and the front glass panel to slide down. Wow, this is the first time I've seen a microwave oven break like this, especially an expensive high end unit like this one! It appears to be a design flaw: The door hook springs feel unusually strong, resulting in some unnecessary stress on the door when closing. Still, this seems like a really silly thing for a high-end microwave oven.<br /><br />I recommend you avoid this.
The cord isn't long enough, so I have to pay more money for a longer cord.
The clock runs fast, gaining about 5 minutes ever day. It also heats very unevenly. We've owned it for a month. I'm looking forward to the total breakdown described on the rest of these reviews so that I can get a new one.
The button to open the microwave door is too tight. You need both hands to open the door. If I'm not too lazy, I would return it.
Terrible. Had for 2 years and the curcuit board went. Causes power surges. Need to replace instead of repair.
Terrible product. Cheaply made. Horrible review all around.
Terrible product, broke down after one month of light use..
Terrible microwave. doesn't heat the food yet the outside of the microwave gets hot. never had a microwave that gets hot on the outside. working with the supplier to replace it.
stopped working after 3 months.  total junk.
Stay away!  Bad product.  Expensive repairs. Poor support.<br /><br />I have owned 3 of these. All white not stainless.  I talked a friend into buying a stainless one ( he bought110v - bad move... underpowered ) I love the concept.  But at this point I'd strongly recommend  you stay away from this product.  I'm talking about the 220v Advantium oven.  My experience:<br />I had the house rewired to put this 220v oven above the stove.<br />  The first one I owned lasted about 1 1/2 years, then the bottom heating element (a halogen bulb) burnt out.  I had service replace it.  About 1/2 a year later the controller for the microwave burnt out.  When it worked, it worked great. So, I replaced the whole unit.<br />  The second one was exactly the same design: 220v with halogen bulb lower heating element.  After about 2 years, the halogen bulb again burnt out.  Again after another year, the whole unit broke to the point I again replaced it.<br />  So, I really liked the concept, but obviously the design engineering was bad.  This was severely pointed out in the 3rd 220v unit I bought:  They changed the design!  They replaced the lower halogen heating element with an infrared heating element.  Halogen bulbs are near instant on.  Infrared takes time to heat up.  So, frozen 12&#34; pizza took a bit longer to cook, and all the recipes that relied on bottom heat was off a bit... seemed like they changed the heater characteristics without bothering to reprogram the recipes, but Ok.  I still liked the concept.<br />  Then, the lower now infrared heater failed.  So I called service. They replaced the part.  But now... it wouldn't  even cook a pizza.  Too little power from the lower heating unit.  Service came out to fix it again.  Then, I cooked a pizza in front of the technician that replaced the bulb. The &#34;cooked&#34; pizza came out burnt on the top, and the bottom uncooked: &#34;floppy slices&#34;.  The product after repair, no longer performed it's function.  I had many calls into GE consumer relations.  No help.  At the end, I was told the fixed product worked as designed, and there was nothing more they would do on this unit.  They were willing to sell me a 4th one.  When I asked how it would cook, he didn't know.<br /><br />Love the concept, but bad execution, and expensive and poor support.
Started making a buzzing / arcing sound this morning.  Opened door, smelled burning electronics, unplugged for 30 minutes, tried again with nothing inside, same result.  Dead, going to recycling.  Getting a Panasonic Commercial Grade microwave instead - all residential microwaves seem to have reliability issues.
SO DISAPPOINTED!! Bought this July 2013 and our kitchen was not ready yet, so we didn't put it in until a few months ago and it worked fine- we probably used it only couple dozen times and my husband went to warm up our daughters food Wednesday and NOTHING! Completely &#34;dead&#34;! Will not turn on, no buttons works, etc.<br /><br />This is extremely disappointing and our warranty was up July 2014!!<br /><br />This is why you do not spend $800 on a microwave and I will NEVER purchase a SHARP product ever again!!!!!!<br /><br />Totally sad and disappointed.
Similar to many other reviewers, we were happy with our purchase until the SE error appeared. The microwave lasted for 3 years without a problem, but suddenly tonight while using the stove, the microwave gave the error message. We tried to troubleshoot the problem, but nothing worked.<br /><br />I called Samsung to report the problem, and they are sending out someone to repair the control panel free of charge. Because of the negative reviews, they do have a special warranty on this part of the unit since it is such a common problem. Despite their helpful customer service, I would not purchase this Samsung microwave unless you eventually want to have to replace a faulty control panel.
Samsung might make tons of nice product but Oven range Microwave is not one of them. Seems like 5E or SE code seems to be the common problem with their microwave.<br />My warranty was just about to run out and I've been getting this code. I should have doing research before I went with them. Live and learn I suppose.
Same story as the others here. Poor product, poor service. The dreaded -se- code after 20 months.  Debating smashing it on YouTube once I get a new microwave. Don't buy this rubbish!
Same as the other one star reviews. Less than 2 years, panel fried for no reason (overnight, we werent even using it at the time!) Not under warranty and almost $200 to fix a $800 appliance. Fifty dollar microwaves last way longer than this! We are paying to fix, but if it haopens again, we will just put a regular microwave in that space.
Same as every one else..this microwave is three years old ..broke twice ! They know they have an SE problem and continue to sell their junk!  Same as everyone else they want you to pay to fix it...told us last time we got it fixed they resolved the problem...well broke again SE AGAIN ..so I will never buy from them again...I will tell everyone I know not to buy their junk ..is it really worth it to screw people over like that?
Received this microwave.  The first time we tried to use it the top and the sides got extremely hot and it shut off .  It now has no power at all.  I will be returning this and not purchasing a new one.
Received it and installed it. The fan went on and the fan blew but it did not heat.  It took me two months to finally get a repair person to come out but he guessed and ordered the wrong part (magnitron). It turned out to be something else, I can't remember what, so they have to order that. I am still waiting.  Fortunately my old microwave (Amana) still works out in the garage or I would be really frustrated. The repair person told me that GE has the most problems even though all the brands use the same components, from Korea.  Must be something about the GE specs together that blows things up.  I'll be staying clear of GE products from now on.
RECALL NEEDED - THIS PROBLEM HAS EXISTED FOR OVER 8 YEARS IN THE SAME MODEL MICROWAVE FROM G.E. IT IS NOT SAFE. ONCE THE WHITE COATING PEELS AWAY AND METAL IS EXPOSED THE UNIT WILL SPARK AND CAN CAUSE A KITCHEN FIRE.    The white coating is bubbling and peeling off of the inner top surface of my microwave. It was manufactured in March 2011 and installed in June 2011. Just over a year ago. The current unit was a replacement for the exact same built-in unit that also was just over a year old and experiencing the same problem. If you purchase one of these units, be sure to purchase an extended warranty.    If you read the comments at the GE community forum you will see that this problem has existed for years. Same product, same model number, same problem over and over. But GE has done nothing to correct it. Read the details at this link:  [...]    Although, it is a useful unit otherwise - lots of great features. But once the coating starts bubbling and peeling you cannot safely use it. Total hazard. Additionally, unless this unit is installed over a range users are probably operating the unit without knowing it is in an unsafe condition because they cannot see the coating peeling away on the top inner surface.    WHY HAS GE NOT RECALLED THIS PRODUCT?
Purchased this microwave from Lowes in August 2011.  The microwave stopped heating four days ago...fifteen months from installation to failure.  Contacted Samsung for repair service, and was directed to an authorized service provider in my area who qouted me a $95 charge just to come to the house...parts and labor would be additional.  What's interesting is that the microwave didn't last long enough for me to experience the SE code problem that virtually everyone else has mentioned.  So, do I pay to have the unit repaired only to then have the SE code problem pop-up, or do I just go get a different oven???  Hmmmm...I think I'll get a new oven...and not a Samsung.
Product just isn't built to last, when buying these types of appliances best to get something you can unplug and replace.  This product and company just do not hold up...Equipment brand new 5/27/13, installed Aug/13 stopped working 15 months later.
poorly built
Please, please do not buy this microwave. After just a few months it stopped heating intermittently. Then it started tripping our breaker. It only does this occasionally. I have had Samsung repair personnel out twice and they can't fix it. They now say I must have a faulty breaker. Well, we had a Kenmore microwave in the same exact spot for 9 years and it never once tripped the breaker. They have no explanation as to why it doesn't heat. They haven't fixed it, I'm worried the electrical system is faulty, and therefore a fire hazard and Samsung refuses to replace it.  The problems occur sporadically and as a repairman hasn't actually seen it malfunction they don't believe me. Do not buy this OR ANY SAMSUNG PRODUCT!!<br />The total lack of concern for their customer is shocking. My husband and I spent an hour and a half on the phone with some lackey from customer service named Landry H. and all he did was spend the entire time telling us he couldn't help us unless we agreed to a THIRD service call to see if they could catch it not working. He refused to transfer us to anyone else, or offer us any alternatives, no matter how many different things we suggested.  I will never buy a SAMSUNG product again, and to anyone reading this review, for your own sanity.....RUN.
PLEASE read the reviews, it could save you time, money and frustration.  I also bought a GE Microwave - Cafe thought it would be a quality product because I paid over $400.00, it also started dying after the first year, the magnatron, which has a five-year warrenty was corroded and had to be replaced at an additional $$ repair cost, part was free.  One day after the 30 day repair warrenty the microwave  totally died -$800 +.  Repair failed to come during appointed time, in fairness they later said they had called and rescheduled, but I had no message on my phone so I waited for 4 hours.  The manager I spoke to was willing to have me wait another five hours on another day, that's the best they could do.  So if you want to throw your money away and get poor service, definitely buy GE products!
Piece of junk. Got two years of use and it died. Customer service says too bad. Whirlpool dishwasher died a few months ago. Whirlpool is dead to me.
Paid an obscene amount of money for a 24&#34; Sharp microwave drawer. It was great for the 23 months that it worked. Died suddenly a few weeks ago (purchased February 2013). When it blew a fuse and then died I called appliance place where I had purchased it. I was told that I had to call Sharp directly. I did so. Spent 30 minutes on the phone telling my story to 4 very nice people at Sharp. They said that they would review my case and call me back in a few days. They called and said that someone from a local appliance place would come and look at it. Service men came, diagnosed the problem - something just blew up - and I was told that I would have to wait to here from Sharp. Local service person called back (very nice person) and he told me that Sharp would pay for the diagnostic visit only. If I chose to repair it, it would cost $180. I called Sharp - &#34;sorry, warranty over.&#34; We paid $900 for a microwave that lasted less than 2 years. That is what we get for spending so much money on a microwave!
Our LG LMV1683ST just caught fire too.<br />Making popcorn like we have countless times before, happened to walk past and noticed flames coming from the roof vent.<br />Luckily we caught it early so were able to put out the flames without too much drama.<br />I called LG and the earliest they can get someone out is next Monday (today is Tuesday).  Actually, I was surprised that the customer service rep didn't express any concern whatsoever about us having a fire in our kitchen, no big deal I guess!<br />And, I have to add that it is vented correctly, I double checked that.  Installed above the stove and room vented.<br />We purchased ours May 2013, it's now March 2014 so it had better still be under warranty.  To be honest, I'm now very uneasy at the thought of getting another one of these, I'd never trust it again.  Thats something I'll be talking to them about after the service tech comes out.<br /><br />Note Added 16/3/14:  I also reviewed microwave on Lowes.com last week but it was not published. Presumably they delete any negative reviews.  Will never trust that site again, after all, it was the positive reviews on that site that made me buy the thing in the first place.<br /><br />Update 17/3/14:  Service Tech came out and said it was the fan cover that caught fire.  The second one he's seen in this area in the past 2 weeks.  Luckily?? we were able to stop the flames before it melted anything but the fan cover itself.  So they are just replacing the fan cover.  Assured me it is a different model though.  They also told me that it happened because we were cooking popcorn (in a microwave popcorn popper) and it was too close to the ceiling.  But, we've used the exact same bowl in 3 different brands of microwaves over the past 10 years without a problem, so I just don't get it.<br />To my dismay, they didn't care about the burn marks on the ceiling of the microwave either.  Sure, it's not a large area, but it's still really noticeable.  Just told me I should be able to get it off with bleach, (which didn't work) or to go out and buy myself some touch up paint.<br />So there you go, up to you if you want to risk buying this model.  I'm not happy at having brown burn marks on the ceiling of a less than 1 year old microwave but their attitude is that it's my problem, not theirs.
Our JES2251SJ02 lasted 4 months past the 12 month warranty. The inverter blew and the cost for a replacement inverter was $225, a new JES2251SJ02 is $258 so were trashing it. GE is sending us a $100 credit check good only for another GE appliance. The repair man recommended buying the cheapest microwave available and getting the extended warranty on any appliance. Everything out there is trash, said he. I'm afraid he is right.
Only after having the microwave for slightly less than a year, the lettering on the keyboard wore off.<br /><br />Slightly after a year, the microwave totally broke. There was a power outage and subsequently the GE microwave never worked after it.<br /><br />Junk
One week after installing this over-the-stove, convection microwave, the stainless steel interior began to look spotted. A white cloth rubbed on the area revealed rust which continued growing like a severe rash on all surfaces of the inside. Sharp authorized a local service rep to make a housecall and examine it. He concluded the metal interior's defect, whereupon Sharp said they would replace (but not pay for reinstallation of) the unit. Removing the defective microwave and reinstalling will cost me $140!!! That wipes out any savings incurred by ordering online. Sharp's customer service will not compensate. I would have been MUCH better off buying from my local retailer who would have changed out the piece without charge in a situation like this. Live and learn. It is more than one month after the inspection and I have not received the replacement (said to be on back-order but still available online!!!).  <br />Aside from the interior cosmetic defect, the microwave looks great and works fine.
One of the worst appliances I ever bought.  And customer support on an issue with it was horrendous, and then non-existent.  I recommend anyone considering this unit to finish off their kitchen matched set of other Samsung products forgo aesthetics and get something else.  First, as others have stated, the control panel is awful.  It it hard to read and the buttons are set in such a way (presumable to keep someone from pushing a button unintended with cleaning the panel) that you have to press very hard in exactly the right spot.  No feel and go with this unit.  The food, in spite of the revolving turntable, does not heat evenly. The stainless steel for some odd reason is difficult to clean (exterior).  We have had other stainless steel appliances from other companies that cleaned easily. Then,  a short time after warranty expired, the unit failed to work.  It turns out some of the factory work was not done well on the circuit board and a loose connection caused a short and burned out the primary &#34;microwave&#34; unit.  The dealer told us it was out of warranty, so we had it repaired, then one of their repair people said it was a defect, not a warranty issue and I should contact Samsung.  They used every excuse in the book, and finally said something along the lines of &#34;policy does not allow us to ever pay out of pocket expense, regardless of the cause or situation&#34;.  End of story, end of Samsung.  Later, a salesperson told me they have had numerous complaints about the unit.  Samsung TV's are great.  But I will never own another one of their cheaply manufactured appliances!
One of the pieces that ensures the screws from the top of the cabinet holds the microwave in place was missing, so we cannot install it until Samsung rectifies the matter.  Seems crazy to send it back though since it's just missing a 50 cent bolt that can't be replaced at the hardware store.....
One of my worst Amazon purchases. I hate this microwave and deeply regret purchasing it.  It is GIANT and heavy, sits crooked on a flat surface, and heats food unevenly!  You can get WAY better for LESS MONEY!!!!!  Shocked, because usually Amazon reviews are so spot on.
Oh my goodness, I can't believe how horrible this microwave is. All this material used to construct something that is just going to clog up the landfill.<br /><br />Here's our story.  Back in April of this year (2014) our old microwave died. We needed a replacement right away because that's how our household rolls.  I eat popcorn, we microwave veggies.... So, hub and I rushed over to HomeDepot to get a replacement. This GE microwave looked nice. We bought it. We also, thankfully, purchased an insurance policy.<br /><br />Well, 2 weeks ago in May this General Electric microwave died. No electrical response at all. Took it back to HD and they replaced it with another.<br /><br />We assumed it was a fluke. That we just got a bad one. A lemon. NOPE. The second microwave died last night. Same symptoms. No warning. Just died.<br /><br />We are returning this General Electric microwave today. HomeDepot will give us another. However, we are also going to buy another microwave because we know this new GE piece of junk might not last out the week. With another microwave in the house we at least won't have to rush out to acquire another one.<br /><br />Don't buy GE. They might have made good equipment in the past but it's obvious that they are living off their reputation and that they don't have any quality control in their manufacturing process.
Not built to last more than the length of the warranty.  Do not buy.  Anyone giving it high marks has not had it for two years.
None available.

Nice looking microwave but has many problems. Lasted exactly 3 years then I had to replace. Since it is an over the range model that means you may be cooking things under it on the range that create steam. When the steam rises it gets into the electronics of the keyboard and shorts it out. replaced the keyboard at 2 yrs (forgot cost but was not cheap) and finally it has finally died. Poorly designed. Do not recommend.
Never, ever buy an LG microwave! Three years ago, I splurged and spent $800 on a microwave/convection oven combo. I trusted that it was a quality product and that would last -- wrong on both counts. In less than three years, the control panel failed and the repair was a control panel replacement at $670 which could only be made by a LG approved repair shop. LG customer service offered anything but service. They were surly, unhelpful, and they inflict THE most obnoxious and repetitious ad on lengthy hold victims (23 minutes). It now costs $350 to buy a new, non-LG microwave installed, so I'm reluctantly sending their shoddy product to the landfill. LG doesn't stand behind their product, they are not built to last, and I will never buy any of their products again. I hope you don't fall into the same, expensive trap that I did.
Never worked well, intermittently stops working - then starts again.  I would have returned this in the first WEEK, but once this monster is hung on the wall, and it's made its first bag of popcorn, who keeps the shipping box??  It finally died after the fan would not turn off, now it's completely inert.  The only bright side is it will fit in my community's GARBAGE CANS.  This unit has been a frustration since installation.
My wife called them and asked if they had a little time bomb inside.  How else could the thing die right on time.  The oven made the sound of shorting electricity, gave off a few whiffs of ozone, and that was it.  The young girl at the other end of the call said that they may be able to look into getting us a new part, but we would have to pay for labor.  I'm not going to throw good money after bad.  I'm just not going to buy Frigidaire items anymore.<br /><br />We have purchased the Gallery Stove and Oven (which we absolutely love) and then we purchased the Gallery Microwave (which died), and we purchased the Gallery Dishwasher (which doesn't wash dishes).  We also have a Frigidaire Furnace (that cracks me up every time), which works great.
My wife bought this microwave locally.    Her story:  - - -  I was unpacking it and I reached inside to remove the shipping cardboard.  Then I see some cardboard on the side and I took my fingernail and lifted it, and tore it out. Then I see a bunch of holes and a hole at the top where the cardboard was. Uh-oh! What did I just do? It is as thin as the cardboard on a school notebook, the thin kind, but it is silver in the light.  It looks like cardboard when you open the door. But how can that be, that I could take my fingernail and rip it out? And this is supposed to last for how long?    I called Whirlpool customer service, and the rep said she will send me the part. Then her manager said they don't have any parts so there is nothing they can do because I broke it. What? I ripped it with my fingernails and you are telling me this would have lasted how long anyhow?    I politely asked to speak with the supervisor. That took 15 minutes and he was so arrogant. But mam, you broke it. IT LOOKED LIKE cardboard and I ripped it with my fingernail. There is nothing we can do for you.    I can't take it back because the local store said that Whirlpool won't take it back. I will run the microwave until it dies and NOT BUY ANOTHER THING FROM WHIRLPOOL. I will call the attorney general and make a complaint against them.    I will never buy this again, or any appliance from Kitchenaid, Whirlpool, or Maytag! (And we currently have a refrigerator and dishwasher from them.)  - - -    I wish we would have bought this through Amazon.  At least then we would have a better chance to return it.    We got this one because we are replacing a Samsung microwave oven which was fantastic.  I would say it was at least 15 years old.  It had the controls along the top which was a terrific approach to making a compact, usable microwave with a small horizontal footprint and large interior.  Samsung no longer makes a similar design.    The only microwave ovens we've been able to find with a numeric keypad on the top are commercial versions which run over $800.  We hoped this one would be acceptable, but it's not.  The controls on the bottom are even worse than the side from a usability point of view.  We find ourselves bending over to see the labels on the buttons.  We really miss the numeric keypad, also.  With your head higher than the microwave, it makes so much sense to present the controls closer to your eyes.    This was a big mistake.
My Whirlpool microwave, 18 months old, caught on fire. I tried calling Whirlpool once and was told I would get a call back from someone in safety. Never happened. I called back, sat on hold for 35 minutes, then had a customer service rep hang up on me. WHIRLPOOL NEEDS TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THIS FAULTY PRODUCT. THIS KIND OF PRODUCT AND CUSTOMER SERVICE IS NOT OK. No one buy this product :Whirlpool WMC20005YW: it is a safety hazard!!!!!!!!!
My understanding is this paint comes 2 ways, 1 with a small brush like fingernail paint and the other in a spray can application, by the looks of this picture I thought this was the brush application bottle not the spray bottle but I received the spray bottle and could not contact the company to exchange it. No one answered the phone but they said to leave a message but the message box was full.
My story is so similar to the other reviews.  Bought mine in 3/2008 - loved it worked fabulous for about a year.  Just to the end of the warranty.  Whirlpool's response to my request for warranty service at 13 months on a top of the line appliance was Tough Luck - you should have bought our warranty.  I got it fixed $200.  Then I bought the warranty - $125.  Two months later, it was down again.  Over 3 months, and 4 appointments, they replaced nearly every interior part.  Finally it was fixed again.  Two weeks later.....it is down again.  Very disappointing.
My Samsung microwave worked fine until recently. It beeps!  It even starts beeping in the middle of the night.  I've unplugged and reset clock several times.  Now I have to unplug it after every use, and reset to use again.  Samsung online representative says if resetting doesn't work he would send a serviceman.  That would probably cost more than a new microwave.  I'll be searching for an new one.......definitely NOT a Samsung!
My microwave failed within 6 months of purchase.  It was fixed by a repair agency, who also told me that 'it is normal for them to completely fail and shut down.'  After the repair, it lasted only 2 months, before completely failing again.<br />Worst of all is Samsungs' customer service.  I couldn't imagine anything worse.  They (Samsung) have told me more times than I have fingers and toes, that they would call me back to make an appointment for service, but, after 3 weeks, I am still waiting for someone to call.  When I call in to Samsung, I am starting over each time (from scratch) even though they've given me a case number.  I'm tired of being told by their Indian representatives: &#34;I'm sorry for that!&#34;<br />Don't buy anything Samsung.
My husband and I purchased this on 5/27/13 .... the product has never worked.  I have been calling samsung for weeks and still the product doesn't work. Samsung has the worst customer service I have ever delt with. I am just trying to get a refund at this point.  I ask that they come and get it because,  I already paid to have it installed. ... I don't think I should have to pay to have taken out too. They said they will not send anyone and if I want a refund I have to send the plug and serial number . Again... just come and get it. Product is bad but the company is awful.  BBB rating for samsung appliances is an F wish I knew that before
My 1st unit fried and was unuasable. It was replaced after a few customer service calls and a service tech visit. The replacement unit makes a big noise and the vent fan is so loud that the entire sub division could hear our microwave. I have gone through several calls to their customer service and two service visits later the issue is still not fixed. DO NOT BUY THIS UNIT. It wasn't my choice..I got it from the new home I purchased and I am sure it's not going to last even 3 months.
Mounting an over the range microwave is a pain. The price is not worth replacing the unit every 10-11 months. Buy something else.
Missing the turnable shaft. Can't use it without this part. Will alter feedback once problem is resolved.
Mine caught on fire.  The inner top service cover that is made out of plastic caught on fire.
Microwave MCO165UW  over heats and turns off.  First week had repairman out, ordered parts, after 3 weeks Magic Chef still had not sent parts, sent them 2 day.  Repairman came back out and replaced parts.  Still overheated.  Magic Chef said heat water if it does not turn off it works like it is suppose to.  Cannot steam vegetables, cook baked potatoes and so forth.  Who buys a microwave just to heat water?  Do yourself a favor and NEVER BUY Magic Chef.
Microwave looked nice, but did not heat. It seemed like a fan was only blowing cold air. Amazon has great return policy, however, and it made the unfortunate buy easily reversed.
Microwave does it's job but door started sagging within first 30 days and the unit quit working within a year.
Microwave didn't work when I received it.  It was really disappointing.  It was a great looking microwave but very sad to have to return it.
Man I wish I'd read these reviews before buying this. I was at a local Big Box store and saw this on the shelf, decided to buy it on impulse.  After all, it's a GE and that's a great brand, right?<br />It was disappointing from the start. I don't use a microwave for much other that popcorn and heating freezer meals, and it couldn't even handle those. The popcorn setting burned the popcorn (my old, cheapo Sharp would always stop at just the right time.)  The meals were heated unevenly.<br />And now, after less than a month of very light use, the display flickers and it refuses to turn on.<br />After reading these reviews I decided it wasn't even worth repairing. I've junked it and bought a highly rated Panasonic from Amazon (along with a 3-year Square Trade warranty).<br />What a piece of junk!
Love the size, but didn't last a month!
Looks great, functions awesome while it is working. But with the digital display, it breaks very soon, and when it breaks, it feels like you can't get it fixed. Whirlpool would not respond well. They just direct us to local repair shops, and the response from them is horrible. Any replacement parts are always on back order and it is just a night mare to try to work with them sanely. I have been fighting with them for more 6 months now, and I just am so frustrated that I spend so much money on a product that would only work for few months, and I kept this useless microwave sitting nicely in the middle of my kitchen, just idle.     Horrific design and horrible customer service from Whirlpool.
Looks good, only worked a week. First - timer would work but no heating occurred, next dy everything looked like it was good ( lit up, revolving, timer working) but food temp was not changing. Cancelled replacement and have NOT been refunded.
Looks good, and had all the features we wanted.  Too bad it melted it's wiring last night.  Costs more to repair than to simply replace with newer less expensive model.
Like other reviewers this is the 3rd GE Spacemaker microwave I have owned.  We also built the space to fit this model and it is difficult to find a replacement.  I kept hoping with each new model that GE had corrected the problem.  The paint is peeling of the ceiling of my current microwave less than 2 years later. I worry that the paint will get in the food or worse that there may be a danger at using it.
Like most other reviews here, I can confirm that this microwave died quickly. After 2 weeks the handle broke off in my wifes hand. After 10 months we had a loose connection internally that needed to be repaired, and now after 16 months, the unit is completely dead. Fuses all check out fine. Thermal fuse, Thermocouple and power check out fine. All 120 volts. Either the control board for the keypad is dead, or the magnatron, HV capacitor or diode is shot. Either way, we are NOT repairing the unit again. It will be replaced with a commercial microwave and I will build a shelf for it to sit on over the top of our range. I will mount an exhaust fan below that and duct it all outside.<br /><br />This microwave has completely turned me off from the Samsung brand (which all of our appliances are). Too bad it's just cheap construction that ruins these new microwaves. They are all built with cheap components, unless you buy a commercial/industrial unit.<br /><br />Look at the Panasonic Pro series NE-1054, Vollrath 40830, Turbo Air TMW-1100M, or Amana RMS-10D for quality at a decent price. I wish they made a commercial over the range style, but I have yet to find one.
Like everyone else our November 2010 purchase has come to be the bane of our kitchen. If you never boil anything on your stove your experience maybe different but if your family requires food to survive I'd opt for a different microwave.
Late Package Delivery. Damaged Item.
Late last year we remodeled our kitchen. We put in top of the line Wolf/Sub Zero appliances that we always wanted, but we let our salesperson talk us into this Sharp microwave. This microwave hasn't even been in a year and the door is already separating from the glass (hard to understand since it is the one appliance that we rarely use-I am in a rigorous school program and my husband travels for work). I can almost fit my pinky finger into the gap that has formed between the door and the glass. The microwave is used maybe once a week for a reheat after a late shift. When I called Sharp about this issue, I was transferred to every department until finally the one I needed was closed. Yep transferred to different departments only to be told that they couldn't help and the one that could help me was closed for the evening. I called at 1pm MST. This is so frustrating to have my beautiful dream kitchen with this eyesore coming apart...who knows how they will have to rip it out. I am off to buy a Wolf drawer microwave; their helpful customer service goes out of their way to make sure you are satisfied.
Lasted 1 1/2 years.  Flimsy cardboard inlet cover on the left side of microwave, naturally absorbed some food during use.  Now, this cardboard has somewhat deteriorated, the machine is simply a very large fire hazard.  Catches fire immediately.  Not safe, terrible design.
Keypad error SE.  $185 to repair.  I'm getting a new microwave, but can't seem to find a good review on any of them from someone who had it more than 1 year.
Just moved into apartment where this had been installed new. Cooks OK so far (although not encouraged by the rest of the reviews here) but otherwise designed to frustrate -- minor features you've taken for granted after several decades of microwaving are nowhere to be found.<br /><br />- As others have mentioned, the three obnoxiously long beeps after cooking are bad enough; that they don't stop once you've opened the door is bonkers. And once you've opened the door, you're committed -- hit Clear all you want, you're getting the beeps. HOWEVER, if you hit Clear BEFORE you open the door, you can snip the beeps, which is good but why is the sequence an issue at all?<br /><br />- Can't set the timer and cook concurrently. Sorry multitaskers.<br /><br />- Clock gains between 2-3 minutes each day -- last synced with the stove (same brand, brand new) a month ago, and they're now 2 1/2 hours apart.<br /><br />- No way to open or close the door quietly, can only jerk it open and pop it shut.
Just like with the previous reviewer, this microwave worked well until it didn't work at all.  It started turning itself on and then the keypad stopped working.  Since we had bought the house with the microwave, we didn't have the  info we needed to return it but on the instruction manual, the previous owner wrote that it was installed in 2008 and the oven stopped working at the end of 2009.  The manufacture date on the unit said December 2007 so it was less than 2 years old.
Just like everyone else, I own this microwave. it died after 1yr of normal use right after the warranty ran out. When it worked there were no issues.
Just bought house with this unit in the house.<br /><br />It looks good.  The controls are awkward, the timer and fast button controls are not intuitive.<br /><br />However, it worked fine, has light under it and fan that works ok.<br /><br />My wife cooks popcorn init and it flames up, my wife throws the now burning popcorn bag in the sink and we clean it up.  The unit fails to start at all.<br /><br />I have never had anything flame in a microwave, especially with no metal or tin-foil at all involved, and fear replacing with the same brand, so looking at other.<br /><br />I definately would steer clear of these units as they seem to have multiplel issues.
I've only had it for around 2 months and it's starting to automatically come on when I close the door. The stop button doesn't turn it off. I have to open it and close the door until it shuts off or it automatically turns off.
I've had two service calls with this microwave within the one year warranty.  If it goes again, they tell me I am on my own. Shame on Whirlpool. I suspect that it may be more efficient to purchase a new microwave instead of having a service call for a circuit board that continues to be an issue. I'd steer away from this one....
I've had this microwave for 26 months. In that time I replaced the light under the microwave maybe 4 times. Sometimes it burned out, other times it exploded, but it seemed odd that that thing kept going. My previous cheapo microwave worked for 5 years and only needed the bulb changed twice.<br /><br />Then last night the light popped and the microwave blew the fuse. Since then, the fan and light have completely stopped working. The oven itself still works, but it makes me super uncomfortable how quiet it is as it heats, does it need the fan? Does it need to vent? I don't know. But I know after all the other comments I'm not reading on Amazon, that I'm not comfortable finding out.<br /><br />When I called LG, they asked if it was plugged in. I explained that the microwave worked, but not the fan or the lightbulb. She said it was probably my outlet. Not very helpful. When I called a repairman, he said fixing it would cost $200. Ugh, looks like I&#34;m in the market for a new microwave.
I've had this microwave for 10 months, and already the handle broke (apparently like everyone else's).  Dealing with the Bosch customer service group has been horrible...required like 8 phone calls to get a replacement part ordered under warranty, and then they wanted $99 for a tech to install it.  I finally convinced them to just send me the part for free so I could install it myself.  After removing the plastic trim from the inside, discovered that the screw holding the top part of the handle is behind a metal piece that seemed impossible to remove.  I just drilled through the metal and was able to get it done.  Whew!
I've had this mic for just over a year, and as with others, it just started turning on by itself this week. Fire hazard! Thank God I was home the first time it did it. It's 2.30am and it just woke me up by coming on again. Spooky to say the least, dangerous to say the most. I can't keep it plugged in anymore, and I assume, based on others' experience that I'm reading online, that it is no longer safe and I will have to get rid of it. What a rip off.
I've been trying to get through to Whirlpool about this microwave, having the same issues as everyone else. I don't ever remembering seeing a product with all 1 star reviews; I don't know if it's even worth getting this fixed through warranty after reading all these. I won't be buying any Whirlpool from here on including any other brand names they use.
it's starting not to work well - takes too long to heat food and leaves cold and hot spots.
It's a nice looking Microwave and it does a great job (when it works). Ours failed 2 weeks after the warranty expired. Repair cost was more than buying a new one so we ended up getting a new one.
It worked for three weeks and now it won't start. Luckily we kept the box and are sending it back. What a pain.
It was ok. Convection and bake worked OK. A lot of buttons to push just to get it to go. Usually I hit the 30 second button and then turned the knob. Also cannot see non illuminated buttons in a semi- dark corner of kitchen. However, the unit stopped working after 17 months. Just passed the warranty. Not happy.
It was delivered on Feb. 14, 2015 and has stopped working already. Brand new outlet so I know it's not that. Will not turn on at all and the return window closed on Mar 17, 2015.
It quit working one month after the date I could return it.  I had been out of town for 6 weeks after I bought it so it was barely used.
It may look pretty, but as an over the range microwave oven it provides nothing but headaches. Even a modest amount of heat from the cook top below causes the microwave oven's pushbutton door latch to deform (melt?) because Sharp chose to save money with plastic rather than metal interior parts. Thus, either the door won't close or one has to pry the latch open each time. The service technician who replaced the assembly (twice) said he had performed almost a dozen similar replacements in the recent past. <br /> <br />My advice, buy it only if you never plan to use the cook top below. <br />
It did not work upon arrival
It came slightly damaged but main problem is that it does not heat at all in any functions.  I have tried to heat a cup of water with Microwave Express, it looks like it is cooking but the water is at room temperature after 30 seconds.  Then I have tried all the functions and none of them work.  The surface light and the vent fan works fine.  I really should try it before I install it.  Now I have all the trouble to remove it and install another one.<br /><br />I order it from Amazon and contacted both the seller Home Care Company.  Since it is Saturday so I will have to wait up to two working days to to get a respond from Home Care Company.  I am not sure what will happen but I am not recommend to buy this product or buy it online.
installed in new home less than 18 months ago -- sharp covers their products for one year...it's a shame I didn't know this prior to buying it.
In my kitchen there is a wall directly to the left of the microwave space. The microwave I had before, a GE, worked fine, but the Whirlpool is hinged differently so that there needs to be more clearance to the left. I guess it is expected there are shallow cabinets on each side but in my case there's a wall so since the Whirlpool is hinged so the door requires more clearance, it does not fit. Nowhere in the specifications did I see that it requires more than an inch clearance to the left and cannot be installed with a wall to the left!
In January 2011 I purchased a PEM31SMSS GE spacesaver microwave because it was the only microwave with >400 watts of power I could find that would fit in the space I have.  It looked nice - better than a plain black box.  Approximately 4 months later the keypad stopped working and the microwave was replaced under warranty.  In August of 2011 the replacement microwave wouldn't turn off, and was replaced under warranty.  In March of 2012 after heating a cup of coffee, the third microwave just went dark and wouldn't work any more.  The stainless model was no longer available and was replaced with the black, which arrived yesterday.  Today I unpacked it and plugged it in.  The interior light won't turn off and there is no keyboard response when I press the START button because something in the latch isn't making contact.  I think I've had one of everything that could go wrong.  I would definately not recommend purchasing a GE spacemaker microwave of any style.
In all seriousness... shame on you GE.<br />I purchased this microwave a little more than a year ago. And of course it is now out of warrantee. And thus falling apart... LITERALLY!<br />The &#34;metal&#34; handle is not actually metal, it is cheap plastic with metallic-looking tape on it. And the tape is peeling off. When i called GE they said &#34;it's probably due to the heat from the stove below.&#34; I told them, &#34;It's an over-the-range microwave!!! It should not fall apart because of heat.&#34; To which they replied, &#34;Sorry. New handle is $100 bucks plus another $100 for someone to come out and install it.&#34;<br />I wish I could post a picture of the defective part here but the site doesn't allow me.<br />After a lifetime of thinking GE was the go-to brand for good quality products... this microwave will be the last GE appliance i ever buy.
I'm working on my second one of these. I returned the first one because I thought it was defective. It now turns out that they ALL are. If you set the time for more than a minute or two (I discovered this with a 4 minute cook time), at the end of the time, the clock cycles and then the micro starts running again for 30 MINUTES! After a week or so, I noticed that it was also starting up by itself even if it hadn't been used for a while. Major fire hazard! I had to start unplugging it between uses. Meanwhile, dealer would not take it back. I had to go through Whirlpool. They have non-existent customer service! They say they are going to call and never do. They say they are replacing it but it will be at least three weeks and then no one ever shows up. The dealer finally agreed to give me another one and deal with Whirlpool themselves. But now I find that the new one does the same thing: on longer cook times (e.g., 4.5 minutes), it starts up again for 30 minutes. I fear it will start turning itself on again. Has anyone had this same experience? Does anyone know of a fix? I'm being forced to replace it with some other model after only a few weeks because it scares me.
If you are by nature an angry person this is the microwave for you, as trying to use it will do nothing but make you angry.  If you pound on it just the right way, it will work for week or two, then quit. It worked for about a year, then started shorting out.  I had it repaired, but the repair only lasted about two months.  It's only few years old and hasn't been used much but it's already worn out the door latch is loose and won't close.  The warranty is only a year, which is no doubt how Bosche stays in business.  Stay away.
If this GE Profile Microwave is built like its cousin, the PVM1870, beware of the worst quality control and internal components possible.  In the two years we have owned a PVM1870 Profile, it has had 6 service calls and about every electronic part but the magnetron has been replaced, several components have been replaced TWICE.  I can accept and understand an electronic component failing, but not that many with some replaced twice -- does NOT speak well of either quality internal components, quality internal engineering or quality control.  The only reason that I gave it one star is that a zero star rating is not possible.<br /><br />Addendum:<br />The motor/power supply burned up AGAIN -- plus another service call for the vent door not opening any longer.  Now we are up to 8 service calls on the extended warranty.  This GE product is an ABSOLUTE PIECE OF JUNK and the last GE product we will ever own.  BTW -- the service personnel are excellent and know their jobs -- it is strictly the lack of build quality and quality control for this GE product that has caused so many failures.  It does not deserve ANY stars in the rating.
I would not recommend buying an appliance such as a microwave through Amazon.  Upon receipt of this item I had no idea that it had concealed damage.  Two days after receipt I elected to install the unit.  I noticed that the bottom corner of the door had a nice dent, but was something that I could live with, rather then deal with the agony of a return.  After installing the unit the door would not stay closed.  After looking the door over, I noticed that the clips where broken that hold it closed.  Totally frustrated at this point.  I have received a return mailing label and MRA number, but this will cost me $50 to ship back.  The unit was not shipped in no box, just corner molding, foam end caps, and shrink wrap &#34;No Original Packaging&#34;.  When it was all said and done, I bought the identical microwave under the Kenmore label from Sears for $100 less.  Multiple emails to Amazon on the return freight with no response.  This was a headache that I really didn't need.  I have purchased numerous items from Amazon in the past with no problems. This is a product category that would be best served by a professional retailer.
I would NEVER recommend this microwave to anyone. Within only a few months of owning, the handle broke off, and the front plastic cracked. Of course my husband lost the receipt, so we could not return it, so we've dealt with it with no handle for a year. Now the whole front plastic has broken off and the glass fell out so we can't use it any more. Why would LG continue to make such a poorly constructed product? The plastic is brittle and the construction is bad. I would say this microwave does not even heat food as well as some of my past cheap counter top models. If I could give this product 0 stars, I would. Please do yourself a favor and do NOT buy this product. We will never buy LG again.
I would never have bought this appliance if I had known the inlet cover (which seems like just a piece of cardboard) is just tacked on the inside of the microwave.  I've never seen that before.  It's not listed in the item description. I guess I didn't read enough of the product reviews.  While I do cover food in the microwave, it seems like it will get dirty and then damaged by things like butter from popcorn that will randomly leak out of the bag during popping.  Reviews for generic replacement inlet covers of this type say that they may catch fire due to food residue that is hard to clean off.
I wish I could give this zero stars. Bought this last year to go with my kitchen remodel. Every appliance I own is LG, washer and dryer included. Luckily, they still work. I work ALL the time and prefer my food grilled. I rarely use the microwave. Just bought it as a just in case method of heating leftovers. My microwave died today. Just stopped heating. Everything else apparently works on it. Apparently, a faulty magnetron is a wide spread occurrence. I did a live chat with an online rep. She wanted to send me to a service tech over an hour away. I declined. I explained to her similar issues from most owners of this model and stated this should be looked at as being recalled. No way we all messed up our units. I forwarded her to the Amazon reviews. She was basically like yeah, ok, do you want me to find you a service center? At the end of our conversation, she just ended the session. I wasnt finished chatting with her. I will NEVER buy an LG appliance<br /><br />Chat log:<br />Chat Transcript<br />Time of chat: 7/2/2015 4:54:35 PM<br />Length of chat: 00:18:41<br />Your name: rafael vazquez<br />Chatted with: Michelle, Paulsen<br /><br />4:54 PM Michelle: Hello rafael vazquez.

I went to open my microwave and the handle snapped ...yup snapped off into pieces!  Frigidaire will so graciously allow me to buy a new one as their way of standing behind their product....yes so we purchase an expensive microwave that is made so cheaply that you have to replace the handle that breaks apart and they get more money-yes that does sound right doesn't it?  But they stand behind their products....So frustrating!  Unless you have money to burn on replacing parts-DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I was looking for the microwave with certain size with a basic function. I was so happy to find this product at Amazon.<br />The first one arrived last week, but I had to return it next day. It made clicking noise when I closed the door. It also make some noises when I push &#34;Start&#34; button.<br />The second one, I received today and connect, set up clock, and start with a cup of water to make sure it works.  I felt bad returning the same product twice.<br />This time, I called Whirlpool customer service. The personnel told me the information she has is the same &#34;product guide&#34; (which comes with the product).
I was laughing when I read the reviews, the same exact thing happen to us, we just bought a new condo and the microwave came with it. I started thinking that may be the house was haunted or something. The control panel stopped working and the microwave start by itself and stop by itself. Stay away from this microwave you'll waste your money.
I was just heating my lunch and once the cycle ended (fan, light and turn table turned off) the heating keep going. The only way to make it stop is to unplug. Seems like many people are having the same issue after just a couple years. I just read on the forums that  the control board is the issue which costs around $160. Piece of crap. Poor design, and also the timer is useless and other featured that are annoying. Stay away from this product.
I was initially impressed with this oven. But in less than three months it was trouble. As other reviewers have said, the oven will turn itself on. The plastic exterior will crack due to the heat from the range. And whirlpool has made customer satisfaction a priority despite the numerous complaints about this oven. My oven was ultimately replaced by my builder under the builders warranty guarantee. The replacement oven (brand new) also cracked and continues to malfunction intermitently. Whirlpool should recall all of this garbage and offer replacements. I think it is legally and certainly morally wrong to continue to sell this inferior, overpriced, and potentially dangerous product especially since that have been notified of problems that can be documented by the repair companies they contract to service these thing.<br /><br />I am thoroughly disappointed in this product and the lack of customer support from Whirlpool.
I was in a hurry to purchase a microwave after mine had died.  I didn't spend any time researching as I normally do and made an on the spot decision at the store.  That turned in to a huge waste of time.  I bought the microwave, brought it home and installed it only to find that it was a lemon.  The electronics all worked, however, when plugging it in, the fan would kick on while the tray rotated as if the heat sensor was bad.  As a result, the unit did not function.<br /><br />I should have known after reading a few mediocre reviews while I was in the store to stay away.  My desire to get it done outweighed common sense.<br /><br />The Microwave is in the box being returned today and I'll have to do it again and likely drill new holes.  I don't plan on exchanging for the same model.
I want to clarify that I did not buy this microwave from Amazon (we bought it during a sale at Home Depot)  I hope this review will serve to caution anyone who is interested in Whirlpool products to buy a different brand or at least buy an extended warranty. We owned the microwave for 1 year and 3 months before the magnetron went out (the manufacturers warranty was for 1 yr and opted NOT to buy the extended warranty).  I understand that modern appliances don't last forever and that some parts may break on a high usage item (handles, knobs, etc).  What I have problem with is when the part that makes it a microwave lasts only one year鈥n an item I paid approximately $275 for.  When I contacted Whirlpool, they offered to sell me an extended warranty and advised me of the charge for the part and labor to replace it.  Home Depot tried calling Whirlpool Customer Service on my behalf, but hit the same brick wall I did.  I am sure most moderately priced appliances have roughly the same &#34;shelf life&#34;, but I did expect a $275 product to last a bit longer than 15 month.  Either I bought a lemon or there is a conspiracy to get people to pay more for an extended warranty...
I spent several thousand dollars on Samsung appliances as part of a kitchen remodel in Oct11.  In May I noticed that when I opened the door of the microwave it appeared to have a short (a bright light flashed then went out).  It still heated but as I thought it might be a fire hazard I contacted Samsung.  They set me up with a service repair company that had a poor rating on Angie's list.  A guy came out, dismantled it and said a key part needed to be replaced (he noted 'switches' on the service order dated May 15th).  He said it would take 3-5 days so he came back a week later, without the part, saying he just need to tighten some wires.  It worked for a few weeks, then started to heat only intermittently.  Called the service company again, and a guy came out and jiggled the door, saying there was a problem with the switches, but that they didn't need to be replaced.  It worked again for a few weeks, where I had to keep jiggling the door, and finally stopped heating altogether.  Now, knowing that there was a problem with the switches, I expected the guy to arrive with the needed part.  He came but again, no part, saying he just wanted to confirm it was the switches and that the part had already been ordered.  After not hearing anything for a few weeks, I called back and was told that 'Sharp parts were backordered'.  When I told her it was a Samsung, she didn't look up my order but just said she would look into it and call me back.  After not hearing anything again, I called back and she said the same thing (Sharp is back-ordered, correction it's Samsung)and said she would call me back.  Again didn't hear back so called Samsung.  The escalation department reviewed the situation and I was put in for an exchange because the process had gone on so long.  She said I would get a call from someone who would review options with me (when I asked what the options would be she didn't know--why is that?).  Instead, I got a call from Samsung a week later saying that the servicecompany had miraculously received the part and they wanted to schedule a service call.  I told her I had been put in for an exchange and she insisted that I again deal with this disreputable service company.  I refused, and since I didn't have the Transaction # she said she would call me back today.  She didn't call this morning when she said she would so I called Samsung.  Just got off the phone with Samsung, who refuses to replace my microwave.  It just seems to be a game of stringing customers along with vague and misleading promises.  The only 2 service companies they have for this area have F ratings on Angie's list.<br />I had a similar situation occur with my 1 month old stove back in December, which broke on Xmas Eve.  After 3 months of fighting with Samsung Best Buy finally felt sorry for me and gave me a new stove.<br />After spending thousands of dollars on Samsung appliances I expected more from Samsung.<br />I would stay away from Samsung or if you do purchase an appliance from them, get an independent warranty.  Customer service is a problem area for them.
I so wanted this small microwave to work.  My plates fit, a small cup fits, but my normal coffee mug is too tall.  The inside is only 5.5 inches high from the rotating plate, not 6-3/4&#34; as the website describes.  So my 6&#34; coffee mug doesn't fit.  Returned.<br />If Whirlpool would make the same mike to hold 12&#34; plates and a 7&#34; mug, I would buy that.  A little more power would be nice too.
I should have heeded the warnings in these reviews.  We bought this because it fit our space, but the door button broke.  The door won't open when the button is pushed, it just unlatches and you have to pry it open.  What's worse, the GE repairman came to fix it and he just added some lubrication and said it was fine.  He refused to replace anything.
I received the Microwave but it is not working at all. Then I need to return it, just wasting my time.
I received the microwave and it didn't even work. I didn't have the original packaging so they wouldn't refund me. Brilliant. lol
I received on time, but with damage on the door and left side and with out grill,I'm not so happy
I received a Danby Microwave for Christmas 2011.  Less than 4 months later it stop working  I called the Danby 800# and was told what to do.  I did this and have not heard anything back.  I have attempted numerous times with no success on getting my refund.  Loss to my family of $85.00<br /><br />I will never buy another Danby product or recommend one.

I put a SMH9187ST 1.8 cu. ft. Over-the-Range Microwave (Stainless Steel) in my vacation home.  After four or five months of light duty use, we returned home to find the door standing open and the light on inside.  There is apparently a spring in the door that holds the two latches in the closed position.  That spring either came off its mount or broke, because the latches no longer hold the door closed.  I asked Samsung to tell me how to open up the door so I could replace the spring.  They said no, I'd have to pay them for a service call.  I asked if they would tell me how to remove the door so I could take it to a local repair shop.  No, again.  Keep in mind that the spring apparently failed while the unit was just sitting there, not in use.  The really scary part of this is that if it had failed during use, the door would have opened on its own potentially allowing a major leakage of microwave energy into the kitchen.  ,
I purchased this unit to replace a GE spacemaker because it was the only one I could find that would fit in the cabinet space.  The new unit would not heat food when it arrived.  I am requesting an immediate replacement from the supplier.  I recall when GE had a good reputation in appliances, but now I have a low opinion of their quality.
I purchased this produce when it first came it and loved the look of the unit.  Within a year the interior paint has peeled off on the inside of the door and the inside of teflon coating of the unit.  The stainless still overs have been glued back on 3 times now and just recently the door handle broke.  I never leave review because honestly I am too lazy but I just had to warn buyers of this product.  I have contacted Whirlpool twice and they told me that the paint was cosmetic and is only covered under the 30 day warranty.  Really??? paint is supposed to chip within 30 days?  Then the other parts are also cosmetic but they can get an technician to come out at my cost of course.  Lastly, despite all the bad reviews, the have determined this product has no quality issues. I will NEVER buy a whirlpool product again.
I purchased this model in stainless steel three years ago. Problems I found with it were mostly concerning the sensor cooking being completely inaccurate. Some items cooked or were warmed too little and some were much too hot. It was easier to simply time it myself.    But the straw that broke the camel's back for me on this unit was how long it lasted. It simply quit heating last week after being 35 months old. Everything else works but nothing gets warmed or cooked, leading me to believe the magnetron went bad. The microwave comes with a one year parts and labor warranty and a ten year parts only warranty on the magnetron. In speaking to an authorized repair center for Samsung, I was told I would pay a $99 trip charge to determine what is wrong, and if it is the magnetron, an order would be placed with Samsung for the part which will take three to six weeks to arrive and then I would have to pay another trip charge and labor to R & R the magnetron. Bottom line - even with the magnetron warranty, it will cost me more than I paid for the microwave to repair it.    I have had several microwaves since 1978 when they became popular. I have never had one that lasted less than 10 years. When this one went bad last week, I pulled out a countertop model Sharp Carousel that I bought 15 years ago and am using it, still working perfectly. I went to Lowe's where I purchased the unit and told the salesman that I went all Samsung three years ago while remodeling my kitchen and am now worried about the other units, particularly the refrigerator because it is making noise that it shouldn't. He told me that he has had more complaints about Samsung microwaves than any other brand and any other kind of appliance, and the only kind of appliance that Samsung has not had numerous complaints on is their ranges.    I have had serious issues with Samsung's customer service in the past due to owning many of their electronics. If you read any reviews about their service after the sale, you will find it is virtually nonexistent. But I wrote an email to Samsung letting them know that in my opinion, a microwave should last longer than three years and am very disappointed with the product. Naturally, I have not received a response of any kind.    I strongly suggest anyone considering buying a Samsung microwave to look elsewhere. They are not built to last and getting service after the sale from them is impossible.
I purchased this microwave in January of 2015. In July of 2015 the microwave completely stop working. The whole microwave stop working the clock, everything. I want to get my money back. Most microwaves last for years. I have had a microwave that lasted for 25 years. To have a microwave last for only 6 months is disappointing.
I purchased this microwave in February, 2014. It was  perfect size but stopped working within three months.  After contact with Whirlpool via phone and email, I was told by the Whirlpool Product Review Board to dispose of it in accordance with law because there was no dealer where I lived to return it to.  I took it to my local metals' disposal site and provided proof of compliance to Whirlpool.  The Whirlpool Product Review Board then promised repeatedly over a three-month period that a check would be sent for the purchase price.  They apologized for the delay, at one time emailing to me that my Buy Back Check order was stuck in the system.  Then, after three months of promises, Whirlpool stopped all communication with me. More than two more months have passed since then and I still haven't received my Buy-Back check. I don't expect to get one.  Do not buy this product.  You can see from several of the reviews that you risk buying a lemon.  In my case, I lost $152.78 and spent many, many hours, time and money doing exactly what Whirlpool told me to do to collect on the warranty.  Whirlpool apparently does not honor it's warranties, at least not for this product.<br /><br />P.S. 10 days after this review was posted, Whirlpool issued a refund check.
I purchased this microwave and have had problems since day 1. You can not run timer and microwave at the same time.  Turntable makes a weird noise and continues to get worse.  The paint has chipped off and now metal shows through.  Moisture comes out of top of the micro and has damaged my cabinet above.  I don't even use unless I have to until I can find another one to replace this one.
I purchased this item brand new. I used it only a few times in a period on less than 2 months. It failed in less than 30 minutes of use. Amazon's return policy doesn't cover this item, and nobody keeps the product box so the manufacturer warranty may be worthless (more in shipping than product is worth). Do not buy this item.
I purchased this in 2010 and it worked great. Then a couple of weeks ago I came into the kitchen and saw the SE error code. I wasn't able to set the clock so I unplugged it and started researching what the error code meant. As you have probably read in other reviews, this is a common Samsung problem. The steam from cooking on the stove underneath the microwave damages the cooking sensor which causes the entire oven to malfunction. And please understand that I haven't used my stove top for cooking on a regular basis!<br /><br />After a couple of hours, I plugged it in to see what happened and was able to set the clock and use it. I was thrilled but cautious. Which was good because within 10 minutes I heard the microwave beep and start cooking. I shut it off and watched it and within 15 seconds, I saw &#34;Baked Potato&#34; on the screen and it started up again. So now it's unplugged and will be replaced.<br /><br />Samsung says it's out of the warranty period but will send a technician to fix it for more than it will cost me to purchase a new unit. I did get five years out of it so I'm chalking it up to lessons learned - no more Samsung microwaves. When they have this many ovens with the same problem, you would think the company would make things write. To be fair, I have always owned Samsung televisions and been very happy with them. Maybe the microwave business isn't for them?
I purchased a recently updated condo built in 1969.  All the kitchen appliances were purchased in 2012 and unfortunately all of them were Frigidaire.  Not even 3 months into living in the condo and the Microwave died.  All the keys of the control panel won't work.  I just called to get someone to look at it and they charge $80 just for an estimate.  A new microwave is $200.00 but after reading all these reviews, I will buy anything but Frigidaire. I never had any appliances from this brand before in any of my homes and now I know why.  Total waste of money.
I purchased a PEM31SMSS GE microwave because fit in the space I have, and also look good, but let me tell you if you thinking buying some thing like this PICE OF JUNK, only going to last you the most 2 years, or less that is what it lass me, when you call GE they ready to sell you a new one problably with the same problems.
I purchased a GE Profile Spacemaker 2.0 oven model #JVM2070 BHO2 in 2007. About a year later the handle came off in my hand. I did my own repair but in so doing found the quality of construction to be quite poor. Self threaded screws in inferior quality plastic was the problem. Now, the keypad will not accept any inputs. GE only sells a control assembly at nearly $400 (the oven originally cost about $500). GE says their ovens are not consumer repairable and refer customers to a repair facility. My options are to pay a GE technician $75.00 to tell me the control assembly must be replaced at a cost of $400 or buy another brand of oven with a longer service life. Which option do you think I will choose?
I ordered one of these on line. It came in promptly. I found that it was bent on the bottom, bent on a piece of stainless steel across the front and the vent damper that came inside the oven was damaged. This appeared to be a factory sealed unit. <br />It had to come from the factory like this. Possible the bottom was bent somewhere in shipment ranging from the factory to the shipper. Since I got it on Friday, I went ahead an installed it thinking that Sharp would simply send me the parts as they were screw on simple replacement parts. I was wrong. First Sharp said they did not warrant cosmetic damage. I told them it was factory shipped that way, please send parts. They said NO! Ship it back to who I bought it from. I, after much argument, had to take it down and send it back. This ended up costing the seller shipping charges which they paid. I felt this was not right as Sharp could have easily fixed the problem. The shipper did not have another unit in stock, so I got a refund and ended up buying another brand locally. The foam in bottom of carton was very thin (none in middle), thus, subjecting the unit to shipping damage. I had a Sharp before this one that never gave any real problems, but their customer service really sucks!  <br /> <br />My advise to you is to carefully check ANY microwave oven you buy before you leave the store or install it. Apparently the factories in USA or Korea do not do this before they ship them. <br />I finally got my replacement oven installed, but it was the third unit to get one that was not bent right out of the box.
I never got to use this microwave oven because the door would not stay shut.  I had to send it back.  Darn.  Amazon was very helpful and took care of my problem.  I am pleased with Amazon's service.
I must prequalify this review with the statement of fact that we have 4 major Samsung appliances or electronic devices in our home. I have always liked Samsung.<br /><br />Bought and installed this microwave in January of 2012. It just died two days ago. Totally dead... no functionality whatsoever. No lights, no keypad, nothing but dull, silent, insolent non-function. It isn't my circuit, as my oven (also Samsung) shares the outlet and is working fine.<br /><br />I called Samsung, and since it is just out of warranty, the service call would be $125 just to look at it + parts and labor. On top of that, the first call would be the diagnosis, and the technician would not have the parts. They would have to reschedule for that.<br /><br />Since I have a toddler in the house, not having a microwave is out of the question. So the risk of a $200-$250 repair bill + 2 weeks of being out of commission basically means I have to go buy a new *&#!$ microwave.<br /><br />Argh. So irritating. DO NOT BUY.
I loved this when I first received it. It looked great and didn't take up a lot of space. I really wished it hadn't died, but after 1 year of very, very light use, I turned it on (with a cup of coffee in it) and it threw out a small spark and some smoke and then it quit. It was quite scary (because I was standing next to it). I would definitely not recommend this microwave.
I loved the small size of this microwave, but the power was lacking. Furthermore, after we had this unit for 1 month, it would not cook anything longer than 2 minutes. The light would remain on and the turntable would continue to spin, but the motor would just shut off and cease cooking. We returned this product.
I loved the price on this microwave. So did my 90 year I'll grandfather.  We bought it and he was excited to have back the way he can cook most of his meals. Sadly though, half of the button do not work. He can not set the clock or defrost... I offered to try and return it, but he needs it to cook, and it can do that I guess. But I don't recommend this product at all.
I love GE.  I'm an energy star freak.  Then tonight, 1.5 years after I've moved into my brand new house with brand new appliances, this microwave caught on fire while popping popcorn using the popcorn button.  The popcorn was fine... But the entire top of my microwave has melted into gross plastic blobs.  Thank god I was paying attention.
I know you get what you pay for, in most cases, but in this case, I don't feel I did. I expected it to take longer to heat than my old 1000 watt, but it takes at least twice as long. The turn table rattles, and because of it's light weight, you have to hold it with your left hand while pushing the button to open the door with your right, otherwise you will push it across the counter. Very displeased.
I know I purchased a refurbished unit, but a noticeable dent on the face of it is unacceptable.  I'm returning this unit.
I just went on the internet to see if anybody had this model in stock, and prices available. We bought this model 2 yrs ago when we re-did our kitchen. Ours also went bad after only light use. Mostly reheating items.  The service tech said he couldn't believe a Whirlpool product would fail like that. The shield by the magnetron had a hole burned through it and was allowing the microwaves to escape, thus shutting the unit off after just a couple seconds. Seems like a dangerous situation to me. I wonder how Whirlpool feels about this? Far less than satisfied.  Will avoid Whirlpool products in the future. Less than 1 star review.
I hit the start button and sparks flew and dead microwave.  I think this model could be a fire hazard.  Called Sharp, even though the microwave was under warranty when the problems started... they were of no help.  They send a repair service who promptly told me there was a $75 &#34;show-up fee&#34; and repairs would be an additional charge.  Very disappointed in Sharp and will definitely not consider  another of their products.
I have to agree with the other 1 star review. I would also give it zero stars if possible. This is my second GE Microwave that has died after one year. Last time it was the turntable motor, this time it was the control panel.  Of course the replacement is over $125. They produce garbage. No more GE for me.
I have owned a suite of Ge Cafe products  ( i.e. refrigerator, stove, microwave and dishwasher ) for approximately 6 years now. My recommendation is stay away. My refrigerator has seen a visit from the repairman four times. My stoves plastic knobs melted off and I was kindly advised by GE that I could now buy new metal ones for $300. My dishwashers dispenser in not dispensing. And now to round things off my microwave's touchpad is not functioning as it should. GE is comping me the parts which the repairman quoted me $1,225.00 and labor at $100.00(my responsibility). I read from other poster's comments that this issue will happen again. I contacted GE, advised them of the cost ,and suggested that I apply my labor cost towards the purchase of a new microwave. I was shot down. New microwave  $750.00 vs paying $1225 for parts??? If I were a  GE shareholder I would be outraged at this type of irresponsible spending. Multiply this type of activity several thousand times over and you're talking serious money. Quality has seriously gone down since the days my parents bought GE products. They have lost a future customer in me and my family. If you're considering this line of products buyers beware.
I have one of these guys in my kitchen and I hate it. It is mediocre in performance and louder than your average landscaper's leaf blower. Thanks, but no thanks!
I have made the mistake of buying two GE space saver microwaves for my two homes. Both have badly peeling paint not only inside the door but on the back wall of the microwave as well. Got same answer form GE.buy the paint and paint it myself.  Did buy the paint but by then the rust was too extensive to nake it work. I am also looking for a nice microwave about the same size and features!
I have had two of these. Both of them had the LCD Display fail and the plastic buttons crack, warp and other wise fail as well.
I have had this microwave less than 2 years and I too am getting the SE error code.  It is $99 just for someone to look at it!  You can't press any of the buttons.  This obviously is a manufacturer issue if there are so many complaints about it.  Now I have to spend another $300 on a new microwave not Samsung.
I have had this microwave for 1 year now, it has broken 3 times and Sharp has been terrible about getting it fixed under the warranty.  Opening / shutting the drawer is very sensitive & therefore the drawer stops working.  No turntable which means you need to manually spin your food around as needed.  Overly complicated directions.  Too expensive for what you get!
I have had the same problems as the others who wrote on here. I had a white over the range GE microwave that started having keypad problems. Since I was upgrading to stainless appliances, I bought this one and after 3 yrs. started having problems with the keypad again. Some of the buttons stopped working, then one night I woke up to a beeping sound and on the microwave display it said service immediately. I will not buy another GE appliance again, I would like to know what brand is a good one to go with.
I have extensive experience in refinishing metals; it is difficult to get paint to adhere to aluminum.<br />I power-sanded the entire interior down to bare metal.<br />Contrary to the LABEL claims, THIS PAINT DOES NOT ADHERE TO BARE METAL!!<br />Once dried, it scrapes off with your fingernail.<br />Q: The factory paint failed despite having been primed so how could this paint work with No Primer??<br />A: IT CAN'T!<br />If I were to repeat this process, I'd have first primed it with a high-temp, self-etching automotive primer.<br />Maybe then there'd be a prayer of success...<br />Bottom Line: Unless you're willing to go thru the tedious process of properly preparing AND PRIMING, DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT.<br />PS:  (2) Cans are required to adequately refinish the entire interior
I have been shipped TWO of these microwaves and they were both DOA. Different issues. Sharp might consider testing them before they leave the factory. I won't purchase another sharp microwave. The customer service was slow and did nothing to help me. I could haul it to a local service center and they said that the tech might be able to fix it while I waited but I've been to enough service centers to know that this is not likely. I'm not happy at all.
I have a General Electric microwave model PEM31SM4SS manufactured November of 2011 in Maylasia and it is peeling on the interior across the rear top. I replaced the previous unit because of the same problem.  It also was relatively new at the time.  About two years. Painting seems to be the option offered for repair. Maybe General Electric should include a can of paint and brush with their microwave ovens. I will purchase a new one this week but not GE
I have a Frigidaire microwave model CFMV 164LS, a former version of this model installed in my RV.  It quit working after 3 months of use.  After weeks of trying to get it replaced under warranty, Frigidaire has finally found someone to do the replacement with this model but Frigidaire has now refused to pay the service fee for doing the replacement where the unit is located.
I had this microwave GH7208XRS slightly over one year ago. Today the digital display went out. It is going to cost alot of repair it. I definitely would not recommend anyone buy this unit unless you get the extended warranty.
I had this installed when I did my first kitchen remodel about 6 years ago. Then all of a sudden in April of 2009, the unit stopped working. Everything else was fine except that it would not heat the food. It would even make all the noise and so on. So, I had to replace it, and decided to just buy a new one and reinstall it. To my horror, less than 2.5 years later, I have the exact same failure. On top of this, if you need any repair service, they charge you a minimum of $100 to just come and diagnose and on top of that charge you for parts and labor! I am so unhappy and furious for this to have happened twice in a row. I will never again buy anything from GE!!! And charging almost 40% of the price of a new unit just for someone showing up at your door is quite silly.
I had it for about a year and a half now when the door is closed it just runs without producing heat.  I guess I could get it repaired but I'm wondering if it's worth it.  I may just buy a better quality microwave so I don't have to deal with it again.
I had been using this microwave for only about two years when it suddenly began turning itself on! REALLY scary!! A bad fire hazard, and I have found others who report the same phenomenon with the same model. Wondering why it has not been recalled and who to lodge a complaint with!!
I got this wine cooler as a gift. Looks nice.  I saw the reviews and assumed that the machine will fail after a few months.  It lasted barely more than a year and a half. After approximately a year it was making very loud noises and it did not longer cool. I use it as a wine rack (off) but will bring it to the curve one of this days.<br /><br />run away.
I got the product out of the box and it doesn't work. It will do everything but heat up inside. I need to ship it back but between work and school there's no time. I will just ask for my money back.
I feel that there is a design flaw in this product. The SENSOR REHEAT button it just below the STOP CLEAR button and very easy to push by mistake. This very thing happened to our Microwave oven on January 27 2008, after a few minutes we could smell burning plastic, I ran into the kitchen and found the microwave smoking and after unplugging the unit I found that the door seal had a melted hole in it. I feel that an automatic feature like SENSOR REHEAT should not be an AUTO DESTRUCT! This could have become a very serious situation by starting a fire or having melted plastic stick to someone. I did not have the original receipt because it was a gift in 2007 and it is not worth paying the shipping charge to send it back, I wanted to inform you of this dangerous condition. We have replaced the microwave with another Sharp R402JK without the SENSOR cook, we have always liked sharp products and it is sad that this unit failed to live up to the Sharp reputation From Sharp Minds come Sharp Products  Sharp refused to honor the warranty saying that it was a consumer fault  by running the microwave with nothing in it. I feel this is a very dangerous flaw, you can just lean against the control panel and the unit will start up and run untill it melts.
I feel like I made a big mistake buying this online, I would find a better brand and quality, then bigger one for even less buying it local. I paid over $100 shipping and it doesn't worth it, it's small and at the beginning it didn't heat. It's more or less now but not what I expected!
I did not buy this microwave on Amazon, but felt compelled to add to the feedback as I buy many other products here using the customer reviews.  I bought this microwave 2 years and 2 weeks ago.  It completely failed last night.  It was running as normal, got very loud, then completely died.  I've reset breakers and checked that power is still being supplied.  Everything checks out.  Samsung wants $288 for the service contract to fix it, but as of this posting, that's how much a new microwave costs.  Do yourself a favor and avoid this microwave.
I did not buy this here but from the store with the blue shirt associates; my model is SMH9187, which is similar to this one. This was installed by my contractor during a complete kitchen remodel and looked great above the Samsung range. After about 2 years, I got what all those 1-star raters got, a sudden incessant beeping that you could not reset or turn off, other than through unplugging the appliance. I tried turning off the main power, etc. but nothing worked; in fact, the error message and beeping became continuous.<br /><br />Friends of mine have had the same model for over three years and they have not had this problem. Why? Because I cook a lot of steamed food (rice, pasta, vegetables) and they do not. I'm sure the heat and steam from the range top has, as others have noted, damaged the circuit board. The keypad is over the right back burner, and even if I use any of the front burners, the steam will cover the entire front of the microwave; this happens even with the fan at full blast. There is always a film of condensation over the bottom half of the microwave.
I chose this microwave to go along with the GE Cafe range I purchased at the same time. I read multiple poor reviews of this microwave online, but decided to risk it because I wanted the microwave to match the range. Bad choice! After owning the microwave just over a year, the magnetron konked out. Luckily, that particular part was covered under a 5-year warranty, but I still paid nearly $200 for labor. Now, just a couple of years later, the touchpad has expired and will need to be replaced. The service department tells me this repair will be a minimum of $250. (Touchpads start at $150.)<br /><br />I have never had so many problems with an appliance. The refrigerator I bought at the same time has never required service. The washer and dryer I bought nearly ten years earlier have only once required service. Yet this microwave has required two expensive repairs within just a few years of purchase. Before I bought this GE Cafe microwave, I had a cheap, unremarkable countertop model. I don't even remember the brand. But it was still working when I upgraded to the GE Cafe, so even though it was nearly 20 years old I was able to pass it on it to a neighbor whose child was starting college. At this point, I wish I'd kept the old one! I will never buy GE Cafe again.
I brought a samsung SMH9187ST back Nov. 2010, which is the same exact microwave as the SMH 1816S with the exaact same features listed. On June 14, 2011, I had a technician come to my home to repair this unit. This unit was under warranty at the time. On May 6,2012, samsung microwave display SE on the screen. Call samsung office and they referred me to a service tech. also, stating the unit was not under warranty regardless of the last repair date. I call the service tech. office somewhere in Norcross,GA.to find out what it would cost for a visit to my home. The office employee(not the tech.) stated the tech. visit for my area would be $140.00 to look at and replace the unit part which would cost $75.00. Total cost $215.00 The employee that was not a tech. quoted me the cause of my problem and the part that cause the problem without some even looking at the unit. Sounds like the repair company already have a lot of information without every touching or looking at this samsung microwave unit. This appears to be an on going problem with this unit even though the on thing that has change is the model number Samsung SMH1816S.<br />If, you have not had a problem in the first year consider yourself lucky. When you have had two problems in 18 months with this unit it is time for a recall on your product. Stay away from this microwave unless you don't mind an inconvenience and spending more money.
I bought this unit to replace an older LG model that was discontinued.  The older model worked fine until I melted it with a small kitchen fire (naturally the one time I disconnected the smoke alarm).  The new model arrived quickly.  I got a friend to help install it.  You'll need a friend  -It's too heavy for you to hold it up with one hand while you screw the bolt on with the other.<br /><br />I gave it four stars in my initial review but I'm changing it to one star because after only a couple of months, the microwave's fan and interior lights would go on sometimes when I closed the oven door.  But if I opened and gently closed the door again, it'd turn off.  It's been about six months since I first installed this oven and this problem is becoming frequent.  Today, my son texts me from home that the microwave won't turn off no matter what he does so I told him to leave the door open and when I get home tonight, I will disconnect it so it doesn't burn the house down.  A microwave oven is supposed to make our lives more convenient,  not fill us with dread that it can start an electric fire.  Checking on the internet, it seems that this is not an uncommon problem.  It's probably not going to be covered by warranty.  And how do I get it to the manufacturer?  They aren't going to pay a repairman to make a housecall for a lousy microwave oven.  If I pay for shpping both ways, I might as well buy a new microwave.  Lessons learned:  I will buy appliances from a brick and mortar store whose return/service policy I understand and I will not use an over-the-range microwave again.
I bought this microwave three years ago, so the warranty has long expired.  I now have the same problem as everyone else -- the keypad has a short and the microwave is now completely useless.  Have to buy an entirely new microwave, since the cost of repair meets or exceeds the cost of an entirely new microwave.  DO NOT BUY THIS MICROWAVE.
I bought this Microwave oven on June 1st 2010.  The handle is broken apart and the handle is loose  also the bottom of the doors have a crack.
I bought this microwave less than a year ago.  Worked fine for reheating and defrosting items, but being a 700 watt microwave, it did take longer to do those things.  One day, after ~8 months of use, I placed a cup of coffee to reheat, and it failed to work; power on, lights working, but no luck.  Don't waste your money or time.
I bought this microwave in October for a kitchen we are having remodeled.  Got it installed about 3 weeks ago and was microwaving some bacon last night and smelled a funny electrical burning smell.  It is apparently fried (which is what I'll be doing with my bacon until this POS is either fixed or replaced.  The top of the unit was extremely hot and it is just totally dead and unresponsive.  Not even a light.<br /><br />I saw all of the bad reviews but there aren't many drawer microwave options and even brands like Wolf and Thermadore are still produced by Sharp.  Very disappointing.  We'll see how the service from Sharp goes...
I bought this microwave for my parents for Christmas. After six months it died.  My father has been attempting to get his refund processed for the past month and they keep giving him the run around. Don't buy this product!!!
I bought this microwave based on the Consumer Reports product ratings and up until a couple of days ago I would have highly recommended it. Unfortunately that is no longer the case. I awoke to sounds of it beeping every few minutes and an error code of SE. After a lot of research I have seen that this same code has appeared for a fair amount of others. Both the short and the long of it is that it can no longer be used with out spending good money after bad. I know that they don't make things now days to last a lifetime, but I would have hoped for it to last longer than less than 2 years. We are light users and I kept it very clean. I wish that I would have bought an extended warranty. I can only hope that I go the same way this did...quick and without warning and that someone would also say she was good while she lasted.
I bought this microwave August 2012. It died November. The operator's manual stated that, to avoid trip charges, I should take it GE Customer Care services and pick it up following service. Called up 1-800-GECARES, as given in the manual, to inquire on where to take it for service. There was no option to do that. They want to make a service call and charge $80 trip fee.<br /><br />Stay away from GE Products. They're defective and service is poor.
I bought this microwave at a deep discount from a friend who was going through a split.  It was almost new and I was able to remove and install it myself.  Despite a cracked plastic part on the front door (prior owner said this happened within the first month), this microwave lasted about 2 or 3 years before having some erratic heating issues;  at full power, sometimes the food coming out was as cold as when I put it in.  I got around this by selecting 90% cooking power.  This worked for another year or so before eventually having erratic cooking no matter what I did.  Last week the microwave shutdown within the first 10 seconds of heating.  Unplug and plug the unit would reset it, but same issue if I tried cooking.  Later that day, tried cooking again, this time the timer would run but no cooking (and the usual fan noise didn't start either).<br /><br />This $1000 Whirlpool Easy-bake has clearly cooked itself.  A microwave at this price SHOULD be bulletproof.  Clearly it is not. Based upon other reviews here, Whirlpool suckered us Velos owners into subsidizing their purchase of the other GOOD brands.<br /><br />Ironic that I need to buy a Haier microwave just to get a decent quality microwave (ie non-Whirlpool family brands)
I bought this microwave about a year ago.  The exterior is attractive, and it fit well into the space I had for it.  However, after just one year of relatively infrequent use, the top of the cavity is flaking, with big chunks of paint now gone. I've had to throw away things I've cooked because there were flecks of paint falling from the top into my dish. It is ridiculous to have to replace a new and otherwise functional appliance. The replacement will not be a GE.
I bought this microwave a little over 2 years ago, and it was just okay. I really didn't like the way it functioned compared to previous microwaves I have owned. but it looked good, and worked fine; UNTIL YESTERDAY.<br /><br />Out of nowhere, it just went up in flames, it wasn't even in use at the time.<br /><br />The only one in the house was my 72 yr. old mother-in-law, she said she noticed earlier that morning, the display on the microwave was off and she was unable to use it (as if it was unplugged). A while later, the house filled with smoke. Smoke and  flames were shooting out of the top vent of the microwave. She said there was so much smoke she could not even see in the kitchen.  She called 911, the fire dept was dispatched, and she exited our home. By the time they arrived the fire had burned out on its own, and the damage was contained to the internals of the microwave. The fire crew removed the microwave from my home, and inspected the home to insure that the microwave was indeed the cause of the fire. Thankfully there was no damage to our home other than the microwave itself, and a strong odor of smoke and burnt plastic (I'm sure it will take weeks to get rid of the smell).<br /><br />I contacted Samsung, to report what happened and am awaiting a response from the Executive Customer Relations dept. do to the nature of the incident.<br /><br />I'm not really sure what I want from them, more than anything to create awareness. Maybe they will issue a recall, based on this and all of the negative reviews I have read here on Amazon. I would encourage others having problems with this model to report it to Samsung. It may not do you much good, but who knows, you could save a life or something.<br /><br />UPDATE 01/31/2014:<br />Samsung Executive Customer Relations department contacted me on 01/20/2014 (MLK Holiday), by telephone (cell phone). I was asked to provide the microwave serial number but did not have it with me, so we agreed that I would provide it via email. A short time later I received an email asking to provide the serial number as Samsung would like to locate a service center to diagnose the unit.  I responded later that day with the serial number.<br /><br />On 01/21/2014 I received a response which stated, based on the serial number provided, the microwave is out of warranty, but due to the nature of the problem Samsung will cover the cost of diagnostics, and a service center will contacting me.<br /><br />On 01/22/2014 I received a call from the service center informing me they received the service order from Samsung, but it states the microwave is out of warranty so I will be responsible for the payment, I asked them to double check with Samsung, but they said I would have to contact them. I sent an email explaining what the service center said, and a few hours later Samsung responded with a One time Accommodation for the labor which I assume was also sent to the service center.<br /><br />A few days later the service center contacted me again, explaining they received the accommodation from Samsung, and asked if I could deliver the microwave to them, which I agreed (they were only about 1 mile from my home).<br /><br />On 01/29/14 the service center contacted me to explain that several parts in the microwave short circuited, and required replacement.  They explained that the accommodation was for diagnostic labor only, and any further repair would be my responsibility.  They asked for direction; explaining that the parts required are expensive, and the repair would most likely exceed the cost of replacement.<br /><br />I sent another email to Samsung explaining the call from the service center.  I explained that I made it a point to buy appliances from well know major brands such as Samsung with the expectation of higher quality and long life.  I asked that given the fact the unit failed due to a short circuit, after such a short life, under normal residential use, that they consider replacing the microwave at no cost, despite the fact the warranty period had ended.  Not to mention it almost burned my house down.<br /><br />It has been over 48 hours sense the email was sent and I have not received a response from Samsung. I have instructed the service center to recycle the microwave if they do not hear otherwise from me (or Samsung) by Monday (today is Friday).<br /><br />If I get a response from Samsung, I will update the review.he microwave at no cost, despite the fact the warranty period had ended.

I bought this microwave a few years back. Broke a year ago, waited a year to get it fix. This morning technician replaced inverter, worked......than he noticed it was on and off heating. Didn't warm up a cup of water. Told me the magnetron would need to be replaced. All about $500. STAY AWAY! Can't believe I spent $1,000 on this and 3 years later it's near the curb.......damn.....what an idiot I am....thanks Whirlpool...
I bought this micro to go on my boat because of its compact size and can fit into a corner.  Even rebuilt my cabinet on the boat to accomodate it. Now I have found out it will not operate on an inverter
I bought this LG microwave (LMV1680ST) as part of a full kitchen remodel a year ago. Upon first use, the microwave sparked and then made an unusually loud humming when on. Nothing heated. It broke on the first use. Home Depot, of course, said LG had to come out to deal with it. Since it was installed and not something I could easily take back to the store, I had to contact LG and schedule first a service consultation and THEN a service. What a pain. Now, less than a year later, the microwave is broken again. Since I bought it a few months before installation it's now out of warranty and LG wants to charge me $150 just to come out and inspect it. Don't buy it!! I threw away $200 on it and will just have to replace aNd pay for ANOTHER installation.
I bought this less than three years ago.  I seldom use it to heat food.  I only used it for light, fan and timer.  Now, it keeps on beeping and the technician said it will cost me $160 to $200 to repair it.
I bought this in 2011, and it needed repair (outside of warranty) to the control panel in 2012. The control panel just died again (May 2014), and Samsung won't help. They did offer a free diagnostic visit, but after I asked to speak to a supervisor, they withdrew the offer for the free diagnosis. Chintzy product, poor customer service.
I bought this GE microwave yesterday -- but not from Amazon, from Best Buy (only because I needed it right away). I unpacked the box and set it up. It would not work at all -- the display continually says Door (despite multiple clearing steps, resets, unplug/plug in, etc.). This display error message is not even addressed in the manual. I spent 30 minutes of my first day of ownership on the phone with GE support. The answer from them was obvious -- sorry, the door safety switch must not work properly. They gave all the usual excuses, sorry-sorry-sorry, please arrange for us to service it or repack it and drive it back to the store. Nice job GE -- an American name product and customer service at its finest, and you wonder why people buy alternative Asian name products. Best Buy should stop stocking GE products if this is GE's idea of quality control. Don't they check that products work when switched on before final packaging? I should not have to drive all the way back to the store. GE is wasting my time.<br /><br />Even more interesting -- I gave a negative one-star review of the microwave on the GE customer review section -- and their verification department that controls what is said on their website about their products, rejected my commentary. They have, however, allowed 14 reviews ranging from 3 to 5 stars. Here is the text of their rejection email to me:<br /><br />We appreciate you taking the time to write a review on JES0736SPSS; however, your review did not meet the guidelines for posting on our site.<br />We encourage you to revisit our guidelines and resubmit your review on JES0736SPSS<br /><br />I then read the GE guidelines, and NOTHING in my submission contravened the commentary guidelines -- it just happens to be a one star review from a very unhappy customer. GE does not like criticism. This experience has further reaching effects -- I am also looking at buying a new high end kitchen refrigerator -- GE was on my list, but no longer.
I bought this appliance over a year ago and since then have been having a lot of problems with the door. The plastic handle cracked a few months after use, and this was repaired by their service. A few months later, the same problem occurred again, but this time created a tiny crack on the door itself. Again it was serviced for the handle alone. Just after the 1-year warrantee expired, the handle cracked the 3rd time, this time creating a much bigger fissure on the door so that it now cannot be opened. While the machine still functions, the design of the door is so poor that I would not at all buy another microwave from LG again. In all the houses I have owned, this is the first time I have any problems with any microwave.I would not at all recommend it.
I bought my microwave directly from Whirlpool in March 2011. In July 2011 it died. The first repair man came out a week later. He order parts waited another week , second repair man came out to put in the new part. He said it was fried & could not be fix. Well whirlpool is supposed to be replacing the microwave. It's 4 week later close to 5 weeks & still no microwave. The service department is awful.
I bought it, I got it, I tried it, I returned it. 'Nuff said! Seriously, it doesn't appear to be a lasting product.
I am very disappointed at the poor reliability of this unit.  Ours is less than a year old and has failed--now, when attempting to cook, the unit shuts off before the end of the programmed time.  Even though the light comes on and the turntable turns, the unit does not heat food.  Like others, I purchased this unit based on the recommendation in Consumer Reports; this recommendation didn't pan out.  I tried to schedule warranty service and GE is making us wait a week to schedule and their frustrating telephone system does not provide information on where I can take it for service for faster turnaround (and didn't put me in touch with a live representative).    When the microwave oven worked, it worked fine.  We replaced a Sharp unit with this one; though this unit has the advantage of a larger capacity, its controls are less intuitive.    Based on poor reliability and poor service, we're certainly not going to buy another GE microwave.  We've had good success with GE refrigerators in the past; this is very disappointing.  A quick search on the web now reveals that GE microwave ovens are not reliable--many others appear to have similar problems with the magnetrons.    Perhaps this is one reason why GE is looking to sell its appliance business...
I am only adding my review so that I can lower the star count on this piece of garbage. I have no new information to add that has not already been thoroughly covered by the other reviewers. I also have the SE error and my microwave that just recently went out of warranty is now useless. DO NOT BUY SAMSUNG MICROWAVE OVENS...!!!
I am having the same issue but the keypad goes dark as soon as you press start so the error code does not come on. Samsung would not fix this. They want me to pay for a repairman to come out here to fix. After all of the reviews you would think they would want to fix and save their reputation. I will never buy Samsung again, as I had a Tv that also had issues that they knew about and would not fix. If I pay for a repairman I might as well get a new microwave for that price and it won't be a Samsung!!!!!!
I am completely disappointed in this microwave.  It stopped working after about 16 months, hence it was beyond warranty.  Every microwave I have ever owned has lasted at least 5 years!  Now Whirlpool wants to charge me $100.00 service fee?  This despite all of the documented magnetron issues in the reviews, yet they claim to not have any documented problems with this model.  DO NOT purchase a microwave from Whirlpool.  It's beautiful to look at, but now it's just a giant (pricey) paperweight hanging above my range.  I'll never buy anything from them again! It doesn't DESERVE a star, and neither does Whirlpool's customer service!
I am changing my five star to a one star review.<br /><br />The product cooked food well, but despite gentle use (we read reviews here noting a cracked door), our door has cracked, then cracked again, and then the handle itself has snapped off.  The material quality is very poor.  We were very gentle with this unit, but it's simply a very low quality product.<br /><br />Absolutely do not purchase this.
I absolutely cannot believe the experience we have had with this microwave model!!!  Take it off the freaking shelves already. RECALL IT.  The same issue over and over again - all within 6 to 8 months for each one that was replaced!  The unit just explodes with a horrible electric cracking sound while it is running.  There is an electrical short that fries the insides.  3 microwaves later, here we are once again calling the warranty man.  DO NOT BUY THIS MODEL!
I *hope* I sent in my warranty card!  I am calling the company today to request a refund.  I have not liked this microwave at all, and now it suddenly died.  I definitely want my money back.<br /><br />Edited:<br />I called the company and they told me to call Amazon.  I called Amazon and they issued a full refund.<br /><br />I do not recommend this microwave.  It is so flimsy that I had to hold it still with one hand in order to push buttons with the other.  Otherwise, it would slide across the counter.
How did our landlord get all new appliances and choose this awful contraption?!? The incessant beeping is driving me a little mad and, of course, there's no way to change that. Reviews for this thing being awful go back to 2-4 years ago. Just a little internet search could have saved me from this fate. I hope it dies soon.
Horrible waiting for a refund
Haven't returned item because seem to be complicated return policy and not given clear answer on step. The actually ad is different than the actual product.
Have owned this microwave for about 2.5 years. Has been a great performer albeit a bit longer cooking times because of it's low wattage. However, about 6 months ago the interior paint began to chip. There is now about one third of the inside paint missing. Have read numerous complaints regarding this problem on other sites so ours is not an isolated incidence. Most consumer info that is available states that the chipping paint is not unsafe. I don't know about you but I don't prefer my food with paint chips in it. I'm sure soon it will start sparking from all of the exposed metal. Haven't replaced it yet as we can't find a replacement to fit our space requirements.
Have had this microwave for just a year and it has stopped working. The &#34;door&#34; signal comes on when I push the start button, even though the door is properly closed and it won't start. Very disappointed in the quality of this product. Pathetic that it stops working after only a tear of light use. Anyone else have this problem?
Has been owned for less than a year.. started sparking and had to stop using.  Now shopping for a new one.
Had unit professionally installed 2 year ago but it has a habit of turning itself on. Had been doing that and latest episode is using it and it wouldn't go off. Have to unplug it after every use until latest episode. This unit is unsafe and dangerous.--- JVM1540DMWW. Stay away from it!!!
Had to return it , received less than half the $ I paid for it.  Bulky, odd shape very difficult to find suitable space for it. Like I had an old TV on my counter. UGLY very .ugly
Had this microwave for only 18 month and the door latching spring broke.  Now I can't close the door, and nothing works.
Had this microwave for 3 years with very little usage within that period of time. The infamous F7 error code showed up and service rep replaced the inverter and still had a problem after inverter replacement. After a $400 repair bill, the inverter was only partial problem. The magnetron has to be replaced for another $200. Whirlpool use to be a great appliance to purchase but now I would not suggest buying another whirlpool appliance.
Had the same issue as Trina on reviews. I purchased via the USA and had shipped to Canada via a freind. Manufactured Oct 2013 and used 5 times before it died. Sharp basically told me to take a hike because of no cross border warranty. My kitchen reno is not even done and this thing has already failed and cost me $250 to have fixed. garbage product, garage service, garabge company. Stay away !!!
Gues what 14 months after buying It happened to me  We will try Samsung To morrow If no help everthing called Samsung is going to the recycling bin
Got it detected right from the box... The lights work, control panel etc, but it doesn't produce any heat! 5 minutes and nothing... Really sad about the quality. Amazon send me a broken device.
Googled by the model number and brought me here to see what a piece of crap that Whirlpool have made.<br />This is suppose be the upgraded version that my builder put in, yet with hardly any usage, this thing crap out on me.<br />I am the 35th customer that's pissed off of owning this crap.<br /><br />It is amazing that Whirpool have the balls to sell this microwave at all.<br /><br />Never ever going to get anything from Whirpool ever again.
fridgidaire over the range (fmv 156 dca) looks nice but nothing but trouble.  First the handle broke. I fixed it. Then the diode/rectifire failed--i replaced that and the magnitron, worked for a year than died in the middle of cooking a baked potatoe. Replaced diode--still not working. I am giving up and never buying fridigaire again.  BTW i replaced it with a maytag--what do you know, as soon as i tried to cook some popcorn it shut off. It only will stay on for 10 seconds or so before shutting off. I am taking it back and am wondering how much bad luck can one have--or is this all a conspiracy to keep microwave service people busy.
Evidently this is a common problem with Samsung microwaves: the keypad shorted out after less than two years of use, resulting in the microwave, stove light, and exhaust fan becoming inoperable.  The cost of repair- for labor only- would have been $150 for an item that originally cost $220.  After several calls to Samsung's Executive Customer Relations department, I was curtly informed that Samsung is unwilling to take ANY action to remedy this situation.  My only option at this point is to replace the microwave - NOT with a Samsung product- as I have no way of running the exhaust fan in my newly-remodeled kitchen. And even worse, due to some new environmental law, I will have to PAY to dispose of this worthless piece of junk.<br /><br />Samsung does not stand behind the products they sell. Samsung has atrocious customer service.  Across the board their products get poor reviews, yet they are unwilling to take any action to correct the problem and maintain good customer relations. They appear to operate under the assumption that  for every dissatisfied customer, there are thousands more willing to buy their shoddy crap. This attitude is unacceptable, especially in these tough economic times.<br /><br /> I will NEVER buy ANY Samsung product, EVER!  Save yourself the aggravation:  DO NOT BUY!
E. J. Tastad's review of this product is accurate and appropriate, but I would like to add some additional information.  I bought this GE Profile microwave oven in March of 2006 on the recommendation of Consumer Reports.  In September 2009 I am sorry to report that I had to throw it out because it wasn't worth repairing.  Consumer Reports gave this GE model their top rating for large microwave ovens.  It replaced an old Amana RadarRange that I had used for about 25 years before it burst into flames.  The Amana had also received Consumer Reports top rating back then.  If I recall, my Amana sold for about twice as much money (in 1981 dollars) as this GE costs in 2006 dollars.<br /><br />Since this microwave oven is more powerful, faster and consumes more electricity than small models, you may need to have a dedicated 20 ampere outlet available for its use.  Compared with my old Amana, the GE has a much more uniform distribution of heat when cooking or reheating, probably because the food is rotated on a turntable.  As E. J. Tastad found, the defrost cycle is easy to use, gives good distribution of heat and the front panel controls are fairly intuitive.  The stainless steel cabinet is attractive and easy to clean.<br /><br />Unlike my old Amana, this oven cannot multi-task.  For example, if you're running the built-in clock timer, you cannot cook or reheat something on a different schedule using different functions.  You must stop the clock timer to begin a cook cycle and vice versa.  You also cannot program several sequences of automatic operations as my old Amana could accommodate, nor can you program it to start at a later time.<br /><br />This microwave oven was not as reliable and did not last nearly as long as my old Amana did.  The magnetron tube in my GE Profile microwave oven failed after two years of use.  It's replacement was covered by the five-year GE warranty on the tube, but the warranty didn't cover the $85 in labor charges, which would have been even more if I had received the service on-site instead of taking the appliance to the appliance repair depot.  After 3 1/2 years of use, (September 2009) the main circuit board self-destructed.  It cost me $44 at the nearest GE repair facility to learn that it would cost me more than another $200 to replace the microwave oven's circuit board.<br /><br />Since other brands of similar-sized and power microwave ovens cost less than the repairs, I have discarded this microwave oven after 3 1/2 years and after spending $129 in diagnostic and repair charges in addition to the purchase price.  Given this experience, I now be hard-pressed to recommend this appliance considering its cost-of-ownership and short life.  This appliance should have lasted much longer.  It did not get heavy use and was never misused or abused.<br /><br />When I contacted GE about my failed microwave oven, they promised to make things right, asked for the model and serial number and requested that I cut off the appliance's power cord and plug and send it to them.  They then sent me a $100 rebate check that could be applied ONLY to another GE appliance purchase.  The check expired before I found another GE appliance that I wanted to own.<br /><br />I bought a replacement, which was a Panasonic model NN-SD978S microwave oven for less than $200 from Sam's Club.  It is just as large, cooks faster and has proven to be far more reliable.  After four years, it's still going strong without need for repairs.ore if I had received the service on-site instead of taking the appliance to the appliance repair depot.

Door broke near the handle in less than one year.  Had the door replaced under warranty.  Now the new door is breaking in the exact same fashion in less than a year (but now it's out of warranty!).  New door costs over $100.  Serious design or manufacturing flaw.  I can't recommend this microwave.  Very disappointed.
Don't Buy!!!!  Our old version of the GE Profile caught fire while heating up something.  Fortunately our 8 yr. old son was in the room and was able to get my husband's attention before it escalated.  However, while trying to replace our microwave, we found that the only item we could replace it with was a GE microwave, either the Profile (which is the downgraded version of our former product) or a GE Monogram (the exact same unit as our old profile with a different name and much higher pricetag).  GE's response was to replace the item with the lower level model Profile (which we originally tried to replace it with but was falling apart after a couple of uses).  In order to get the exact same microwave (now called the Monogram) we had to pay an additional $335 for the upgrade.  Getting the microwave delivered in a timely and convenient fashion was another debacle.  Sadly, we are stuck using this GE product because our cabinets were built around the original, and nothing else will fit.
Don't buy this microwave. I had the board fail in two weeks. Got it replaced. This microwave is extremely loud. LG supposed to be a good brand product that I knew, The turntable stopped working just after one year after the warranty expired. It will cost more to repair than buy new. Sucks!! I will go for a different brand.
Dont buy it!!!<br />The button will be defective after 8 months
Dont buy frigidaire. I bought a set of appliances (this being one of them) and the only one I havent had issues with is the stove so far. Haven't even had the stuff a full year.
Does not work will be sending back
does not keep ice cold . if you like cold drinks don't purchase . great cool collectable but it functional
DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PIECE OF CRAP! DANBY NEEDS TO LEARN HOW TO BUILD A FUNCTIONAL APPLIANCE.
DO NOT BUY!<br />We just got the SE error after 2.5 years - they know about the problem and haven't fixed it.  I looked it up on the internet after this happened and tons of people have this problem.  I'm not going to pull the whole thing apart to fix it and then have it happen again.  If they know the moisture causes the key pad to fail then why do they have it above a range where you boil water!
Do not buy this.  You would get better value by throwing money out into the street.  Mine lasted three weeks, and then became entirely useless.  If you buy one of these and pay for it, you will end up with no money and no microwave.
DO NOT BUY THIS!
Do not buy this ever. When door closes it automatically turns on and you are unable to start any kind of cooking options, very annoying. Only a 30 day return policy too.
Do not buy a Samsung Microwave.  Purchased smh1816w January 2013 and in December 2013 stopped working have had 6 service calls and as of April 29 2014 still not working.  A&E service has replaced all parts multiple times to try to correct problem however with no luck.  Samsung is unwilling to replace the unit or refund the money paid which would be preferred. I will never purchase a Samsung product again.
Disapointed in the fan suction. Doesn't seem to be pulling the air from over the stove, almost like there is a ducting leak, because there is plenty of air blowing.
DIFFICULT to install, even with two people, mostly the taking down of the old greasy unit. Came with a BROKEN FAN and hence no exhaust. Whirlpool sending a repairman after a week with no microwave. Will he bring the correct parts and be able to fix it?? Impossible to return as box is not a box but styrofoam and cardboard on top and bottom with shrink wrap holding it all together. If you want one of these get it at Best Buy and save $50.00.  It's now a month since we installed the unit and the fan has been replaced (part had to be ordered). Turns out we could use the microwave without the fan. All arranged thru Whirlpool with local repairman fixing it in place.
Died after a year, &#34;service may be needed, keyboard shorted&#34; message , was told the replacement part cost $165 for smart board but may also need a new keypad $150....never again with GE products....buyers beware !!!!
Did not work so I returned it
Danby model DMW111KBLDB will heat for less than a minute then shows an error code and stops.  Bottom of right side gets very hot.  Brand new, returning it for sure.  Perhaps another brand will do better.     Danby promotes themselves as one of the largest household appliance marketing companies in North America.  Aren't they the manufacturer of this product?
Damn good clock but not a valid microwave. Magnatron fried just like the other reviews. Whirlpool should be called Swirlpool because you are sending money down the drain when you purchase their products.
Cooling fan vents out of the front of unit.  Only vent fan opens exhaust louver.  Vent fan is manual only unlike implied in user guide.  If manual vent not operated in conjunction with any cooking then possibility exists of damaging cabinets.  Strongly recommend getting a normal exhaust / vent fan and a countertop microwave.
Cheaply put together.  Very low quality for the amount of money spent. Spend a little more and get a quality product.
Cheap quality.<br />But you always get what you pay for :(
Can someone tell me how to make the door open more easily????????<br /><br />I bought this microwave to sit on top of refrigerator - only place I have for one but the door is so hard to open that by the time I've punched the &#34;open&#34; bar enough to get the thing open, the oven has moved back away from my reach so have to climb on stool and pull it back forward and then put food in.<br /><br /> UPDATE March 6, 2015 -  After buying the nonslip product as suggested by reply to earlier review, the nonslip sits unopened.  Instead, the microwave sits unplugged like a small dead dinosaur on top of my refrigerator.  For 70 years since my grandfather built this little house, a refrigerator has been plugged into the the receptacle behind it including for 20 years my various ones.<br /><br />It took this Danby microwave less than two months of less than stellar service to trip the breaker for the first time.  Even with the electrician installed updated breaker box, the Danby managed to screw it up.  After unplugging the Danby and waiting, I tried again to reset the breaker and it worked.  I now have a refrigerator again but have no microwave.<br /><br />To use, this microwave oven had to be almost punched to open its door.  Then adjust turntable so it would turn.  Then add some more time with the 30-second add button.  Then punch it again to open the door.  Meanwhile, from the punching, the oven has slid away from reach so get out the stepstool  Just touching a numbered button DOES NOT begin to set the time.  Instead, that starts &#34;express&#34; time of minutes for the number I touched.
Came with a huge dent in the side.
Came in brand new package but item doesn't work at all.
Came damaged, but did not see til after use. Hard to read, just not worth the money. Put in garage and went back to our $59 sams club microwave
Buy anything else, just don't buy this piece of junk.  Multiple electrical problems, a door lock that failed, poor performance and lousy customer service all at a premium price.  You can buy better but you probably can't pay more.
Broke in less then 60 days
Bought under 3 years ago.  First the door stopped closing fully unless you slammed it.  Now all it does is work for 5 seconds and then stops working.  Total JUNK!  Total waste of money.  Now I need to buy a new microwave...AGAIN!
Bought this product a while ago. Handle breaks off over time. GE knows of the problem. Charges $60 for the handle and delivers it without screws. One of those broke as well. On line parts support says the handle does not come with screws and there is nothing they can do. Live and learn.
Bought this microwave in June 2012 for a kitchen remodel. Its barley 5 months old and although I have not experienced the dreaded 5E error, the unit has already started acting funny. The last few days the unit will loose the time and display please set time. This AM while making oat meal for my daughter, I opened the unit and it was dead. No light like it was unplugged. Closed and the display listed all 0's across. Opened door again no light. After a few times the light went on and unit was operational. Subsequently  I did do the stop/enter key diagnostic test and all it showed me was 1816s (model) and 110512A, which I assume means 1105watts 12amps? I hope this is not a precursor to the 5E error? Thinking the seller acquired refurbished units from another party (i.e.Samsung, Lowes?) and has been pawning them off as new here. I am going to check to see if my appliance repair plan that I pay for from my utility company will covers microwaves, if not new unit for me.
Bought the Sharp R-1874 in November 2006 and immediately noticed that the entire unit appeared to be of flimsy construction.  Now the door will not seal properly and it will only work in the micro or convection mode if the user continually keeps pressure on the latch.  A ridiculous situation.     Sharp USA was no help and a repairman gave me a $230 quote to fix it.
Bought th microwave about 24 months ago and it died last night.  No error but smell of electrical material was evident.  I was fearfully of a fire breaking out.  We unplugged it and called samsung.  They instructed us in troubleshooting but to no avail.  I then started to read reviews and now I plan to replace with another brand because this is a dangerous<br />Appliance.  Definitely not worth repairing for both financial and safety reasons.  I advise not yo buy samsung this appliance should have been recalled
Bought Over The Range GE Microwave PVM1790SR1 SS Unpacked it. Before installing , plugged it in to test.It started automatically, control panel went dark no amount of pressin STOP/CANCEL button would stop it from running.<br />Returned the product yesterday.
Bought GE's 2006 model. It became a bread box/clock four days ago (about 9/15/2012). Scheduled one of their authorized repair men. Took him 5 minutes to determine that the only problem was that the microwave generator thingy quit. The display, oven light and turntable are as good as new, but the micro doesn't heat anything. Cost of the part = $400. The good news is that the $75 house call will be offset by getting a coupon redeemable for $100 if I buy another GE Profile over-the-range. My cheap, little, off brand counter top microwave just won't quit working. I'm not certain what to do.<br /><br />One last thing, the halogen surface light quit about six weeks after original purchase. You have to stand on your head, and use a special backhanded screw driver to replace the bulbs. Very convenient feature, but maybe I should have paid an authorized repair tech to replace the bulbs.
Bought a Sharp Microwave Drawer one and a half years ago. Barely used it - warming leftovers once a week and softening butter a few times. Started to make funny noises and gave off an electrical smell. Because I bought it from an American Supplier - Sharp Canada is saying I have no warranty and suggest that I send the microwave to a family member in the US to have it repaired. This is ludicrous. Sharp US says I have to deal with Sharp Canada. To get it repaired here it will cost $286. Either way it will cost a small fortune to repair.
Beware. I bought this over the range microwave in March of 2009, and it stopped working completely yesterday (Feb 25 2010). I use it once or twice per day. Normal stuff like TV dinners. It looks very nice, but it was NOT built to last.  I bought it online and I'm hunting through my archived e-mails trying to find my receipt so that I can get it serviced (preferably REPLACED). Earliest appointment is in a week, so I am without a microwave for at least a week.
Be purchased all Bosch appliances in 2011.<br /><br />Refrigerator went out twice. It was past warranty so Bosch would not cover. Then we found out it was covered through the Good Housekeeping seal of approval. Once we got them involved it was eventually repaired then replaced after more and more problems.<br /><br />Now microwave ( HMV 3051) completely died. Only 2.5 years old with moderate use. Bosch will not help and unfortunately it does not have Good Housekeeping seal. We will replace with non Bosch model that does
At first we loved this microwave drawer and it seemed to do the core job of heating food just fine.  Then just over a year after the purchase date (when the builder bought all the appliances) the unit died.  No signs of life at all.  It had been in use for 3-4 months in total.  Microwaves have been around for a long time and most are pretty much bulletproof.  Not this one.  Reading the reviews it is obvious that Sharp has built a flawed product and is not standing behind it.  I have called them twice and asked about a product recall, and if they were going to escalate the product defect issues to their development team.  No response.  It's obvious that their customer service teams do not close the loop and provide feedback to their engineering and business teams.  For this price, this is an unbelievable rip off.  Yes it looks great, but it doesn't work much more than a year.  Now we're stuck, with the prospect of paying for service, and then waiting until it breaks again.  Since this is likely a low volume unit, the number of consumer complaints won't be adequate to force Sharp to own up to the obvious quality issues.
Arrived full of dents and broken exhaust mount. Had to have GE Repair come over and send a replacement.  Seller should have replaced unit but GE made it work out.  Oven seems like it will be okay but GE does have their problems.  Let's see if this one lasts longer than 3 years, the GE oven I replaced did not.
Appliance was the right one to match my other appliances but did not work on power up. There is not a service tech that is backed by the company seller. So it had to be sent back. My money was refunded pronto but I would rather have the applince
Among the other problems mentioned, the glass panel in the door shatters when the convection oven goes over 400 degrees. And don't even think about installing a new door yourself, as GE insists only their repair people can do the work for $150 plus the cost of the door. Zero stars would be totally appropriate.
Amazing that such a reputable company would put out such a poorly thought out product.<br /><br />Everyone should know by now that the most important part of a microwave oven is the user interface.  Afterall, a microwave oven has one power setting that must be somehow regulated by an on/off switch  - so I am amazed that Frigidaire could mess that up so.<br /><br />For instance:  when it is done cooking - the 3 loud beeps go off VERY SLOWLY.  During which time it is impossible to add time, or even to stop the beeping.  You can open the door, but it still beeps;  you can not push the stop button, because until the beep is done - NOTHING ELSE WORKS -  This thing is robbing my time a few seconds at a time.<br /><br />Who is the Frigidaire executive that pushed this forward with out simple end user testing?<br /><br />Skip it... Underpowered for it's size and frustrating to use.
Although they look pretty, we will also never buy another Frigidaire product. Bought a package from another retailer at a reasonable price for what we thought were top-of-the-line Frigidaire products. In less than two years both the microwave and dishwasher needed major repair within a week of one another.....the micro for $240 and the dishwasher for $350.  Repairman recommended we chalk both up as a loss and replace with a different brand as he has seen lots of problems with the Frigidaire product.  Recommend to buyers that you spend a little more upfront because you will save in the end.
Although I did not buy this microwave on line, I feel the need to warn potential buyers.  Caveat Emptor.<br />Unless you really like loud appliances, do not buy this one.  It sounds like a jet about to take off. I expected it to sound like a normal microwave. Not, a 747. One may think I am making a mountain out of a molehill, but I am hard of hearing and it is still loud to me.  I can only imagine what it sounds like to one with normal hearing.  'Nuff said.
All purchase and shipping activities were fine. Microwave door on this model not well designed. It sticks and won't open or close properly if the unit is not perfectly level meaning installation under cabinet must be virtually perfect. Appliance repair person told me this is always a problem with this model. Wish I knew that before purchasing.
After using the microwave for 1 week, it stopped working.  I just sent it back and waiting for a replacement.  I will give sharp 1 more chance.
After UPS destroyed a Whirlpool unit last week, I opted to upgrade to this GE model.  The mistake I made was allowing UPS to handle the shipment again.  It is becoming apparent that UPS cannot handle anything that requires a hand truck without damaging it.  I would suggest that Amazon include a carrier option for shipping heavy items to possibly preclude damage in shipment.  For me, UPS would fall just below the kid down the street with his little red wagon.  As to the GE microwave, it arrived with two corners completely bashed in and assorted other small dents.  Not exactly a 30,000 foot drop, but enough to render it unusable.  If I'm ever able to once again enjoy receiving, installing and using an over-the-range microwave oven, I'll be sure to review its salient points.  Oh, and all potential buyers should be aware that if you purchase any item like this from a vender who does not have the caveat fulfilled by Amazon next to their name,and you have to return the item, you will simply have to wait for the item to arrive back at the vender and then rely on the vender to reimburse the cost.  Amazon cannot reimburse for it - you MUST wait for the vender.  Me?  I'm still waiting for my $500. Caveat Emptor!<br />September 13 - Update - Item arrived back at the vender today.  I'm still waiting for my $500.
After two years, the microwave died yesterday involved in black smoke. Luckily we were able to manage  the mess before the whole house burned down. Stay away from this company.
After the smoke has cleared from the house, discovered microwave burnt out.  Thank God for Home Warranty!  Don't buy! YUCK!  Can't believe the reviews- all universally the same, except mine lasted just under a year!  It's a crying shame a product fails so soon!
After owning this microwave for less than 3 years, we have had the door handle break off on the bottom TWICE!  The first time we had it fixed - which cost nearly as much as the microwave.  This was just over 1 year after purchasing (of course, because it was no longer under warranty).  Now, just over three years in, it has broken off again - exact same problem.  Oh, AND the glass on the front of the door somehow came undone on the top and fell down about two inches.  Absolutely the worst appliance we have ever owned.  I have also had problems with my LG dryer after less than 4 years of owning it.  LG should track down everyone who purchased this microwave and give them a refund.  I will never, ever buy another LG product again, no matter what type.
After our GE Caf茅 microwave touchpad went out after only 3 years GE said it would cost $800 to fix.  So we purchased this advantium oven.  It shipped and would not heat up.  We returned it but ended up getting a Breville countertop for $299 that we like much better.
After only two years of owning this microwave it started arcing when started. I looked into replacing the HV Diode and the HV Capacitor but those parts were damaged because the magnetron went bad. It was cheaper to replace the whole microwave than order parts and fix myself. Truly disappointed in Whirlpool and their products. The matching Whirlpool gold french door fridge we bought at the same time just had almost $1,000 worth of repairs. After only two years!!! These are cheaply made disposable pieces of garbage.
After about 18 months of working beautifully, we also got that SE error. Called an authorized dealer and between the cost of a service call, the price of labor and the price of the new keypad, it will cost $200 to fix.  No way!!  I will be purchasing a new microwave and it will most definitely NOT be a Samsung!! Time to issue a recall like they do with cars...they know who has registered this product. We should all be given replacement keyboards free of charge. We need lemon laws for appliances. I urge you to stay away from this one.<br /><br />***UPDATE***<br />I spoke with the authorized service provider and he suggested I contact Samsung directly (1-800-726-7864). I spoke with customer service and then was transferred to Executive Customer Relations. They first offered me a free replacement part but told me I would have to pay for the service call and any labor charges. I told her that was not acceptable as that would still cost me $135. She put me on hold again and came back telling me she could give me as a courtesy a ONE TIME ONLY warranty extension. She made it clear it would not ever be repeated. So, at least now I will have the repair done at no cost to me. Hopefully the new part will last longer than the original.  I suggest you try giving them a call if you are one of the many with this problem.
After about 10 uses...yes, 10 uses, the microwave heating element broke.  It was under warranty but this product is horrible.  all looks, no performance.  Filing a BBB complaint and one with Sharp as well.  $1K is too much for this bag of magic beans.
After 17 months there was a popping sound, and electrical smell and it died. We just warmed food up in it. No serious cooking. It is a great size and convenient. Is it worth the price for a year and a half of service? It lost the high setting about 6 months ago but we didn't care too much. You might want to pass on this model.
After 16 months the board that controls the keypad died. The repair estimate was twice what I paid for the microwave! Repair person told me to get a whirlpool or LG next time.
Add us to the long list of dissatisfied customers.  We already replaced the board once, and now, a year later, it went out again, suddenly, for no specific reason.  We heated up a bowl of chowmein for seven minutes. . . whoopee.  It's amazing that Samsung would not recall these microwaves or at least make the replacement part reasonably priced, but it's not worth buying the part, even to replace it yourself.  If you choose to purchase this microwave, do so with plans to throw it away in a year or so.<br /><br />Also, be aware that you have to specifically insist to the rep that you heard about the special one time repair that Samsung is supposedly doing, because they are not doing it on OUR models, only specific ones.
Add me to the list of the great disgruntled.  Ours stopped working after a year and 4 months. It heats food, but the turntable doesn't spin and you can't change  anything on the touch screen.  Stick the food in and it just hums. A fire waiting to happen.<br /><br />Wish I would have read reviews here before I bought it.  It was the pretty one the wife loved lol. People are being honest about this lemon.  I did buy a square trade warranty after reading these reviews. Lucky and square trade is being good about it.
Absolute piece of junk from an unsavory seller. Do not buy this microwave. It was refurbished and I didn't know. The cord had been &#34;trimmed&#34; by the previous owner so it could fit through a hole, quite a surprise. Didn't come with templates to install, had to buy separate. Door closes way too hard and noisy.<br /><br />And now it's dead one year later! I had my previous microwave for 9 years.<br /><br />Total junk. Wish I could give the microwave zero stars.
Absolute junk currently trying to get second version of this microwave fixed or replaced. The first one died emitting a god awful blue smoke. Fortunately we bought the service agreement. Unfortunately still took more than a month to replace.  The replacement is also malfunctioning. The keypad started malfunction then the microwave started smoking now waiting for a resolution. Do  not buy look at consumer reports reviews this thing is a lemon
About two weeks prior to this microwave blowing up, we had a problem with it NOT turning off. It would stop if we opened the door, but once we closed the door, it continued to run - nothing showed on the keypad that it was running. We turned off the breaker and left it that way for about 24 hours. When we turned back on the breaker, it seemed to work fine until yesterday. We turned on the fan for about 30 minutes and then turned it off. During the next 20 minutes the microwave turned on by itself and we heard a loud explosion. The microwave was still running! We opened the door and the glass had exploded inside. When we closed the door, the microwave continued to run. We had to turn the breaker off. If we had left our home, the house would have caught fire!!!! We will be contacting Samsung and if they don't provide us with another microwave, we will issue a complaint for this fire hazard.
3 of the buttons stopped working after a month of using it. It was used twice a day. Do not recommend it. go use your money for something more durable. Oh and also big plates do not fit in it.
2 years ago we completely remodeled our kitchen and I was really excited when I found the KB-6524ps because I wanted a built-in microwave for the island. All the cabinets were custom made and one side of the island was designed to accommodate the KB-6524ps dimensions. For the first 13 months we loved this product, then the automatic open/close door feature stopped working. I called Panasonic and they were no help since it was out of warranty. I searched the internet for a authorized repair company and when I called them, they gave me a price of $295 to repair the problem (including travel), so we decided to live with manually opening and closing the door.<br /><br />3 months later, we were using the microwave and we noticed a burning smell. We shut the microwave off and waited a while and tried it again. Same thing only stronger smell. I called the same repair company and they told me the motor had gone and that this is a typical problem with these units. To replace the motor was $610 including travel. So we stopped using the microwave.<br /><br />2 weeks ago we had a problem with the ice maker on our new GE profile refrigerator so I call a GE repair company who also repairs and warranties other manufacturers' products. They came out and fixed the ice maker and since their repairs are warrantied for 5 years, I asked them to look at the microwave. They also said it was the motor but they would not repair it because they have found these unit have a tendency to catch fire.<br /><br />Well, I will never by another Panasonic product EVER. For the price of this unit and how cheaply made, I could find other ways to waste my money.<br /><br />I am purchasing the Bosch built-in to replace the Panasonic but I need to have the cabinet maker modify the opening since the Bosch is 1&#34; longer.
2 days after we had it installed it stopped heating food. During first service call we were told to unplug it and to let it reset. It still wasn't working. In the second service call we were instructed to turn the vent fan on manually when using the range top due to the microwave shutting down to avoid over-heating.  We immediately noticed that from that point on the microwave would not heat food unless the vent fan was running. (even if the stove was off and cold)  After the next service call, the microwave still wasn't heating food without the vent fan running despite the technician replacing a part and the microwave vibrating and humming whenever the vent fan was on after his repair.  We scheduled another service call.  The technician did not visit, stating that he had ordered a part that would solve the problem.  That was on May 15, 2014... it is now June 17th and we still don't have a working microwave. Disappointing for a $400 investment.<br /><br />Why:<br />I've ALWAYS recommended Samsung televisions and blue-ray players because they were excellent products with great features and no problems since 2009. The microwave I bought never worked properly and after 5 months and several service calls, it still does not work.  I'm afraid to spend any significant amount of money on a Samsung product if this is how defective merchandise is handled.<br /><br />UPDATE: October 25, 2014<br />After 7 months, countless hours on the phone with Samsung's customer service and about 7 to 9 service calls... we went back to Lowe's Home Improvement (we should have in the first place) and they IMMEDIATELY replaced it with a Whirlpool.<br /><br />I liked my Samsung Flat-screen TV so much that I was going replace my other 2 TVs with Samsungs. Their exceedingly poor service and support make it an absolute certainty that I will not buy a big-ticket item from them. On the off chance that you get a defective item, they will not make it right for you.
18 month old microwave will not stop running until unplugged, which is a complete fire hazard and deemed unsafe.  I will never purchase a Frigidaire product in my lifetime again, or recommend it to anyone.  This is not the first 18 month old Frigidaire product I will have to replace.  STOP NOW if you are considering this product brand!!!
[[VIDEOID:567df035967d824cead7d2509901668b]] The unit went out after the initial warranty had expired. The unit was listed as having a 10 year warranty on the Magnetron. The Magnetron (the main engine of the microwave). I jumped thru hopes for weeks (including taking videos of the product shooting flaming sparks) with Samsung warranty service only to be told that they do not have a service agreement near Arkansas. Another week passed and I spoke with them one the phone and they we finally agreed on a partial refund and they sent me an email confirming the amount.<br /> I said fine and went and bought another microwave. They never sent the refund and I called a week later and they said that I had to provide them parts from the original microwave???.......easily done if they had told me this before.!!  They never said a word about it either on the phone or email.<br />This unit should last longer than it did. I feel stupid that I have bought a kitchen full of Samsung appliances. Now if/when these break I will have to deal with the same deceptive people and lack of support again.....Steer clear !!
[[ASIN:B000UW1WW8 GE Profile : JES2251SJ 2.2 cu. ft. Countertop Microwave with Child Lockout and Extra Large<br />Capacity<br />I purchased this product less than two years ago & today it finally just stopped.This was considered a very good micro, however it should have lasted much longer. I no longer have any faith in GE products and would never recomend this product to anyone!
